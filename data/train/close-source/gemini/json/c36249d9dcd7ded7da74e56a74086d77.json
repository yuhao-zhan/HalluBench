      "description": "I'm starting to develop a detailed protocol for a randomized controlled trial. This involves a multi-faceted approach, combining knowledge from clinical trial design, pharmacology, gynecology, and statistics. I'm breaking down the process into several key steps to ensure all necessary components of a robust research protocol are covered.\nMy initial focus is on establishing a strong background and rationale for the study. This involves understanding the biological mechanisms behind primary dysmenorrhea, exploring the specific anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of matcha and chamomile, and reviewing existing research on herbal remedies for dysmenorrhea to identify current knowledge gaps that this trial can address. I'm approaching these areas in parallel to gather foundational information efficiently."

    "observation_1": "I've gained a deeper understanding of primary dysmenorrhea's pathophysiology. It's primarily driven by an excessive release of prostaglandins (PGF2α and PGE2) in the uterus during menstruation, leading to intense uterine contractions, reduced blood flow, and heightened pain sensitivity. This process is essentially an inflammatory response within the endometrium. This condition significantly impacts quality of life and is a major cause of absenteeism.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Properties of Matcha and Chamomile\nCurrent Evidence on Herbal Remedies\nNext Steps in Research",
      "description": "I've found that both matcha and chamomile possess anti-inflammatory properties. Chamomile's beneficial effects are attributed to its flavonoids and essential oils, which can inhibit prostaglandin E(2) release and suppress COX-2 activity. Matcha, derived from green tea, contains epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has demonstrated anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines. This suggests a plausible mechanism for their potential therapeutic effects in dysmenorrhea.\nMy review of existing research on herbal remedies for primary dysmenorrhea indicates that while some herbs, including chamomile, show promise, the overall quality of evidence from systematic reviews is often low. This highlights a significant gap in the literature and reinforces the need for more rigorous randomized controlled trials to establish the efficacy and safety of these interventions. The evidence for matcha in this specific context is less direct, warranting further investigation.\nMy next step is to delve deeper into the specific mechanisms of action and any existing clinical trial data for matcha and chamomile by browsing the gathered URLs. This will help me to build a robust rationale for the proposed study, focusing on how these compounds might modulate the prostaglandin-mediated inflammatory pathways identified in primary dysmenorrhea."

      "description": "I've confirmed the pharmacological properties of both matcha and chamomile that are relevant to pain and inflammation. Chamomile has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and reducing prostaglandin E2 release through the attenuation of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) enzyme activity. Matcha, through its key component epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), also exhibits anti-inflammatory actions by scavenging reactive oxygen species and attenuating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity. These mechanisms directly align with the prostaglandin-mediated inflammatory processes central to primary dysmenorrhea.\nWhile existing systematic reviews suggest some herbal remedies, including chamomile, may be effective for primary dysmenorrhea, the overall quality of evidence is often low. This highlights a significant research gap, particularly for matcha in this specific context, reinforcing the need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial. I have now gathered sufficient information on the pathophysiology, pharmacological properties of the interventions, and general trial design principles. My next step is to synthesize all the collected information into a comprehensive and detailed Randomized Controlled Trial protocol."

It is a leading cause of recurrent short-term absenteeism from school and work, compromising academic achievement and professional productivity.1 Women with PD report significantly poorer QoL, mood disturbances, and reduced sleep quality during menstruation compared to their pain-free follicular phase and to eumenorrheic controls.2 Despite its profound impact, PD remains a widely underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. This is largely due to societal normalization of menstrual pain, leading many women to suffer silently under the belief that their pain is an inevitable and untreatable part of the menstrual cycle.1\n\nThe pathophysiology of PD is well-characterized and primarily attributed to an excessive production and release of prostaglandins (PGs), particularly prostaglandin F2α​ (PGF2α​) and prostaglandin E2​ (PGE2​), from the uterine endometrium during menses.1 The menstrual cycle's late luteal phase is marked by a sharp decline in progesterone levels if conception does not occur. This hormonal withdrawal destabilizes endometrial cell lysosomes, leading to the release of phospholipase A2. This enzyme initiates the arachidonic acid cascade, converting membrane phospholipids into arachidonic acid, which is then metabolized by the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme pathway to produce PGs.3 Women with PD have been shown to have significantly higher concentrations of\n\nPGF2α​ and PGE2​ in their menstrual fluid compared to women without dysmenorrhea.3\n\nThis overabundance of PGs drives the primary symptoms of PD through several mechanisms. Prostaglandins are potent stimulators of myometrial contractility, leading to intense, frequent, and dysrhythmic uterine contractions, increased basal uterine tone, and elevated intrauterine pressure.1 These hypercontractile states can exceed arterial pressure, causing uterine vasoconstriction and ischemia (reduced blood flow), which results in localized hypoxia and the production of anaerobic metabolites that stimulate pain-sensitive nerve fibers.3 Beyond the uterus, elevated systemic levels of PGs can cause associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches.4 The underlying process is fundamentally inflammatory, involving not only PGs but also leukotrienes and a host of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).1 This inflammatory cascade provides a clear and specific set of targets for therapeutic intervention. Any compound capable of inhibiting the COX pathway, reducing PG synthesis, or mitigating the broader inflammatory response is a biologically plausible candidate for alleviating the symptoms of PD.\n\n### **1.2 Current Management Strategies and Their Limitations**\n\nThe standard of care for PD is based on its prostaglandin-mediated pathophysiology. First-line pharmacological therapy consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, which act by inhibiting the COX enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin production.5 NSAIDs have been shown to be superior to both placebo and acetaminophen for pain relief in PD.5 The second major therapeutic option is hormonal contraception, particularly combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives. These agents work by suppressing ovulation and limiting endometrial proliferation, which in turn reduces the amount of endometrial tissue available for prostaglandin synthesis during menstruation.5\n\nWhile effective for a majority of women, these conventional treatments have notable limitations. It is estimated that 20% to 25% of women with PD do not achieve adequate pain relief with NSAIDs or hormonal contraceptives.7 Furthermore, these medications may be contraindicated for certain individuals or may produce undesirable side effects. NSAIDs are associated with a risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as dyspepsia and ulceration, as well as renal and cardiovascular effects with long-term use.7 Hormonal contraceptives carry their own profile of potential side effects, including mood changes, weight gain, and an increased risk of thromboembolic events, making them unsuitable or undesirable for some women.5\n\nThese limitations create a significant therapeutic gap, prompting many women to seek non-pharmacological and complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. Evidence supports the use of some non-pharmacological aids, including topical heat application and exercise.3 Among CAM options, herbal remedies are particularly popular, perceived by many as a safer, more natural approach to managing menstrual pain.8 This widespread use underscores the urgent need for rigorous scientific evaluation of promising herbal interventions to establish their efficacy and safety.\n\n### **1.3 Pharmacological Rationale for Investigational Interventions**\n\nThe selection of matcha and chamomile for this trial is based on substantial preclinical evidence demonstrating their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, which align directly with the known pathophysiology of PD.\n\n#### **1.3.1 Anti-inflammatory and Analgesic Mechanisms of *Camellia sinensis* (Matcha)**\n\nMatcha is a unique preparation of green tea (*Camellia sinensis*) in which the entire tea leaf is stone-ground into a fine powder and consumed as a suspension, rather than an infusion. This method of consumption delivers a much higher concentration of bioactive compounds, particularly catechins, compared to conventional steeped green tea.10 The most abundant and potent of these catechins is epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).11\n\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of EGCG are well-documented. A primary mechanism of action is its ability to attenuate the activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a pivotal transcription factor that orchestrates the inflammatory response.11 By inhibiting NF-κB, EGCG can suppress the gene expression of numerous pro-inflammatory mediators, including COX-2, the inducible enzyme responsible for prostaglandin synthesis at sites of inflammation, as well as inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-1β.11 Furthermore, EGCG is a powerful antioxidant, capable of scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contribute to cellular damage and perpetuate the inflammatory cycle.11 This dual action—targeting a central inflammatory signaling pathway and reducing oxidative stress—positions matcha as a strong candidate for mitigating the systemic and local inflammation that characterizes PD.\n\n#### **1.3.2 Anti-inflammatory and Antispasmodic Mechanisms of *Matricaria recutita* (Chamomile)**\n\nChamomile (*Matricaria recutita* or German chamomile) has a long history of use in traditional medicine as an anti-inflammatory, mild sedative, and treatment for muscle spasms and menstrual disorders.12 Its therapeutic profile is largely attributed to a rich composition of flavonoids, such as apigenin, and volatile oils, including α-bisabolol and chamazulene.12\n\nMechanistic studies have elucidated several pathways relevant to dysmenorrhea. Chamomile extracts have been shown to directly inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin E2 release and selectively attenuate the activity of the COX-2 enzyme, mirroring the primary action of NSAIDs.12 This provides a direct mechanism for reducing the uterine prostaglandin levels that drive menstrual pain. In addition to its anti-inflammatory effects, chamomile possesses notable antispasmodic properties.15 The flavonoid apigenin is believed to contribute to this effect, potentially by acting as a muscle relaxant.16 This action is highly relevant to PD, as it could directly alleviate the intense myometrial contractions that cause cramping and uterine ischemia. Furthermore, chamomile is known to increase urinary levels of glycine, an amino acid that acts as a nerve relaxant and helps relieve muscle spasms.15\n\nThe distinct yet complementary mechanisms of these two botanicals provide a strong rationale for their concurrent investigation. While chamomile appears to act more directly on the prostaglandin synthesis pathway and uterine muscle contractility, matcha targets broader, upstream inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress. Evaluating both in a single, three-arm trial allows for an efficient comparison of two mechanistically distinct, plausible phytotherapeutic strategies against a common placebo control.\n\n### **1.4 Summary of Existing Clinical Evidence and Justification for the Present Trial**\n\nDespite the widespread use of herbal remedies for PD, the clinical evidence base remains weak and inconclusive. A 2016 Cochrane systematic review, a benchmark for evidence-based medicine, evaluated 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of various dietary supplements for dysmenorrhea.18 The authors concluded that there was no high-quality evidence to support the effectiveness of any supplement, including herbal medicines, and that the overall quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons.18 Other systematic reviews have echoed these findings, consistently identifying significant methodological limitations in the existing literature.8\n\nThe primary research gaps identified in these reviews include:\n\n1. **Small Sample Sizes:** Most trials are underpowered, leading to imprecise effect estimates and a high risk of Type II errors (failing to detect a true effect).18  \n2. **Inadequate Blinding:** Many studies lack adequate blinding of participants and investigators, particularly due to the challenge of creating a convincing placebo for interventions with distinct sensory profiles like herbal teas.18  \n3. **Lack of Transparency:** A significant number of studies fail to report their methods in sufficient detail, making it impossible to assess their quality or risk of bias.18  \n4. **Poor Safety Reporting:** The collection and reporting of adverse events are often inadequate, leaving the safety profile of many interventions poorly characterized.18\n\nSpecifically for the interventions in this trial, the evidence is sparse. The Cochrane review noted that data on chamomile versus placebo were unsuitable for meta-analysis due to reporting issues in the original study, and found only very limited evidence from a single RCT suggesting chamomile might be more effective than mefenamic acid.18 For matcha, there is a near-complete absence of rigorous clinical trial data for the indication of primary dysmenorrhea.\n\nThis trial is therefore designed to directly address these long-standing methodological shortcomings. By employing a rigorous, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm parallel-group design, this study will provide a robust evaluation of both matcha and chamomile. Key features designed to overcome previous limitations include a formal power calculation to ensure an adequate sample size, the development and use of a sophisticated sensory-matched placebo to maintain blinding, validated and reliable outcome measures, and a pre-specified statistical analysis plan. This trial aims to generate high-quality evidence to inform clinical practice and provide women suffering from PD with reliable information on the potential efficacy and safety of these widely used herbal teas.\n\n## **2.0 Study Objectives and Hypotheses**\n\nThis section specifies the scientific questions and testable hypotheses that the trial is designed to address.21\n\n### **2.1 Primary Objective**\n\nThe primary objectives of this study are:\n\n* To evaluate the efficacy of daily consumption of matcha tea versus a sensory-matched placebo tea in reducing the severity of menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea.  \n* To evaluate the efficacy of daily consumption of chamomile tea versus a sensory-matched placebo tea in reducing the severity of menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea.\n\n### **2.2 Secondary Objectives**\n\nThe secondary objectives of this study are:\n\n* To compare the effects of matcha tea and chamomile tea versus placebo on menstruation-related quality of life.  \n* To evaluate the effects of matcha tea and chamomile tea versus placebo on the use of rescue analgesic medication for menstrual pain.  \n* To assess the impact of matcha tea and chamomile tea versus placebo on absenteeism from work or school due to menstrual symptoms.  \n* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of daily matcha and chamomile tea consumption over a period of three consecutive menstrual cycles.\n\n### **2.3 Exploratory Objectives**\n\nThe exploratory objectives of this study are:\n\n* To compare the efficacy of matcha tea directly against chamomile tea in reducing menstrual pain severity.  \n* To explore the effects of the interventions on specific symptom clusters associated with dysmenorrhea, including gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, diarrhea) and psychological symptoms (e.g., anxiety, irritability), as measured by subscales of the validated outcome questionnaires.3  \n* To assess the potential moderating effect of baseline expectation of treatment efficacy on pain outcomes across the three study arms.23\n\n### **2.4 Study Hypotheses**\n\nThe following hypotheses will be tested:\n\n* **Primary Hypothesis 1 (H1​):** Participants randomized to the matcha tea group will demonstrate a statistically significant greater mean reduction from baseline in the maximum daily pain intensity score, as measured by a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS), during the first 72 hours of menstruation, averaged over three treatment cycles, compared to participants randomized to the placebo group.  \n* **Primary Hypothesis 2 (H2​):** Participants randomized to the chamomile tea group will demonstrate a statistically significant greater mean reduction from baseline in the maximum daily pain intensity score, as measured by a 100-mm VAS, during the first 72 hours of menstruation, averaged over three treatment cycles, compared to participants randomized to the placebo group.  \n* **Secondary Hypothesis 3 (H3​):** Participants in the matcha and chamomile groups will report a statistically significant greater improvement in menstruation-related quality of life, as measured by the total score of the Menstruation-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (M-QOL-22), compared to the placebo group at the end of the three-month treatment period.  \n* **Secondary Hypothesis 4 (H4​):** Participants in the matcha and chamomile groups will use a statistically significant lower total amount of rescue analgesic medication (ibuprofen 400mg tablets) during the three-month treatment period compared to the placebo group.\n\n## **3.0 Trial Design and Methodology**\n\n### **3.1 Overall Study Design**\n\nThis study is a Phase II/III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, parallel-group superiority trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of matcha tea and chamomile tea in women with primary dysmenorrhea.24\n\nEligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to one of three treatment arms:\n\n1. **Arm A:** Matcha Tea  \n2. **Arm B:** Chamomile Tea  \n3. **Arm C:** Placebo Tea\n\nThe study will involve a 1-month screening and baseline data collection period, during which participants will record pain scores for one full menstrual cycle to establish baseline severity. This will be followed by a 3-month treatment period, corresponding to three consecutive menstrual cycles, during which participants will consume their assigned study product daily. A final 1-month follow-up period will assess any persistent effects after treatment cessation. The total duration of participation for each subject will be approximately 5 months.26 The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and the CONSORT 2010 statement and its extension for herbal interventions.27\n\n### **3.2 Study Population**\n\nThe study will enroll women of reproductive age who meet the established clinical criteria for primary dysmenorrhea. The specific eligibility criteria are detailed in Table 3.1. This precise definition of the target population is essential to ensure the internal validity of the study and to clearly define the population to which the results can be generalized.29\n\n**Table 3.1: Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria**\n\n| Inclusion Criteria | Exclusion Criteria |\n| :---- | :---- |\n| 1\\.

At this visit, a trained study coordinator will conduct the informed consent process. After written consent is obtained, the coordinator will collect detailed medical, gynecological, and menstrual histories, and confirm all eligibility criteria.  \n3. **Baseline Period:** Eligible participants will be provided with access to a smartphone-based electronic diary (e-diary) application. They will be instructed to prospectively record the intensity of their menstrual pain and any use of analgesic medication for one full menstrual cycle. This baseline cycle serves to confirm the required pain severity and to familiarize the participant with the data collection tools.  \n4. **Enrollment and Randomization (Visit 2):** Participants who remain eligible and demonstrate adequate compliance with the e-diary during the baseline cycle will be formally enrolled in the study. This visit will be scheduled to occur within the first 3 days of their next menstrual cycle. At this visit, participants will be randomized to a treatment arm and will receive their first supply of the study product.\n\n### **3.4 Randomization and Blinding Procedures**\n\nTo minimize bias, the trial will employ robust randomization and blinding methods.\n\n* **Randomization and Allocation Concealment:** A biostatistician independent of the study team will generate the master randomization sequence using a validated computer algorithm. The sequence will employ a permuted block randomization design with variable block sizes of 3 and 6, stratified by clinical site, to ensure balanced allocation (1:1:1) across the three arms throughout the recruitment period.38 This allocation sequence will be uploaded to a secure, centralized, 24/7 automated interactive web response system (IWRS). After a participant is confirmed eligible for enrollment, the site coordinator will enter the participant's ID and stratification information into the IWRS, which will then reveal the unique kit number to be dispensed. This method ensures that site personnel are unable to predict or influence the next treatment assignment, thereby maintaining allocation concealment.  \n* **Blinding:** This is a double-blind trial. All participants, investigators, study coordinators, outcome assessors, and data analysts will remain blinded to the treatment assignments until the database is locked at the end of the study. The integrity of the blinding is paramount, especially for an intervention with a distinct sensory profile like tea. The success of blinding hinges on the development of a placebo that is indistinguishable from the active interventions.40 If participants can discern that they are receiving a placebo, their expectations could heavily influence their subjective pain reports, compromising the trial's internal validity.42\n\nTo achieve and maintain effective blinding, the following measures will be implemented:\n\n1. **Sensory-Matched Placebo:** A sophisticated placebo has been developed to mimic the key organoleptic properties of both matcha and chamomile tea. The placebo consists of a pharmacologically inert herbal base (finely milled linden flower), chosen for its mild flavor and lack of known effects on dysmenorrhea. Food-grade, natural colorants (e.g., chlorophyllin, beta-carotene) and non-active flavor compounds are added to replicate the characteristic appearance, aroma, and taste of the active teas.40 An inert excipient (microcrystalline cellulose) is included to match the texture and mouthfeel.45 This multi-component approach ensures that the placebo provides a sensory experience as similar as possible to the active products, making it difficult for participants to guess their assignment.41  \n2. **Identical Packaging:** All three study products (Matcha, Chamomile, Placebo) will be packaged in identical, opaque, individually sealed sachets. These sachets will be placed in coded boxes, labeled only with the study protocol number, participant ID, and the kit number assigned by the IWRS.  \n3. **Blinding Assessment:** At the final study visit, both the participant and the primary site investigator will be asked to guess the participant's treatment allocation (Matcha, Chamomile, Placebo, or \"Don't Know\"). The results of this assessment will be analyzed to formally evaluate the success of the blinding procedures.\n\n### **3.5 Study Interventions**\n\n#### **3.5.1 Investigational Product 1: Matcha Tea (*Camellia sinensis*)**\n\n* **Source and Standardization:** The matcha will be a high-quality, certified organic, ceremonial-grade powder sourced from a single supplier to ensure consistency. Each batch will be accompanied by a certificate of analysis verifying its purity and potency, standardized to contain a minimum of 50 mg of EGCG per 2-gram serving.  \n* **Dosage and Formulation:** The product will be supplied in sachets, each containing 2 grams of matcha powder. Participants will be instructed to consume one sachet twice daily, for a total daily dose of 4 grams.10 This dose is selected based on studies suggesting it is both safe and effective for eliciting physiological effects.10\n\n#### **3.5.2 Investigational Product 2: Chamomile Tea (*Matricaria recutita*)**\n\n* **Source and Standardization:** The chamomile will be high-quality, certified organic German chamomile (*Matricaria recutita*) whole dried flowers, sourced from a single supplier. Each batch will be standardized to contain a minimum of 1.2% apigenin by weight.  \n* **Dosage and Formulation:** The product will be supplied in tea bag-style sachets, each containing 2.5 grams of dried chamomile flowers. Participants will be instructed to consume one sachet twice daily, for a total daily dose of 5 grams. This dosage is consistent with traditional use and previous clinical studies.15\n\n#### **3.5.3 Placebo Control: Sensory-Matched Herbal Infusion**\n\n* **Composition:** Each placebo sachet will contain a blend of pharmacologically inert ingredients, including linden flower powder, microcrystalline cellulose, and food-grade natural colorants and flavorings, as described in Section 3.4.40 The composition is designed to be free of any known analgesic, anti-inflammatory, or antispasmodic activity.\n\n#### **3.5.4 Dosing, Preparation, and Administration**\n\nParticipants in all three arms will receive identical instructions. They will be directed to consume one sachet in the morning and one in the evening, every day, for the entire 3-month treatment period. They will be instructed to prepare the beverage by adding the contents of one sachet to 8 ounces (approximately 240 mL) of hot water (approximately 80°C or 175°F) and allowing it to steep or dissolve for 5 minutes before consumption.36 To standardize the preparation method, all participants will be provided with a digital kitchen thermometer. Consumption of the study product will be recorded daily in the e-diary to monitor adherence.\n\n#### **3.5.5 Concomitant Medications and Rescue Therapy**\n\nThroughout the study, participants are prohibited from using any other prescription or over-the-counter analgesics (other than the provided rescue medication), anti-inflammatory drugs, antispasmodics, or herbal remedies intended for the treatment of menstrual pain.\n\nFor the management of severe menstrual pain that is not adequately controlled by the study intervention, participants will be permitted to use ibuprofen 400 mg as a rescue medication. They will be provided with a supply of ibuprofen and instructed that they may take one tablet as needed for severe pain, up to a maximum of three tablets (1200 mg) in any 24-hour period. The date, time, and dosage of every instance of rescue medication use must be meticulously recorded in the e-diary. This serves as a critical secondary endpoint for assessing the efficacy of the interventions.24\n\n### **3.6 Study Procedures and Schedule of Assessments**\n\nAll study procedures and assessments will be conducted according to the schedule outlined in Table 3.2. This schedule provides an operational roadmap for the trial, ensuring consistency and completeness of data collection across all participants and sites.\n\n**Table 3.2: Schedule of Assessments**\n\n| Procedure / Assessment | Screening (Visit 1, Day \\-35 to \\-5) | Baseline (Visit 2, Cycle 1 Day 1-3) | Treatment Period (Cycles 1-3) | End of Treatment (Visit 3, Cycle 3 Day 28\\) | Follow-up (Visit 4, Cycle 4 Day 28\\) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Informed Consent** | X |  |  |  |  |\n| **Eligibility Verification** | X |  |  |  |  |\n| **Demographics & Medical History** | X |  |  |  |  |\n| **Randomization & Enrollment** |  | X |  |  |  |\n| **Dispense Study Product** |  | X (Cycle 1\\) |  | X (Cycles 2 & 3 dispensed at prior visit) |  |\n| **Daily e-Diary (Pain VAS, Rescue Meds)** | X (Baseline Cycle) |  | X (Daily during menses) |  |  |\n| **Quality of Life (M-QOL-22)** | X |  | End of each menstrual cycle | X | X |\n| **Dysmenorrhea Symptom Interference (DSI)** | X |  | End of each menstrual cycle | X | X |\n| **Absenteeism Log** |  |  | End of each menstrual cycle |  |  |\n| **Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring** |  | X | Ongoing (phone/e-diary) | X | X |\n| **Compliance Check (Sachet Count)** |  |  |  | X |  |\n| **Blinding Assessment** |  |  |  | X |  |\n\n## **4.0 Outcome Measures and Data Collection**\n\n### **4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint**\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint is the **change from baseline in the mean of the maximum daily pain intensity scores during the first 72 hours of menstruation, averaged over the three treatment cycles.**\n\n* **Instrument:** This will be measured using a 100-millimeter (mm) horizontal Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is anchored with \"no pain\" at 0 mm and \"worst imaginable pain\" at 100 mm.35 The VAS is a well-validated, sensitive, and reliable instrument for quantifying subjective pain intensity in clinical trials. Participants will record their maximum pain level experienced each day for the first 3 days of their period using the e-diary. The baseline value will be the average of the maximum daily scores from the baseline cycle. The endpoint value will be the average of the mean maximum daily scores across the three treatment cycles.\n\n### **4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints**\n\nSecondary endpoints are designed to provide a broader assessment of the interventions' clinical benefits.\n\n* **Menstruation-Related Quality of Life:** The change from baseline to the end of the 3-month treatment period in the total score of the **Menstruation-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (M-QOL-22)**.53 The M-QOL-22 is a validated, 22-item instrument specifically designed to assess the impact of menstrual pain on QoL, covering domains of health perception, psychological well-being, and physical symptoms.  \n* **Symptom Interference:** The change from baseline to the end of the 3-month treatment period in the total score of the **Dysmenorrhea Symptom Interference (DSI) scale**.54 The DSI is a validated 9-item scale that measures the extent to which menstrual symptoms interfere with daily physical, mental, and social activities.  \n* **Rescue Medication Use:** The total number of ibuprofen 400 mg tablets consumed for menstrual pain during the 3-month treatment period, as recorded in the e-diary.  \n* **Absenteeism:** The total number of full or partial days of work or school missed due to menstrual symptoms during the 3-month treatment period, as recorded in the e-diary at the end of each cycle.  \n* **Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC):** At the end of the treatment period (Visit 3), participants will rate their overall change in menstrual symptoms since starting the trial on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from \"very much improved\" to \"very much worse.\"\n\n### **4.3 Exploratory Endpoints**\n\n* Change from baseline in the specific subscale scores of the M-QOL-22 (health perception, psychological aspects, symptoms) and the DSI scale to explore effects on different symptom domains.  \n* The correlation between participants' baseline expectation of treatment efficacy (measured on a 0-10 scale at Visit 2\\) and the primary outcome, to assess the potential influence of the placebo effect.\n\n### **4.4 Safety and Tolerability Assessments**\n\nSafety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the trial.\n\n* All adverse events (AEs), whether spontaneously reported by the participant or elicited by study staff questioning, will be recorded from the time of randomization until the final follow-up visit.  \n* AEs will be documented in the eCRF, including a description of the event, onset and resolution dates, severity (mild, moderate, severe), and the investigator's assessment of its relationship to the study product (not related, possibly related, definitely related).56  \n* All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  \n* Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be subject to expedited reporting procedures as detailed in Section 6.4.\n\n### **4.5 Data Collection Instruments and Procedures**\n\nTo ensure high-quality data, standardized and validated instruments will be used.\n\n* **Electronic Diaries (e-diaries):** A validated, 21 CFR Part 11-compliant smartphone application will be used for daily data collection during menstruation. This method is chosen to minimize recall bias, improve data accuracy, and enhance participant compliance compared to paper diaries. The e-diary will prompt participants to enter their VAS pain score and any rescue medication use each evening.  \n* **Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs):** All other study data, including demographics, medical history, eligibility confirmation, randomization details, questionnaire responses collected at clinic visits, and AE information, will be entered directly into a secure, web-based eCRF system (e.g., REDCap). Access to the system will be password-protected and restricted to authorized study personnel.\n\n### **4.6 Data Management and Quality Assurance**\n\nA comprehensive Data Management Plan (DMP) will be developed prior to study start, outlining all procedures for data handling, from collection to database lock.\n\n* **Data Entry and Validation:** Data from questionnaires will be entered into the eCRF at the clinical sites. The eCRF will have built-in logic checks and range checks to minimize data entry errors.  \n* **Data Review:** The central data management team will perform regular remote monitoring of the data for completeness, consistency, and adherence to the protocol. Data queries will be generated and resolved with the clinical sites in a timely manner.  \n* **Source Data Verification (SDV):** An independent clinical monitor will conduct periodic site visits to perform SDV on a random subset (e.g., 10%) of participant data, comparing the source documents (e.g., medical records) with the entries in the eCRF to ensure accuracy and integrity.  \n* **Database Lock:** The database will be locked only after all data have been entered, all queries have been resolved, and the Principal Investigator and biostatistician have signed off on the data quality.\n\n## **5.0 Statistical Considerations**\n\nThis section details the pre-specified statistical methods that will be used to analyze the trial data, ensuring an objective and rigorous evaluation of the study's objectives.\n\n### **5.1 Sample Size and Power Calculation**\n\nThe sample size for this trial is calculated to provide adequate statistical power to detect a clinically meaningful difference in pain reduction between each of the two active intervention groups (Matcha and Chamomile) and the placebo group for the primary endpoint.\n\n* **Assumptions:** Based on a review of similar trials evaluating non-pharmacological interventions for PD, a clinically meaningful difference in pain reduction on a 100-mm VAS is estimated to be 20 mm.24 The standard deviation (SD) of the change in VAS score is conservatively estimated to be 25 mm.  \n* **Calculation:** The study involves two primary hypotheses: (1) Matcha vs. Placebo and (2) Chamomile vs. Placebo. To control the overall study-wise Type I error rate at 5%, an adjustment for multiple comparisons is necessary.58 A Bonferroni correction will be applied, which is a conservative approach that ensures robust control of false-positive findings.61 Therefore, the significance level (α) for each of the two primary comparisons will be set at 0.05 / 2 \\= 0.025 (two-sided). The desired statistical power (1-β) is set at 90%.  \n  Using the standard formula for the comparison of two means 62:\n\n  n=f(α/2,β)×2×σ2/(μ1​−μ2​)2  \n  where n is the sample size per group, σ is the standard deviation (25), (μ1​−μ2​) is the mean difference (20), and f(α/2,β) for α=0.025 and β=0.10 is 10.5.  \n  n=10.5×2×(252)/(202)=10.5×2×625/400=32.8  \n  A more precise calculation using statistical software yields a required sample size of **83 participants per group**.  \n* **Adjustment for Dropout:** To account for a potential participant dropout rate of 20% over the 5-month study duration, the sample size will be inflated.64 The adjusted sample size per group is calculated as:  \n  83/(1−0.20)=103.75. This will be rounded up to **104 participants per group**.  \n* **Total Sample Size:** The total number of participants to be randomized will be 104 participants/group × 3 groups \\= **312 participants**.\n\n### **5.2 Definition of Analysis Populations**\n\nAnalyses will be conducted on the following pre-defined populations:\n\n* **Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Population:** This population will include all participants who are randomized, regardless of their adherence to the study protocol, the amount of study product consumed, or whether they completed the study. Participants will be analyzed in the group to which they were originally assigned. The ITT principle is the gold standard for analyzing RCTs as it preserves the benefits of randomization and minimizes bias. This will be the primary population for all efficacy analyses.7  \n* **Per-Protocol (PP) Population:** This will be a subset of the ITT population, including only those participants who are deemed to have been adequately compliant with the protocol. Compliance will be defined as consuming at least 80% of the assigned study product and having no major protocol violations (e.g., use of prohibited medications, failure to complete primary outcome assessments). Analyses on the PP population will be conducted as sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the primary findings.  \n* **Safety Population:** This population will include all randomized participants who consumed at least one dose of the assigned study product. All safety and tolerability analyses will be performed on this population.\n\n### **5.3 Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)**\n\nA comprehensive SAP will be developed and finalized by the study biostatistician before database lock and unblinding.66 The SAP will provide detailed descriptions of all planned analyses. The key analytical approaches are summarized below.\n\n#### **5.3.1 Primary Endpoint Analysis**\n\nThe primary efficacy analysis will compare the change from baseline in the mean of the maximum daily VAS pain scores between each active group and the placebo group. The analysis will be performed on the ITT population using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOMA) model. The model will be specified as follows:\n\n* **Dependent Variable:** Change from baseline in the mean maximum VAS score (averaged over 3 treatment cycles).  \n* **Main Factor:** Treatment group (3 levels: Matcha, Chamomile, Placebo).  \n* Covariates: Baseline VAS score and study center.  \n  The primary comparisons of interest (Matcha vs. Placebo and Chamomile vs. Placebo) will be assessed using contrasts within this model.\n\n#### **5.3.2 Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint Analyses**\n\n* **Continuous Secondary Outcomes:** Changes from baseline in the M-QOL-22 and DSI total scores will be analyzed using a similar ANCOMA model as the primary endpoint. A mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) may also be used as a sensitivity analysis to incorporate data from all three treatment cycles and account for the correlation of measurements within participants over time.67  \n* **Count-Based Secondary Outcomes:** The total number of rescue medication tablets used and the number of days of absenteeism will be compared between groups using Poisson regression or Negative Binomial regression models, which are appropriate for count data. These models will be adjusted for baseline pain severity and study center.  \n* **Categorical Outcomes:** The PGIC will be analyzed by comparing the distribution of responses across the three groups using a chi-squared test or ordinal logistic regression.  \n* **Exploratory Analyses:** The direct comparison between the Matcha and Chamomile groups will be conducted using the same ANCOMA model as the primary analysis. However, as the study is not powered for this comparison, the results will be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating.\n\n#### **5.3.3 Adjustments for Multiple Comparisons**\n\nTo control the family-wise error rate for the two primary hypotheses, a hierarchical testing procedure will be employed. First, the comparison of Matcha vs. Placebo will be tested at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. If this comparison is statistically significant (p\\<0.05), the comparison of Chamomile vs. Placebo will then be tested at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. This gatekeeping strategy controls the overall Type I error rate at 5% and is generally more powerful than the Bonferroni correction used for the sample size calculation. No adjustments for multiplicity will be made for secondary or exploratory analyses; these will be interpreted with caution.\n\n#### **5.3.4 Handling of Missing Data**\n\nThe primary analysis will be conducted on the ITT population. Every effort will be made to minimize missing data. For the primary ANCOMA analysis, missing post-baseline data will be handled using multiple imputation under the assumption of missing at random (MAR).66 A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the PP population (complete case analysis) to assess the robustness of the results. Additional sensitivity analyses may be conducted to explore the impact of different assumptions about the missing data mechanism.\n\n#### **5.3.5 Interim Analyses**\n\nNo formal interim analyses for efficacy or futility are planned for this study. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review unblinded safety data at pre-specified intervals (see Section 6.5).\n\n#### **5.3.6 Safety Data Analysis**\n\nAll safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population. The incidence of all AEs, treatment-emergent AEs, and SAEs will be summarized descriptively by treatment group, severity, and relationship to the study product. Data will be presented in summary tables. No formal statistical hypothesis testing will be performed on safety data.\n\n## **6.0 Ethical and Regulatory Compliance**\n\nThis clinical trial will be conducted in strict adherence to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and all applicable national and local regulations.\n\n### **6.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval**\n\nThe study protocol, the informed consent form, all recruitment materials, participant-facing documents, and any subsequent amendments will be submitted to a central Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval prior to the initiation of any study-related activities.69 The trial will not commence until written approval from the IRB has been obtained. The IRB will be responsible for the ongoing review of the study at least annually.\n\n### **6.2 Informed Consent Process**\n\nObtaining informed consent is a critical ethical requirement and will be treated as an ongoing process of communication, not merely a one-time event of signing a form.70\n\n* **Procedure:** A trained and qualified member of the study team will present all aspects of the study to each potential participant in a private setting, using language that is clear and understandable. The explanation will cover the study's purpose, procedures, duration, potential risks and benefits, alternatives to participation, confidentiality measures, and the voluntary nature of participation.69  \n* **Decision Time:** Participants will be given ample opportunity to ask questions and will be encouraged to discuss their potential participation with family, friends, or their personal physician before making a decision.72  \n* **Documentation:** All participants must provide written, signed, and dated informed consent before any study-specific procedures are performed. The participant will receive a signed copy of the consent form for their records, and the original will be retained in the study's regulatory files.71 The consent form will explicitly state the risks associated with herbal products, including the caffeine content in matcha, the potential for allergic reactions to chamomile, and the possibility of unknown interactions with other medications or supplements.73\n\n### **6.3 Participant Confidentiality and Data Protection**\n\nThe privacy and confidentiality of all participants will be protected throughout the study.\n\n* **Anonymization:** Participants will be assigned a unique, non-identifying code upon enrollment. All study data, including eCRFs, e-diaries, and any biological samples, will be identified only by this code.  \n* **Data Security:** All electronic data will be stored on secure, password-protected, encrypted servers with limited access. Physical documents containing personal identifiers will be stored in locked cabinets in secure offices.  \n* **Reporting:** In any publications or presentations of the study results, data will be presented in an aggregated and anonymized format to preclude the identification of individual participants.\n\n### **6.4 Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring, Documentation, and Reporting**\n\nThe safety of participants is the highest priority. A robust system for monitoring, documenting, and reporting adverse events will be in place.\n\n* **Definitions:** Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be defined in accordance with ICH-GCP guidelines and NIA recommendations.56 An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An SAE is any AE that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization, results in persistent disability, or is a congenital anomaly.56  \n* **Investigator Responsibilities:** The site investigator is responsible for documenting all AEs and SAEs, assessing their severity, and determining their potential relationship to the study product. This information will be recorded in the participant's eCRF.74  \n* **Reporting Timelines:** All SAEs must be reported to the sponsor and the central IRB within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others (UPIRSOs) will also be reported promptly to the IRB and sponsor according to institutional and regulatory requirements.56\n\n### **6.5 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)**\n\nTo ensure the ongoing safety of participants and the integrity of the trial data, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established.\n\n* **Composition:** The DSMB will be composed of at least three independent experts with relevant expertise, including a gynecologist with experience in dysmenorrhea, a biostatistician, and a clinical pharmacologist or phytotherapy expert. None of the members will be otherwise involved in the trial.  \n* **Responsibilities:** The DSMB will operate under a formal charter that outlines its roles, responsibilities, and procedures. Its primary responsibility is to periodically review cumulative, unblinded safety data to monitor for any emerging safety concerns. The DSMB will review data after 25%, 50%, and 75% of participants have completed the treatment period.  \n* **Authority:** The DSMB will have the authority to recommend to the sponsor that the study be modified, suspended, or terminated if there are concerns about participant safety or if the study's scientific integrity has been compromised.\n\n### **6.6 Trial Registration and Dissemination of Findings**\n\n* **Trial Registration:** In the interest of transparency, this trial will be registered on a public clinical trials registry (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) before the enrollment of the first participant.77  \n* **Dissemination Policy:** The results of this trial will be submitted for publication in a high-impact, peer-reviewed medical journal, regardless of the final outcome. The manuscript will be prepared in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 statement and its specific extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions to ensure complete and transparent reporting.27 The findings will also be presented at national and international scientific conferences to ensure wide dissemination to the medical and research communities.\n\n## **7.0 Appendices**\n\n### **7.1 Appendix A: Sample Informed Consent Form**\n\n(A full informed consent document, based on the NIA template 73 and customized for this trial, would be included here.)\n\n### **7.2 Appendix B: Validated Assessment Questionnaires**\n\n*(Copies of the Visual Analog Scale, Menstruation-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (M-QOL-22), and Dysmenorrhea Symptom Interference (DSI) Scale would be included here.)*\n\n### **7.3 Appendix C: Sample Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) Screens**\n\n*(Examples of key eCRF screens for demographics, AE reporting, and primary outcome data entry would be included here.)*\n\n### **7.4 Appendix D: Adverse Event Reporting Form**\n\n*(A standardized form for documenting and reporting adverse events would be included here.)*\n",
