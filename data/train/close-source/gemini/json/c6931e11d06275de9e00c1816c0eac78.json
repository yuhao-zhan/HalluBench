      "description": "I'm starting my research by addressing a potential misunderstanding in the initial query. The user mentioned 'EVE: Void,' which doesn't appear to be a known EVE Online expansion. I'm proceeding with the assumption that the user is referring to 'EVE Online' and is interested in making money by scanning and hacking data sites. I'll also need to clarify what 'Zero Data Cores' and 'videos' refer to, as these aren't standard terms in EVE Online's loot categories. It's possible they are player-coined terms or refer to specific valuable items within data sites.\nMy plan is to first understand the relevant terminology and types of sites where valuable items are found. Then, I'll delve into the necessary skills, ships, and modules for effective scanning and hacking. I'll also outline the step-by-step process of exploration, identify where these sites are commonly located, and research the typical loot and their market values to determine profitability. Finally, I'll consider the risks involved and compare data site exploration with relic site exploration for a broader perspective.\nI'm beginning with a broad search to gain a comprehensive understanding of data site exploration in EVE Online and to specifically identify what the user might mean by 'Zero Data Cores' and 'videos'."

    "observation_1": "I've started by gathering information on data and relic sites in EVE Online. It appears that 'Zero Data Cores' and 'videos' are not standard in-game terms for loot. Data sites primarily contain decryptors, data cores, skill books, and blueprint copies, while relic sites offer salvage materials, skill books, and blueprint copies. The value of loot can vary significantly, with some sites yielding over 20 million ISK and others much less. Nullsec and wormhole space generally offer more lucrative sites, with Sansha and Gurista relic sites being particularly valuable. I've also learned that 'Ghost Sites' are a distinct type of data site with unique mechanics and potentially very high-value loot, including implant blueprint copies worth billions.",

Pirate data and relic sites are found in normal space and C1-C3 wormholes, while Sleeper sites are in wormholes and often involve combat. Ghost sites are a high-risk, high-reward type of data site found in all security spaces, with a hidden timer and explosive containers. The value of loot is influenced by the security status of the space (nullsec and wormholes generally being more profitable) and the specific faction of the site. I've also noted that data cores are used in the invention process for Tech II items and can be obtained from data sites, R&D agents, or Factional Warfare LP stores.\nTo further understand the specifics of data site exploration and the potential for profit, I'm now going to delve deeper into the EVE University Wiki. I'll be focusing on the detailed loot tables for data and ghost sites, the mechanics of ghost sites including their explosion damage and NPC spawns, and a more comprehensive understanding of data core types, their uses, and market value. This will help me to provide a more precise answer regarding making money from these activities and to clarify the user's initial query about 'Zero Data Cores' and 'videos'."

  "final_report": "# **The Explorer's Atlas to Wealth Generation in New Eden**\n\n## **Section 1: The Cartographer's Toolkit - Foundational Preparations for the Aspiring Explorer**\n\nEmbarking on a career as an explorer in New Eden is to choose a path of solitude, discovery, and immense potential profit. It is a profession that rewards preparation, patience, and a keen understanding of the tools of the trade. For the capsuleer willing to venture into the unknown, the universe is filled with forgotten relics of past conflicts and unsecured data vaults ripe for the taking. This section serves as the foundational briefing, equipping the aspiring explorer with the essential knowledge of ships, skills, and equipment required to not only find these hidden treasures but to survive the journey.\n\n### **1.1. A Note on Terminology: Decoding the Language of New Eden**\n\nBefore a capsuleer can navigate the complexities of space, they must first master its language. The universe is known as *EVE Online*, a vast and persistent galaxy called New Eden. The lucrative targets of an explorer are not abstract concepts like \"Zero Data Cores\" or \"videos,\" but tangible, high-value assets found within cosmic signatures designated as **Data Sites** and **Relic Sites**.1\n\nThese sites are remnants of past activity, unguarded pockets of space containing hackable containers. The contents of these containers are the source of an explorer's wealth:\n\n* **Data Sites** primarily yield items crucial for advanced industry, known as invention. These include various types of **Datacores**, which are fundamental components for creating Tech II items; **Decryptors**, which modify the invention process; and **Blueprint Copies (BPCs)** for a wide array of modules, rigs, and even ships.1\n* **Relic Sites** contain salvage materials, the technological detritus of destroyed ships and structures. This salvage, particularly Tech II salvage, is essential for manufacturing Rigs—specialized upgrades that enhance a ship's performance.1\n\nUnderstanding this distinction is the first step. The goal is to acquire these specific industrial materials, which are in constant demand by New Eden's manufacturing empires, and transport them to market hubs for sale.\n\n### **1.2. The Explorer's Vessel: A Tiered Analysis of Exploration Frigates**\n\nThe single most important piece of equipment for an explorer is their ship. It is at once a mobile scanning platform, a hacking station, and a life raft in the hostile void. The choice of vessel is not merely a matter of budget but a strategic decision that defines a pilot's capabilities, risk profile, and intended method of operation. The progression path is clear, from inexpensive, disposable frigates to highly advanced, specialized platforms.\n\n#### **Tier 1 (The Entry Point): Tech I Exploration Frigates**\n\nFor the new capsuleer, the journey begins with one of the four racial Tech I exploration frigates. Each is designed with inherent bonuses to scanning and hacking, making them ideal for learning the profession.3 The four ships are:\n\n* **Heron** (Caldari)\n* **Magnate** (Amarr)\n* **Imicus** (Gallente)\n* **Probe** (Minmatar)\n\nWhile all are capable, analysis of their slot layouts reveals a clear superior choice for pilots with developing skills. The **Heron** possesses five mid-slots, a significant advantage over the others. This configuration allows a new pilot to fit both a Data and Relic Analyzer alongside a propulsion module and two crucial scanning upgrade modules (Scan Rangefinding Arrays), maximizing their ability to locate cosmic signatures with low skill levels.5 This makes the Heron the most recommended starting vessel for any aspiring explorer, regardless of their racial specialization.\n\nA typical entry-level fitting for a Heron prioritizes scanning effectiveness and agility for escape over any form of defense:\n\n* **High Slots:** Core Probe Launcher I, Improved Cloaking Device II\n* **Mid Slots:** 5MN Microwarpdrive I, Data Analyzer I, Relic Analyzer I, Scan Rangefinding Array I (x2)\n* **Low Slots:** Nanofiber Internal Structure I (x2)\n* **Rigs:** Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade I (x2)\n* **Cargo:** Core Scanner Probe I (x16)\n\nThis fit is inexpensive and focuses on the core tasks: finding sites and hacking them. The Nanofiber structures decrease align time, making it faster to enter warp and escape danger.\n\n#### **Tier 2 (The Professional Standard): Tech II Covert Ops Frigates**\n\nGraduating to a Tech II Covert Ops frigate marks the transition from a novice to a professional explorer. These ships—the **Anathema** (Amarr), **Buzzard** (Caldari), **Helios** (Gallente), and **Cheetah** (Minmatar)—are defined by one critical piece of technology: the ability to fit a **Covert Ops Cloaking Device**.3\n\nThis advanced cloak allows the ship to warp while remaining invisible, a capability that represents the single greatest survival advantage in dangerous space. A pilot in a Covert Ops frigate can move through hostile systems with near-perfect impunity, scan for sites from a cloaked safe spot, and remain hidden even while approaching a target container.5 Furthermore, these ships can be fitted with an\n\n**Interdiction Nullifier** module, which grants temporary immunity to warp disruption bubbles, the primary tool used by hunters to trap ships in null-security space.5\n\nWithin this class, a long-standing debate exists between the Buzzard and the Helios. The **Buzzard**, like its T1 counterpart, has five mid-slots, allowing for a powerful scanning setup. The **Helios**, however, is significantly more agile and faster, reducing the time it takes to align and warp, which can be the difference between escape and destruction.6 The choice often comes down to pilot preference: maximizing scanning power versus maximizing evasiveness.\n\n#### **Tier 3 (The Elite Choice): Faction & Strategic Cruisers**\n\nAt the apex of exploration vessels are specialized and costly ships that offer capabilities beyond simple hacking.\n\n* **The Astero:** This Sisters of EVE faction frigate is the quintessential predator among explorers. It combines strong scanning and hacking bonuses with a formidable combat capability, thanks to its powerful drone bay.6 An Astero pilot does not merely run from threats; they can become the threat, hunting other explorers or defending themselves against opportunistic attackers. However, this power comes at a significantly higher price tag, making its loss a major financial setback.10\n* **Tech III Cruisers (T3Cs):** Ships like the **Tengu**, **Loki**, and **Proteus** are the pinnacle of versatility. Through their modular subsystem design, they can be configured to excel at exploration while possessing a powerful tank and significant damage output.5 A T3C can use a Covert Ops cloak, achieve interdiction nullification, and carry multiple refits in its cargo hold. This allows a single ship to run standard exploration sites, tank the explosive damage of a Ghost Site, and clear the NPCs from a Sleeper combat site. This flexibility is unmatched, but it comes at an immense cost, with fully fitted T3Cs often exceeding half a billion ISK, representing a substantial risk for any pilot.5\n\nThe progression through these tiers is not just about accumulating wealth; it is about defining one's role in the ecosystem of the void. A Heron pilot is prey, relying on caution. A Buzzard pilot is a ghost, relying on invisibility. An Astero pilot is a hunter, relying on ambush. And a T3C pilot is a survivalist, relying on overwhelming versatility. The new capsuleer should begin with the humble Heron, mastering the fundamentals before investing in the advanced tools and accepting the greater risks that come with them.\n\n| **Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Exploration Frigates** |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Ship** | **Class** | **Primary Bonus** | **Slot Layout (H/M/L)** | **Key Advantage** | **Est. Hull Cost (Jita)** |\n| Heron | T1 Frigate | Scanning & Hacking | 3 / 5 / 3 | 5 mid-slots for superior scanning with low skills. | 1-2 Million ISK |\n| Buzzard | T2 CovOps | Scanning & Hacking | 3 / 5 / 3 | Covert Ops Cloak, 5 mid-slots for scanning arrays. | 30-40 Million ISK |\n| Helios | T2 CovOps | Scanning & Hacking | 3 / 4 / 4 | Covert Ops Cloak, superior agility and speed. | 30-40 Million ISK |\n| Astero | Faction Frigate | Scanning & Hacking | 3 / 4 / 4 | Covert Ops Cloak, powerful combat drone bay. | 100-120 Million ISK |\n\n### **1.3. The Capsuleer's Mind: Essential Skills for Exploration**\n\nA well-fitted ship is useless without a well-trained pilot. Success in exploration is heavily dependent on a specific set of skills that govern every aspect of the profession, from locating sites to cracking them open. Training these skills should be the highest priority for any new explorer.\n\n* **Scanning Skills (The \"Astrometrics\" Trio):** These are the most fundamental skills.\n  + **Astrometrics:** The core skill that improves scan probe strength, reduces scan time, and decreases scan deviation per level.5\n  + **Astrometric Rangefinding:** Provides a significant bonus to scan probe strength, making it easier to get a 100% lock on a signature.5\n  + **Astrometric Pinpointing:** Reduces the maximum scan deviation, making it easier to pinpoint a signature's exact location.11\n  + **Astrometric Acquisition:** Reduces the time it takes for probes to complete a scan cycle.11\n\n    Higher-difficulty sites (rated Level IV and V, such as Sleeper Caches) are often impossible to scan down without high levels in these skills and specialized equipment.1\n* **Hacking Skills:** These skills directly impact the hacking minigame.\n  + **Archaeology:** Governs the hacking of containers in Relic sites. Each level increases the \"virus strength\" of the Relic Analyzer, making it easier to overcome defensive nodes.4\n  + **Hacking:** The counterpart to Archaeology, this skill applies to Data sites and increases the virus strength of the Data Analyzer.4\n* **Support & Survival Skills:** These skills enable the use of critical modules and improve the ship's performance.\n  + **Cloaking:** Required to use cloaking devices. Level IV is necessary for the Tech II Covert Ops Cloaking Device.4\n  + **Navigation Skills:** Skills like Evasive Maneuvering and Spaceship Command improve ship agility and speed, reducing the crucial time it takes to align and enter warp.\n  + **Engineering Skills:** CPU Management and Powergrid Management are essential for fitting all the necessary modules onto the ship's limited framework.\n\n### **1.4. Outfitting for Success: Modules and Rigs**\n\nThe final layer of preparation involves selecting the correct modules to execute the tasks of exploration efficiently and safely.\n\n* **Core Modules:** Every exploration ship requires these basic components.\n  + **Core Probe Launcher:** This high-slot module launches the Core Scanner Probes used to find cosmic signatures.3 Using upgraded\n    Sisters Core Scanner Probes provides a significant boost to scan strength and is a highly recommended first upgrade.1\n  + **Data Analyzer & Relic Analyzer:** These mid-slot modules are used to initiate the hacking minigame on their respective container types.12\n  + **5MN Microwarpdrive (MWD):** A propulsion module essential for quickly traversing the large distances between containers within a site, minimizing time spent vulnerable and uncloaked.3\n* **Advanced Modules:** As a pilot's wealth and skills grow, they can invest in advanced modules that provide significant quality-of-life improvements.\n  + **Integrated Analyzers:** Modules like the **'Ligature' Integrated Analyzer** and the more powerful **'Zeugma' Integrated Analyzer** combine the function of both Data and Relic analyzers into a single mid-slot.8 This frees up a valuable slot for another scanning module or a defensive tool, but they come at a high cost.\n  + **Implants & Boosters:** For the truly dedicated explorer, the **'Blackglass' Cybernetic Subprocessor** implant provides a massive bonus to hacking virus strength. When combined with a Zeugma analyzer, it makes even the most difficult hacking challenges trivial, allowing a pilot to bypass the minigame with overwhelming force.13\n* **Rigs:** These permanent ship modifications are used to specialize a hull's performance. For exploration, the most common choice is the **Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade**, which provides a flat percentage bonus to scan probe strength, further aiding in the hunt for difficult signatures.3\n\nWith a properly chosen ship, a focused skill plan, and the right modules, the capsuleer is prepared to leave the relative safety of known space and begin the hunt.\n\n## **Section 2: Anatomy of a Find - A Taxonomy of Exploration Sites**\n\nNot all cosmic signatures are created equal. The universe of New Eden is dotted with a wide variety of sites, each with its own unique mechanics, risks, and potential rewards. A proficient explorer must learn to identify these sites, understand their internal workings, and assess whether the potential profit justifies the inherent danger. This taxonomy provides a detailed classification of the primary non-combat sites an explorer will encounter.\n\n### **2.1. The Primary Targets: Data vs. Relic Sites**\n\nThe bread and butter of the exploration profession are standard pirate faction Data and Relic sites. These are unguarded locations containing a number of hackable containers scattered around a central landmark.1 While they share a similar structure, their contents and value propositions are distinct.\n\n* **Data Sites:** These sites are the remnants of information hubs, communication relays, and research outposts. Their containers, which resemble gyroscopic structures, hold the building blocks of advanced technology: datacores, decryptors, manufacturing components, and blueprint copies.1\n* **Relic Sites:** These are debris fields, ancient battlefields, and abandoned monuments. Their containers, which look like wrecked ship hulls and damaged structures, contain T1 and T2 salvage materials used in the construction of ship rigs.1\n\nWithin each site, the containers themselves are tiered, indicating both the difficulty of the hack and the potential quality of the loot. A pilot with a cargo scanner can identify the contents of a can before hacking, allowing them to prioritize the most valuable targets. This hierarchy is a crucial piece of operational intelligence.1\n\n* **Relic Container Hierarchy (from lowest to highest value):**\n  1. (Faction) Debris\n  2. (Faction) Rubble\n  3. (Faction) Remains\n  4. (Faction) Ruins\n* **Data Container Hierarchy (from lowest to highest value):**\n  1. (Faction) Info Shard\n  2. (Faction) Com Tower\n  3. (Faction) Mainframe\n  4. (Faction) Databank\n\nSites found in higher-risk space (low-sec, null-sec, and wormholes) will contain a greater proportion of the more difficult and valuable containers, such as Ruins and Databanks.16\n\n### **2.2. Factional Variations: Know Your Enemy, Know Your Loot**\n\nThe loot found within these sites is not uniform; it is directly tied to the pirate faction that once controlled the area. Each of the major pirate factions—Sansha's Nation, Guristas Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, and Serpentis Corporation—has a unique loot table for both their Data and Relic sites.1 For example, Sansha Relic sites are the exclusive source of Intact Armor Plates, while Guristas sites contain Intact Shield Emitters.3 This factional specificity is the cornerstone of strategic exploration; a pilot seeking a particular type of salvage must venture into the regions of space controlled by the corresponding faction. This knowledge transforms exploration from a random search into a targeted hunt.\n\n### **2.3. High-Risk, High-Reward: Ghost Sites**\n\nAmong the most lucrative and dangerous data sites in New Eden are the enigmatic **Ghost Sites**. These appear on the probe scanner as <Faction> Covert Research Facility and represent a high-stakes challenge with a unique set of rules that set them apart from standard exploration sites.17 They are, in essence, a timed heist where failure has explosive consequences.\n\nThe mechanics of a Ghost Site are designed to pressure the explorer into a rapid \"smash and grab\" operation:\n\n* **The Hidden Timer:** Upon warping to the site (if uncloaked), a hidden and randomized timer, typically between two and three minutes, begins to count down. When this timer expires, a powerful fleet of pirate NPCs warps in to defend the facility.17\n* **Explosive Consequences:** The containers in a Ghost Site are booby-trapped. A single failed hack attempt will cause all containers in the site to instantly detonate. This explosion also occurs if the hidden timer runs out and the defending NPCs destroy the cans.17 The blast deals a massive amount of raw explosive damage in a 10 km radius, with the damage scaling based on the security level of the system 17:\n  + High-Sec (Lesser): 6,000 damage\n  + Low-Sec (Standard): 8,000 damage\n  + Null-Sec (Improved): 10,000 damage\n  + Wormhole (Superior): 12,000 damage\n* **The NPC Threat:** The NPCs that spawn at the end of the timer are not trivial. They deal significant damage and, critically, will employ warp disruptors to hold any capsuleer on grid, almost guaranteeing the destruction of an unprepared exploration frigate.17\n\nThe extreme risk of Ghost Sites is matched by their extraordinary potential rewards. These sites are a primary source of some of the most valuable \"jackpot\" loot in the game, including blueprint copies for the coveted 'Ascendancy' implant set and rare components used in the construction of capital ships.14 A successful run on a null-sec or wormhole Ghost Site can yield loot worth billions of ISK from a single container.13\n\n### **2.4. Specialized Encounters: Sleeper Caches and Drone Sites**\n\nBeyond the common pirate sites, explorers may encounter more esoteric locations that require specialized knowledge and equipment.\n\n* **Sleeper Caches:** These are the pinnacle of hacking-based exploration, appearing as extremely difficult Level IV and V signatures. Sleeper Caches are not simple collections of containers; they are complex environmental puzzles. A pilot must navigate corrosive gas clouds, survive powerful explosive shockwaves, and solve intricate hacking challenges to unlock the valuable Sleeper technology within.1 These sites demand specialized ship fits and a deep understanding of their mechanics, placing them firmly in the category of endgame content for the master explorer.\n* **Drone Data Sites:** Found exclusively in the null-sec regions controlled by rogue drones (such as Cobalt Edge and Perrigen Falls), these sites offer a unique twist on the standard data site formula. Instead of a container exploding after two failed hacks, a failure has a chance to spawn a small wave of hostile rogue drones.1 These drones must be destroyed before hacking can be re-attempted. More importantly, successfully completing a Drone Data Site has a chance to trigger an \"escalation,\" providing a warp-in to a second, more difficult and lucrative drone site.1 This mechanic makes the drone regions a potentially profitable niche for explorers equipped to handle the minor combat encounters.\n\nThe variety of exploration sites in New Eden offers a spectrum of challenges that cater to different pilot mentalities. Standard Data and Relic sites provide a predictable, methodical \"grind,\" rewarding persistence and efficiency. Ghost Sites are a high-stakes \"heist,\" demanding speed, precision, and a willingness to risk everything for a massive payout. Sleeper Caches are an intellectual \"puzzle,\" testing a pilot's knowledge and problem-solving skills more than their hacking ability. By understanding these distinct gameplay loops, a capsuleer can align their exploration activities with their preferred style of play, ensuring that the journey through the void is not only profitable but also engaging.\n\n## **Section 3: The Profitability Matrix - Maximizing ISK in New Eden**\n\nThe ultimate goal of exploration is the accumulation of wealth, measured in InterStellar Kredits (ISK). Profitability is a complex equation, a function of location, target selection, market knowledge, and luck. A strategic explorer does not wander aimlessly; they operate with an understanding of the economic geography of New Eden, targeting specific regions and items to maximize their return on time and risk invested. This section provides a comprehensive analysis of where the wealth is located and which treasures are most worth seeking.\n\n### **3.1. The Geography of Wealth: A Sector-by-Sector Analysis**\n\nThe value of exploration loot is directly correlated with the security status of the space in which it is found. The greater the risk, the greater the reward.\n\n* **High-Security Space (High-Sec): The Training Ground.** With a security status from 1.0 to 0.5, high-sec is the safest area of New Eden. However, this safety comes at the cost of profitability. The loot from high-sec exploration sites is of the lowest value, and competition from other new players is fierce, meaning most sites are completed shortly after they spawn.3 Income rates are often cited as being as low as 500,000 to 1.5 million ISK per hour, making it an unsustainable career path.23 High-sec should be viewed exclusively as a training ground to learn the mechanics of scanning and hacking before moving on to more dangerous, lucrative regions.\n* **Low-Security Space (Low-Sec): The Crossroads.** In systems with a security status from 0.4 to 0.1, the value of loot increases significantly. However, so does the risk. There is no CONCORD response fleet, and player-versus-player combat is common. Low-sec serves as a middle ground, offering moderate rewards for moderate risk.3 It is here that the relative value of Data and Relic sites becomes a subject of debate, with some pilots reporting that Data sites can be more profitable due to specific, high-value blueprint drops or event-related items.13 A lucky find, such as a capital component BPC, can be worth tens of millions of ISK.22\n* **Null-Security Space (Null-Sec): The Frontier.** Null-sec, with a security status of 0.0, is where exploration becomes a truly profitable enterprise. The loot tables are significantly richer than in low-sec, and the sheer vastness of these regions means that competition for sites is often very low.3 A single null-sec relic site can commonly yield 20-30 million ISK, with lucky finds exceeding 100 million ISK.9 The primary dangers are other players, who can operate without restriction, and the prevalent use of warp disruption bubbles to trap unsuspecting ships.3 Success in null-sec requires constant vigilance and mastery of survival techniques.\n* **Wormhole Space (W-Space): The Abyss.** Accessed via temporary cosmic signatures, wormhole space (or W-space) is the most dangerous and potentially rewarding region for a solo explorer. There is no local chat channel to indicate the presence of other players, meaning a hunter could be cloaked anywhere in the system at any time.9 The unguarded pirate faction sites found in Class 1, 2, and 3 wormholes contain the same high-value loot as null-sec sites but often with zero competition.3 W-space also contains Sleeper sites, which are defended by powerful NPCs and should be avoided by standard exploration frigates.1 For the skilled and risk-tolerant pilot, the desolate emptiness of W-space offers the highest potential for uninterrupted profit.\n\n### **3.2. The Great Debate: Data Sites vs. Relic Sites**\n\nA persistent question among explorers is which site type offers better returns. While luck can lead to a massive payout from either, a clear consensus has emerged based on the underlying economics of New Eden's industry.\n\n* **General Consensus (Null-Sec & W-Space):** For consistent, high-yield income, **Relic sites are superior** to Data sites in null-sec and W-space.9 The T2 salvage materials found in these sites are consumed in vast quantities for the manufacturing of Tech II rigs, creating a stable, high-volume demand. This makes relic loot easy to sell quickly at a predictable price.13 Average payouts for null-sec relic sites are consistently reported in the 20-25 million ISK range, whereas data sites average closer to 5-10 million ISK.9\n* **Data Site Value Proposition:** While their average payout is lower, Data sites should not be ignored. They offer a more consistent, if smaller, income stream from datacores and decryptors.22 Their primary appeal, however, is their \"lottery ticket\" nature. Data sites have a small chance to drop extremely valuable blueprint copies that can be worth hundreds of millions or even billions of ISK—far more than any single relic site could ever yield.22\n* **The Low-Sec Anomaly:** In low-security space, the dynamic can shift. Some evidence suggests that Data sites are more profitable than Relic sites in this band of space, due to a different loot table that can include valuable items not found in null-sec data sites.13\n\nThe optimal strategy is therefore clear: an explorer should always fit both a Data and a Relic analyzer. When operating in null-sec or W-space, the priority should be to complete Relic sites for reliable income. However, any Data site that is scanned down should also be completed. The time investment to find the signature has already been made, and the small chance of a jackpot BPC drop is a risk well worth taking for the few extra minutes of hacking.22\n\n### **3.3. The Treasure Trove: Valuating Key Exploration Loot**\n\nKnowing what to look for is as important as knowing where to look. While market prices are in constant flux, certain items consistently hold high value due to their role in industry and combat. An explorer must learn how to identify and appraise these treasures.\n\n* **Relic Site Valuables:** The most sought-after items are T2 salvage materials. Of these, **Intact Armor Plates** are consistently the most valuable. They are a key component in popular armor rigs and are found exclusively in Relic sites within Sansha's Nation-controlled null-sec space.3 This makes Sansha space the most lucrative, and therefore most dangerous, region for relic hunters.\n* **Data Site Valuables:** The value from data sites comes from two sources:\n  + **Datacores and Decryptors:** These items are the fuel for invention, the process of creating T2 BPCs. Their value is stable and tied directly to the industrial economy.1\n  + **Blueprint Copies (BPCs):** This is where jackpot loot is found. Unlike finished modules, BPCs cannot be sold on the open market. Their value must be assessed by searching for them on **public contracts**. A BPC's worth is determined by the profit margin between the cost of the materials required to build the item and the final sale price of the item itself.29 Many BPCs are worthless, but some, like those for capital ship components or faction structures, can be immensely valuable.3\n* **Ghost Site Jackpots:** These sites contain the rarest and most valuable items an explorer can find. The ultimate prize is a **High-Grade Ascendancy Omega Blueprint Copy**, which can be worth several billion ISK.14 Other high-value drops include\n  **Shattered Villard Wheels** (a component for Ascendancy implants) and BPCs for desirable items like the **'Magpie' Mobile Tractor Unit**.17\n\nSince live market data is volatile, static price lists are unreliable. A professional explorer must be able to appraise their loot in real-time. This is accomplished using third-party web tools that pull data directly from the game's API. Services like **EVE Tycoon Appraisal**, **Janice**, and **Fuzzwork Market Appraisal** allow a pilot to copy-paste the contents of their cargo hold and receive an instant estimate of its value in Jita, the game's primary trade hub.31 Mastering these tools is a non-negotiable skill for anyone serious about making a profit.\n\nThe economic landscape of exploration is not random; it is a direct result of player activity. The high value of Sansha relic sites, for instance, is a consequence of the high demand for armor rigs among the player base. This knowledge creates a feedback loop: valuable regions attract more explorers, which in turn attracts more player-hunters who prey on them.3 This means that the highest theoretical ISK-per-hour may not be the highest actual ISK-per-hour if a pilot spends most of their time evading threats. A more nuanced strategy is often more profitable: identifying a \"good enough\" region with valuable loot that is less popular and therefore less heavily hunted can lead to more consistent and safer income.\n\n| **Table 2: Faction-Specific Relic Salvage & Estimated Value** |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Pirate Faction** | **Key T2 Salvage Material** | **Estimated Jita Sell Value (per unit)** |\n| Sansha's Nation | Intact Armor Plates | 3,000,000 - 4,000,000 ISK |\n| Guristas Pirates | Intact Shield Emitter | 500,000 - 700,000 ISK |\n| Blood Raiders | Capacitor Console | 400,000 - 600,000 ISK |\n| Angel Cartel | Impetus Console | 300,000 - 500,000 ISK |\n| Serpentis | Drone Transceiver | 200,000 - 400,000 ISK |\n| *Note: Prices are estimates based on historical data and are subject to market fluctuation.

Always check public contracts for current pricing before selling.* |  |  |  |\n\n## **Section 4: The Survivor's Doctrine - Risk Mitigation in Hostile Territory**\n\nAcquiring valuable loot is only half the battle. All profit is theoretical until it is safely delivered to a market hub. In the lawless regions of null-sec and W-space, survival is paramount. A fragile exploration frigate is a tempting target for any predator, and a cargo hold full of valuable salvage can turn a minor loss into a catastrophic financial blow. This section outlines the essential doctrines of risk mitigation, teaching the active, information-driven process required to navigate hostile territory and secure one's earnings.\n\n### **4.1. The Most Important Tool: Mastering the Directional Scanner (D-Scan)**\n\nThe Directional Scanner, or D-Scan, is the single most critical tool for survival in EVE Online. It is a capsuleer's eyes and ears, providing a snapshot of all ships, probes, and other objects within a 14.3 AU radius.12 Mastering its use is not optional; it is the foundation of situational awareness.\n\nA proficient explorer's gameplay involves a constant, rhythmic use of the D-Scan. The process should become second nature:\n\n1. Set the D-Scan range to maximum and the angle to 360 degrees.\n2. Continuously activate the scanner (default hotkey 'V') every few seconds, especially when stationary, in warp, or hacking a container.\n3. Learn to interpret the results instantly. The primary threats to look for are:\n   * **Combat Scanner Probes:** The appearance of these on D-Scan means another player is actively hunting for ships in the system. If you are not in a ship with a Covert Ops cloak, this is an immediate signal to align to a celestial and warp away.10\n   * **Other Ships:** Identify any ships on D-Scan. Are they industrial ships that pose no threat, or are they combat vessels known for hunting explorers, such as an Astero or a T3C?\n   * **Warp Disruption Probes:** These indicate the presence of a Heavy Interdictor, a ship capable of deploying a warp disruption bubble.\n\nThe D-Scan is a proactive tool. Its purpose is to detect threats before they can get a warp-in on your location. The mindset of an explorer must be one of \"active paranoia\"—a constant state of information gathering to build a mental map of the system and preempt any hostile action.\n\n### **4.2. Creating Sanctums: Bookmarks and Safe Spots**\n\nIn dangerous space, sitting still is an invitation to be scanned down and destroyed. An explorer needs safe locations from which to operate. Warping between celestial objects like gates, stations, or planets is predictable and unsafe, as hunters can easily position themselves along these common travel vectors.7 The solution is to create custom\n\n**bookmarks** in deep space, known as **safe spots**.\n\nA safe spot is a location far from any standard warp-in point, making it difficult for a hunter to land near you. A basic safe spot can be created by dropping a bookmark while in warp between two celestials.34 However, a far more secure method is the \"triangle\" technique 5:\n\n1. Create a bookmark (Bookmark A) midway through a warp between two distant celestials.\n2. Warp to a third celestial and create another bookmark (Bookmark B) midway through that warp.\n3. Warp between Bookmark A and Bookmark B, and create a third bookmark (Bookmark C) in the middle of that warp.\n   This final bookmark, C, is now in a position that is not on a direct line between any two major points of interest in the system, making it extremely difficult to find by chance. From this cloaked, secure location, an explorer can safely launch probes and scan the system for signatures.\n\n### **4.3. Navigational Hazards: Evading Gate Camps and Bubbles**\n\nThe transition points between systems—stargates—are the most dangerous locations in null-sec. They are natural chokepoints where hunters, known as \"gate campers,\" lie in wait to ambush travelers.\n\n* **Gate Camps:** Before jumping into a new system, it is wise to use D-Scan to check the destination gate for threats. From a celestial near your current gate, narrow the D-Scan angle to 5 or 15 degrees and aim it at the destination gate to see if ships are waiting on the other side.10\n* **Warp Disruption Bubbles:** In null-sec and W-space, Interdictor and Heavy Interdictor ships can deploy mobile warp disruptors, creating a sphere of energy (a \"bubble\") that will pull any ship warping nearby out of warp and prevent them from warping away again. These are commonly placed on and around stargates.\n* **Countermeasures:** The most effective defense against bubbles is an **Interdiction Nullifier** module, which can be fitted to T2 Covert Ops frigates and T3Cs. When activated, it provides temporary immunity to all forms of warp disruption, including bubbles, allowing a ship to warp away freely.5 For ships without this module, survival depends on situational awareness and careful navigation, such as creating bookmarks more than 150 km away from a gate to warp to a safe perch and observe the situation before proceeding.\n\n### **4.4. Advanced Tactics: Running Ghost Sites**\n\nSuccessfully profiting from Ghost Sites requires a specific strategy tailored to their unique, high-risk mechanics. Two primary doctrines have emerged.\n\n* **The Blitz Strategy:** This is the preferred method for fragile exploration frigates. The goal is to maximize profit while minimizing time on-site.\n  1. Warp to the site. Upon landing, immediately use a **Cargo Scanner** to quickly identify the contents of the four containers.17\n  2. Identify the single most valuable container. Often, one container will have significantly better loot than the others.14\n  3. Activate the MWD and approach that container at high speed.\n  4. Hack the container as quickly as possible.\n  5. Loot the contents and immediately warp to a safe spot.\n     This strategy accepts that you will likely only hack one, perhaps two, containers before the site's defenses activate. It prioritizes securing a portion of the loot over risking everything for a full clear.14\n* **The Tank Strategy:** This approach is reserved for ships specifically fitted to survive the site's catastrophic failure state, such as an armor-plated Stratios or a T3C.\n  1. The ship is fitted with a massive buffer tank, typically using one or two 1600mm Reinforced Steel Plates and modules that increase explosive resistance, to absorb the 10,000-12,000 damage from the container explosion.14\n  2. With the ability to survive the explosion and the initial volleys from the defending NPCs, the pilot has more time to hack multiple, or even all, of the containers before the NPCs can destroy them.14 This strategy maximizes potential profit but requires a significant investment in a specialized and expensive ship.\n\nA further advanced tactic for risk mitigation is **loot jettisoning**. Before attempting a particularly difficult or risky hack, a pilot can create a bookmark at their location and eject their current loot into a jettison container. If the ship is destroyed, the pilot can return in a new vessel, warp to the bookmark, and retrieve the secured loot from the container, which will remain in space for a period of time.10\n\n### **4.5. Securing the Profit: Loot Management and Extraction**\n\nAn explorer's cargo hold is a magnet for aggression. Flying with hundreds of millions of ISK in a ship worth a fraction of that value is a recipe for disaster.34 Therefore, effective loot management and extraction are final, critical components of the survival doctrine.\n\n* **Periodic Offloading:** A pilot should never carry more loot than they are willing to lose. It is essential to periodically offload accumulated treasure. This can be done by docking at a friendly player-owned structure in null-sec or by finding a wormhole that leads back to high-sec to deposit the loot in an NPC station.5\n* **Filament Extraction:** A modern and highly effective method for both travel and extraction involves the use of **filaments**. Needlejack filaments can teleport a small fleet to a random null-sec system, allowing an explorer to instantly access fresh, unexplored territory.34 More importantly,\n  Pochven filaments can be used to enter the Triglavian-controlled region of Pochven, from which another filament can be used to exit to a random high-sec system. This provides a powerful, albeit unpredictable, method for extracting valuable loot from deep in null-sec without having to traverse dozens of potentially camped gates.7\n\nSurvival in EVE is not a passive state achieved by fitting the right module. It is an active, continuous process of information management. The successful explorer is not just a hacker; they are an intelligence analyst, constantly D-scanning, monitoring local chat, researching potential threats on third-party killboards, and using every available tool to stay one step ahead of the predators that roam the void.\n\n## **Conclusions and Recommendations**\n\nThe path of the explorer in New Eden is a challenging but potentially lucrative career for a capsuleer. It offers a unique blend of solitary discovery, intellectual challenge, and high-stakes risk management. For the novice pilot who began with questions about \"Zero Data Cores\" and \"EVE: Void,\" the journey from confusion to mastery is a microcosm of the *EVE Online* experience itself: complex, demanding, but ultimately rewarding for those who invest in knowledge and preparation.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of exploration mechanics, economic landscapes, and survival doctrines, the following conclusions and actionable recommendations are presented:\n\n1. **Prioritize Foundational Skills and Equipment:** Success is built upon a strong foundation. A new pilot's immediate goals should be to train the core \"Astrometrics\" trio and Hacking/Archaeology skills. The Caldari **Heron** frigate is the objectively superior starting vessel due to its flexible slot layout, which compensates for low skill levels. Investment in Sisters Core Scanner Probes is the single most cost-effective upgrade to improve scanning efficiency.\n2. **Adopt a Tiered Approach to Risk:** The geography of New Eden dictates a natural progression.\n   * **High-Sec** should be treated solely as a safe environment to practice the mechanics of scanning and hacking. It is not a viable source of income.\n   * **Low-Sec** serves as an intermediate step, introducing the element of player risk while offering moderate rewards. It is a good place to test survival instincts.\n   * **Null-Sec and Class 1-3 Wormhole Space** are the primary theaters of operation for a professional explorer. The significantly higher value of loot in these regions makes them the only logical choice for serious wealth generation. A pilot should aim to graduate to operating in these areas as soon as they are confident in their survival skills.\n3. **Embrace the \"Relic Priority, Data Opportunity\" Doctrine:** The economic data is clear: in null-sec and W-space, **Relic sites provide the most consistent and reliable income**. The high demand for T2 salvage ensures a stable market. Therefore, Relic sites should be the primary focus. However, **Data sites represent a crucial \"lottery\" opportunity**. The chance of acquiring a multi-billion ISK blueprint copy, however small, makes them an essential secondary target. The optimal strategy is to always fit both analyzer types and complete any Data site discovered during the hunt for Relics.\n4. **Master the Art of Active Paranoia:** Profitability is meaningless without survival. The core skill of a successful explorer is not hacking, but **situational awareness**. The constant, disciplined use of the **Directional Scanner** is non-negotiable. This must be combined with diligent monitoring of the local chat channel, the creation and use of safe-spot bookmarks, and an understanding of navigational hazards like gate camps and warp disruption bubbles. Survival is an active, information-driven process, not a passive state.\n5. **Strategize Beyond the Loot Table:** The most valuable regions, such as Sansha space, are also the most dangerous precisely because their value is common knowledge. A truly strategic explorer will look beyond the simple data of \"best loot\" and factor in player population and activity. Seeking out quieter, less-traveled but still valuable regions can often yield a higher net profit over time by minimizing downtime spent evading hunters and reducing the risk of catastrophic loss.\n\nThe journey of an explorer is one of continuous learning and adaptation. From the first successful hack in a cheap Heron to a multi-billion ISK haul from a wormhole Ghost Site in a specialized T3 Cruiser, the principles remain the same: prepare diligently, operate cautiously, understand the value of your discovery, and always, always watch your back. The void is dark and full of dangers, but for the prepared capsuleer, it is also full of treasure.\n\n#### 引用的著作\n\n1.
