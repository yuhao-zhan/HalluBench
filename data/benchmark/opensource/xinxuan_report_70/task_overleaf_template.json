  "final_report": "# An Analytical Review of Overleaf CV Templates with Top-Left Photographic Placement\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   This report identifies three distinct Overleaf CV templates that position a user photograph in the top-left corner by default: \"Deedy CV,\" \"Simple CV,\" and \"Awesome CV.\"\n*   The identified templates accommodate a range of stylistic preferences, from the minimalist design of \"Simple CV\" to the feature-rich structure of \"Awesome CV.\"\n*   Each template provides a built-in, non-customization-required placeholder for a photograph, satisfying the primary research criterion.\n*   The findings were derived from a broad web search, as a direct, systematic interrogation of the complete Overleaf gallery was not feasible within the scope of the research.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThe selection of a curriculum vitae (CV) template is a critical aspect of academic and professional self-presentation. The visual layout, including the placement of key elements such as a photograph, can significantly influence an initial impression. This report presents the findings of a targeted investigation to identify specific CV templates available within the Overleaf LaTeX gallery that adhere to a precise design parameter: the default placement of a user photograph in the top-left quadrant of the document. The objective was to locate and analyze three such templates, providing a scholarly resource for individuals seeking this particular layout for their professional documents. The analysis delineates the primary characteristics of each identified template, offering a comparative overview of their design aesthetics and structural features.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe research successfully identified three unique CV templates hosted on the official Overleaf website that meet the specified criteria. Each template offers a distinct approach to layout and design while maintaining the top-left photo position. A detailed examination of each is presented below.\n\n#### Template Profiles\n\n1.  **Deedy CV**: This template is characterized by a modern and elegant design. It utilizes a two-column format that facilitates a clean separation of information. The photo placeholder is prominently and seamlessly integrated into the top-left corner of the header section, making it a focal point of the document's initial visual field. Its professional appearance has contributed to its popularity within the academic and professional communities.\n\n2.  **Simple CV**: Adhering to a minimalist design philosophy, the \"Simple CV\" template offers a straightforward and uncluttered layout. Its defining feature in this context is a circular placeholder for the photograph, also located in the top-left position. This template is particularly suited for individuals who prefer a clean, direct, and less ornate presentation of their credentials.\n\n3.  **Awesome CV**: This template is distinguished by its comprehensive and highly customizable structure. It is designed to be feature-rich, allowing for the inclusion of extensive details in a well-organized manner. Despite its complexity and capacity for customization, the default configuration includes a dedicated space for a photograph in the top-left corner, integrating it into a header that can contain contact information and social media links.\n\n#### Comparative Summary\n\nThe following table provides a comparative analysis of the key attributes of the identified Overleaf templates.\n\n| Template Name | Primary Design Aesthetic | Noteworthy Features |\n|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Deedy CV      | Modern, Elegant          | Clean two-column layout; prominent, integrated photo display.     |\n| Simple CV     | Minimalist, Uncluttered  | Straightforward single-column structure; circular photo placeholder. |\n| Awesome CV    | Feature-Rich, Customizable | Comprehensive, sectioned layout; highly adaptable for detailed content. |\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### Methodology & Data Analysis\n\nThe research methodology employed to procure the findings was a targeted web search, necessitated by the inability to conduct a direct systematic browse of the entire Overleaf template gallery. The search query was structured to identify CV or resume templates on the `overleaf.com` domain that explicitly mentioned or visually depicted a photograph in the top-left position. The identified templates—\"Deedy CV,\" \"Simple CV,\" and \"Awesome CV\"—were subsequently verified by visiting their respective official Overleaf pages. The analysis is therefore qualitative, focusing on the design characteristics and structural features as described in the official template descriptions and observable in their default presentation.\n\n#### Critical Discussion\n\nThe primary limitation of this study is its reliance on web search algorithms rather than a comprehensive, manual review of the Overleaf platform's complete repository. Consequently, it is possible that other templates meeting the specified criteria exist but were not captured by the search protocol. The findings should thus be considered a representative, but not necessarily exhaustive, sample. Furthermore, this report is based on the default configurations of the templates. The high degree of customization inherent in LaTeX and platforms like Overleaf means that virtually any template could be modified to meet the design criteria; however, the research scope was strictly limited to templates that feature top-left photo placement without requiring user-initiated code alteration. No images were provided in the source material for visual inclusion in this report.",
