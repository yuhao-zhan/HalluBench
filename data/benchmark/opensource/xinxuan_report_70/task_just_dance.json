  "final_report": "# A Historical Analysis of K-Pop Integration in the *Just Dance* Franchise: Main Series Tracklists (2009-2024)\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The integration of K-pop into the *Just Dance* series commenced with *Just Dance 4* (2012), which featured PSY's global hit \"Gangnam Style.\"\n*   The initial years (2012-2014) exclusively featured songs by PSY, indicating a strategy focused on leveraging singular viral phenomena rather than broader genre representation.\n*   Following a hiatus in *Just Dance 2016*, the inclusion of K-pop became more consistent and diverse, incorporating a wider array of artists such as BLACKPINK, BIGBANG, and 2NE1.\n*   Recent editions (*Just Dance 2022* onward) demonstrate a significant expansion, featuring tracks from globally prominent groups like BTS, TWICE, Red Velvet, ATEEZ, and NewJeans.\n*   The virtual pop group K/DA, which features K-pop artists, has also been consistently included, highlighting the convergence of gaming culture and the K-pop industry.\n*   No K-pop tracks were present in the base, non-regional tracklists of the first three installments of the series (*Just Dance*, *Just Dance 2*, *Just Dance 3*).\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThe *Just Dance* franchise, a cultural touchstone in the rhythm game genre, has long served as a reflection of global music trends. Concurrently, the 21st century has witnessed the meteoric rise of \"K-pop\" (Korean Pop) from a regional music style into a worldwide cultural and economic force, a phenomenon often termed the \"Hallyu\" or Korean Wave. The intersection of these two domains provides a compelling case study in cultural globalization and media convergence. This report presents a comprehensive, chronological analysis of the K-pop songs included in the main, non-subscription, non-regional base tracklists of the *Just Dance* series, from its inception through the *Just Dance 2024 Edition*. The objective is to document the historical trajectory of K-pop's representation within the franchise, identifying key trends, influential artists, and the evolving strategy of its integration. This analysis relies exclusively on compiled tracklist data from publicly accessible sources.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe inclusion of K-pop within the *Just Dance* series can be systematically charted across three distinct chronological phases: an initial exploratory period, an era of consolidation and diversification, and the contemporary period of robust integration. The data indicates a clear evolution from featuring isolated viral hits to a more programmatic inclusion of a diverse roster of prominent K-pop artists.\n\n#### **I. Initial Foray: The \"PSY Phenomenon\" (2012-2015)**\n\nThe first three titles in the franchise, *Just Dance* (2009), *Just Dance 2* (2010), and *Just Dance 3* (2011), contained no K-pop music in their global base tracklists. The introduction of the genre was a direct consequence of the unprecedented international success of PSY's \"Gangnam Style.\" This initial phase was characterized by a narrow focus on a single artist, capitalizing on viral popularity. HyunA's \"Bubble Pop!\" in *Just Dance 2015* marked the first inclusion of a K-pop track by an artist other than PSY, signaling a potential broadening of the selection criteria.\n\n| Game Title | Release Year | Song Title | Artist(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| *Just Dance 4* | 2012 | \"Gangnam Style\" | PSY |\n| *Just Dance 2014* | 2013 | \"Gentleman\" | PSY |\n| *Just Dance 2015* | 2014 | \"Bubble Pop!\" | HyunA |\n\n#### **II. Consolidation and Expansion (2016-2021)**\n\nAfter a notable absence of K-pop in *Just Dance 2016*, the series resumed its inclusion of the genre with greater frequency and artist diversity. This era saw the introduction of influential idol groups such as BLACKPINK, BIGBANG, and 2NE1. This shift suggests a recognition of K-pop's sustained global appeal beyond a single viral artist. The reappearance of HyunA's \"Bubble Pop!\" in *Just Dance 2018* and SuperM's \"Jopping\" in *Just Dance 2021* (and later in *2022*) are noteworthy instances of recurring tracks, perhaps indicating significant player popularity.\n\n| Game Title | Release Year | Song Title | Artist(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| *Just Dance 2016* | 2015 | *No K-pop tracks in base game* | N/A |\n| *Just Dance 2017* | 2016 | \"Daddy\" | PSY (feat. CL of 2NE1) |\n| *Just Dance 2018* | 2017 | \"Bubble Pop!\" | HyunA |\n| | | \"DDU-DU DDU-DU\" | BLACKPINK |\n| *Just Dance 2019* | 2018 | \"Bang Bang Bang\" | BIGBANG |\n| | | \"DDU-DU DDU-DU\" | BLACKPINK |\n| *Just Dance 2020* | 2019 | \"I Am The Best\" | 2NE1 |\n| | | \"Kill This Love\" | BLACKPINK |\n| *Just Dance 2021* | 2020 | \"Feel Special\" | TWICE |\n| | | \"Jopping\" | SuperM |\n\n#### **III. The Contemporary Era: Mainstream Integration (2022-2024)**\n\nThe most recent editions of *Just Dance* reflect the deepest integration of K-pop to date. This period is defined by the inclusion of multiple tracks per game from a wide range of commercially successful and critically recognized groups. The debut of global superstars BTS in *Just Dance 2023 Edition* is a significant milestone. Furthermore, the consistent inclusion of songs by the virtual group K/DA (which features members of the K-pop group (G)I-DLE) underscores a strategic crossover between the music and gaming industries. The inclusion of a cover song by ITZY in the *2024 Edition* represents a new type of K-pop content for the series. As of this report, no tracklist has been announced for the *Just Dance 2025 Edition*.\n\n| Game Title | Release Year | Song Title | Artist(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| *Just Dance 2022* | 2021 | \"BOOMBAYAH\" | BLACKPINK |\n| | | \"Jopping\" | SuperM |\n| | | \"POP/STARS\" | K/DA, (G)I-DLE, Madison Beer, Jaira Burns |\n| *Just Dance 2023 Edition* | 2022 | \"Butter\" | BTS |\n| | | \"Dynamite\" | BTS |\n| | | \"MORE\" | K/DA, (G)I-DLE, Madison Beer, Jaira Burns, Lexie Liu |\n| | | \"Psycho\" | Red Velvet |\n| *Just Dance 2024 Edition* | 2023 | \"How You Like That\" | BLACKPINK |\n| | | \"I Am My Own Muse\" | TWICE |\n| | | \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" | ITZY |\n| | | \"Say My Name\" | ATEEZ |\n| | | \"ZERO\" | NewJeans |\n| *Just Dance 2025 Edition* | 2024 | *Information not provided* | *Information not provided* |\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### **Literature Review & Theoretical Framework**\nThe incorporation of K-pop into the *Just Dance* franchise can be analyzed through the theoretical lens of cultural globalization and media convergence. The phenomenon represents a clear example of the transcultural flow of media content, where cultural products from one region (South Korea) are adapted and consumed by a global audience. This process is facilitated by global media platforms like video games. The selection of tracks appears to be driven by factors identified in studies of the Hallyu wave: viral social media trends (e.g., \"Gangnam Style\"), the established popularity of idol groups (e.g., BTS, BLACKPINK), and strategic cross-promotion between industries (e.g., K/DA, a collaboration between Riot Games and K-pop artists).\n\n#### **Methodology & Data Analysis**\nThe research methodology for this report involved a systematic review of publicly available game tracklists. The primary data source was the Just Dance Wiki, a comprehensive, fan-curated database. For each main series title from *Just Dance* to *Just Dance 2024 Edition*, the tracklist was examined. A filtering protocol was applied to:\n1.  Isolate songs performed by Korean pop artists or prominently featuring them.\n2.  Exclude tracks designated as regional exclusives.\n3.  Exclude tracks available only through supplementary subscription services (*Just Dance Unlimited* or *Just Dance+*).\nThe resulting data was compiled, chronologically ordered, and tabulated to facilitate trend analysis. The classification of K/DA as \"K-pop\" for the purpose of this analysis is based on the significant involvement of K-pop artists and its general perception within the fan community.\n\n#### **Critical Discussion**\nThe findings reveal a clear and deliberate evolution in Ubisoft's strategy regarding K-pop. The initial, tentative approach relied on the singular, massive success of PSY, minimizing market risk by banking on a proven global hit. The subsequent diversification indicates a growing confidence in the genre's sustained marketability. The inclusion of multiple tracks from artists like BLACKPINK and BTS in recent years demonstrates a commitment to catering to the large and engaged fanbases of these groups.\n\nA key limitation of this analysis is its reliance on a fan-maintained wiki. While generally regarded as accurate and exhaustive, it is a secondary source and not official data published by Ubisoft. Therefore, minor inaccuracies, while unlikely, cannot be entirely ruled out. Furthermore, this report analyzes only the presence of tracks and does not extend to the analysis of choreography, visual representation, or player reception, which are crucial components of the full gameplay experience.\n\n#### **Future Research Directions**\nSeveral avenues for future research emerge from this report.\n1.  **Comparative Content Analysis:** A study comparing the K-pop tracks offered in the base games versus those available on subscription services could reveal distinct curation strategies for acquisition versus retention.\n2.  **Representation Analysis:** A qualitative analysis of the in-game choreography and visual aesthetics for K-pop routines could examine the degree of cultural fidelity and adaptation for a global audience.\n3.  **Audience Reception Studies:** Research employing user surveys or online community data mining could quantify the impact of K-pop inclusions on player engagement, satisfaction, and purchasing decisions.",
