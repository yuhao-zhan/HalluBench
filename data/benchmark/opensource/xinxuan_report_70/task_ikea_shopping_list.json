  "final_report": "# An Analysis of Budget-Constrained Furniture Procurement: A Case Study of IKEA Bedroom Combinations\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   A systematic, multi-step research process was employed to identify low-cost IKEA bedroom furniture items and generate complete, five-piece sets.\n*   The study successfully identified 36 distinct furniture combinations that adhere to a strict budgetary constraint of $200 to $600.\n*   All valid combinations utilize the KLEPPSTAD two-door wardrobe, which was the sole low-cost option identified in its category.\n*   The total cost for a complete five-piece bedroom set ranged from a minimum of $274.96 to a maximum of $398.96, indicating significant financial viability within the upper budget limit.\n*   The analysis highlights the pivotal role of specific entry-level products, such as the `LINNMON / ADILS` table and `ADDE` chair, in achieving the lowest-cost configurations.\n*   The methodological approach combined targeted web-based data collection with computational analysis to exhaustively evaluate all possible product combinations against the set budget.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report presents a systematic investigation into the feasibility of furnishing a complete bedroom with items from IKEA while adhering to a defined budget of $200 to $600. The research objective was to generate a viable shopping list comprising five essential furniture pieces: a bed frame (Full or Queen), a two-door wardrobe, a desk, a chair, and a floor lamp. The items were required to be white or align with a white color scheme.\n\nThe study was conducted in three phases. The initial phase involved targeted data collection from the IKEA United States website to identify the most affordable product options within each of the five specified categories. The second phase curated this data, recording product names, prices, and direct purchase URLs. The final phase employed a computational method to generate all possible combinations of the identified items, calculate the total cost for each permutation, and filter the results to isolate only those that met the budgetary criteria. This report details the methodology, presents the collected data, and provides a comprehensive analysis of the resulting budget-compliant furniture sets.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### **4.1 Component Identification and Data Collection**\n\nThe foundational stage of this research involved a targeted search of the IKEA US online catalog to identify candidate products. The selection criteria were strictly limited to the lowest-priced items available for each of the five required furniture categories. While the primary request specified \"white\" furniture, the search included items noted for their compatibility with such a theme, such as unfinished pine which is commonly painted.\n\n**4.1.1 Wardrobes and Bed Frames**\n\nThe search for a two-door wardrobe yielded a single low-cost model that met the criteria. For bed frames, several affordable options in both Full/Double and Queen sizes were identified. It is noted that the identified bed frames are pine, offering a base for customization to fit a white color scheme.\n\n| Category | Product Name | Size | Price |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |\n| Wardrobe | KLEPPSTAD Wardrobe with 2 doors, white | N/A | $129.99 |\n| Bed Frame| NEIDEN Bed frame, pine | Full | $89.99 |\n| Bed Frame| TARVA Bed frame, pine | Full | $129.00 |\n| Bed Frame| TARVA Bed frame, pine | Queen | $149.00 |\n\n**4.1.2 Desks, Chairs, and Floor Lamps**\n\nSimilarly, the investigation into desks, chairs, and floor lamps focused on entry-level models. Several options were found for each category, providing variability for the subsequent combinatorial analysis. The `LERSTA` lamp, while aluminum, was included for its neutral metallic finish and affordability.\n\n| Category | Product Name | Price |\n| :--- | :--- | ---: |\n| Desk | LINNMON / ADILS Table, white, 39 3/8x23 5/8\" | $29.99 |\n| Desk | MICKE Desk, white, 28 3/4x19 5/8\" | $49.99 |\n| Desk | MICKE Desk, white, 41 3/8x19 5/8\" | $59.99 |\n| Chair | ADDE Chair, white | $15.00 |\n| Chair | LOBERGET / BLYSKÄR Swivel chair, white | $39.99 |\n| Floor Lamp | TAGARP Floor uplighter, black/white | $9.99 |\n| Floor Lamp | LERSTA Floor/reading lamp, aluminum | $19.99 |\n\n#### **4.2 Combinatorial Analysis and Budget Adherence**\n\nFollowing data collection, a computational script was used to perform a combinatorial analysis. This process generated the Cartesian product of the five sets of items (one wardrobe, three bed frames, three desks, two chairs, and two floor lamps), resulting in 36 unique furniture combinations. For each combination, the total cost was calculated by summing the prices of the five constituent items.\n\nThe final step filtered these 36 combinations, retaining only those with a total cost between $200.00 and $600.00. The analysis revealed that all 36 combinations successfully met this criterion. The resulting valid shopping lists are detailed in the table below. The total costs range from a minimum of $274.96 to a maximum of $398.96, comfortably within the specified budget. This demonstrates that numerous configurations exist to furnish a bedroom affordably based on the selected IKEA products.\n\n| Wardrobe | Bed Frame | Desk | Chair | Floor Lamp | Total Cost |\n| :--- |

Framework**\n\nThis empirical study can be situated within the theoretical framework of budget-constrained optimization in consumer behavior. This theory posits that consumers make purchasing decisions to maximize utility (satisfaction) subject to a budgetary constraint. The present research operationalizes this concept by treating the \"utility\" as the successful assembly of a complete, five-piece bedroom set and the \"budget\" as the explicit $200-$600 monetary limit. The combinatorial analysis serves as a practical methodology for identifying all points on the \"budget line\" using a predefined set of goods, thereby providing a clear set of optimal choices under the given constraints.\n\n#### **Methodology & Data Analysis**\n\nThe research employed a structured, multi-phase methodology:\n1.  **Phase 1: Data Scoping and Collection**: The initial parameters were defined: five specific furniture categories, a white/neutral color scheme, and a total cost between $200 and $600. Data collection consisted of manual, targeted searches on the IKEA US website to identify the lowest-priced item in each category.\n2.  **Phase 2: Data Curation**: Product data, including exact name, price, and URL, were extracted and organized into structured tables for systematic analysis.\n3.  **Phase 3: Combinatorial Algorithm**: A computational script was designed to generate the Cartesian product of the item lists from each of the five categories. This ensured an exhaustive enumeration of all possible five-item combinations.\n4.  **Phase 4: Filtering and Selection**: The total cost was calculated for each unique combination. A filter was then applied to this complete set to isolate the subset of combinations whose total cost fell within the predefined budget range of $200-$600.\n\n#### **Critical Discussion**\n\nThe findings demonstrate a high degree of success in meeting the research objective. The fact that all 36 possible combinations fall within the budget, and that the maximum total cost ($398.96) is substantially below the $600 ceiling, indicates that IKEA's low-cost product range offers considerable flexibility for budget-conscious consumers.\n\nHowever, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the findings are a snapshot based on pricing and product availability at the time of data collection (August 2025) and are subject to change. Second, the product selection was deliberately narrow, focusing only on the most affordable options. This excludes a vast range of other products that might offer different aesthetic, material, or functional qualities. Third, the \"white\" color requirement was met with some interpretation; the `NEIDEN` and `TARVA` bed frames are unfinished pine, which would require additional effort and cost (paint) to become white. The `LERSTA` lamp is aluminum, which fits a neutral palette but is not explicitly white. This study did not factor in ancillary costs such as taxes, shipping fees, or customization supplies.\n\n#### **Future Research Directions**\n\nFuture research could expand upon this study in several ways. A broader range of products, including mid-tier options, could be included to analyze the trade-offs between cost and features. The model could be developed into a dynamic tool, potentially using API access to IKEA's database, to provide real-time, customizable budget shopping lists. Comparative analyses could be conducted across different furniture retailers to assess their relative value propositions. Finally, qualitative factors, such as product durability, ease of assembly, and consumer review scores, could be integrated into the model to provide a more holistic recommendation system.",
