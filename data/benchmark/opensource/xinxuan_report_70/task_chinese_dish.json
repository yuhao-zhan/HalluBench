The available primary components include potatoes, chicken thighs, cilantro, scallions, and cucumbers, supplemented by basic pantry staples such as oil, salt, MSG, soy sauce, and vinegar.\n\nThe research has identified a functionally and gastronomically complementary pairing: Xinjiang Big Plate Chicken (Â§ßÁõòÈ∏°, *D√† P√°n Jƒ´*) as the main course and Smashed Cucumber Salad (ÊãçÈªÑÁìú, *PƒÅi Hu√°ngguƒÅ*) as a side dish.
