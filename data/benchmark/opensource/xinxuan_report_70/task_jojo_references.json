  "final_report": "# A Methodological Framework for Identifying 1970s Musical Allusions in Hirohiko Araki's *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* (Parts 4-6)\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   A systematic, three-step research methodology was designed to identify, verify, and document specific musical references from the 1970s within Parts 4, 5, and 6 of the manga series *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*.\n*   Initial data compilation from encyclopedic fan wikis produced an extensive list of allusions, demonstrating a high density of references to Western popular music across the specified story arcs.\n*   The filtering process successfully isolated eight prominent characters or Stands named after musical works or artists from the 1970-1979 period, with a notable prevalence of references to the bands Queen and Pink Floyd.\n*   Verification against music databases confirmed the release years for key allusions, including \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" (1975), \"Killer Queen\" (1974), and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" (1975).\n*   The final data retrieval stage highlighted methodological challenges, as initial automated searches for direct media links on the Spotify platform yielded incomplete or erroneous results for two of the five selected examples.\n*   The study confirms that these musical allusions are a deliberate and integral stylistic element of the series, often reflecting the thematic or functional attributes of the characters and their abilities.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nHirohiko Araki's manga series, *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*, is distinguished by its extensive and systematic use of intertextual references, particularly to Western popular music. This report outlines the execution of a research plan designed to systematically identify characters and \"Stands\" (the corporeal manifestations of a character's psychic power) from Parts 4 (*Diamond is Unbreakable*), 5 (*Vento Aureo*), and 6 (*Stone Ocean*) whose names are direct allusions to songs or albums released between 1970 and 1979.\n\nThe objective of this research was to move beyond anecdotal recognition of these references and establish a verifiable dataset. The process involved a three-stage methodology: (1) a comprehensive compilation of all musical references within the specified parts; (2) a filtering and verification stage to isolate allusions specific to the 1970s decade; and (3) the acquisition of direct media links for a representative sample of five confirmed references. This structured approach provides a transparent and replicable framework for cultural analysis within the text and demonstrates the process of academic data collection and refinement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe research was executed through a sequential, multi-step process designed to ensure data accuracy and methodological transparency.\n\n#### **Stage 1: Comprehensive Data Compilation**\n\nThe initial stage involved a broad data collection effort to catalogue all potential musical references in Parts 4, 5, and 6. The primary source for this compilation was the JoJo's Bizarre Encyclopedia, a comprehensive, fan-curated wiki. The collected data reveals a wide array of allusions, drawing from diverse genres and decades, though with a clear emphasis on rock music from the 1970s and 1980s. The tables below present a selection of the raw, unverified data gathered in this stage.\n\n**Table 1: Selected Musical References in Part 4 - *Diamond is Unbreakable***\n| Character/Stand | Musical Reference |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Crazy Diamond | Pink Floyd's song \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" |\n| Killer Queen | Queen's song \"Killer Queen\" |\n| Sheer Heart Attack | Queen's album and song of the same name |\n| Bites the Dust | Queen's song \"Another One Bites the Dust\" |\n| Highway Star | Deep Purple's song \"Highway Star\" |\n| Earth Wind and Fire | The band Earth, Wind & Fire |\n| Super Fly | Curtis Mayfield's song \"Superfly\" |\n| Atom Heart Father | Pink Floyd's album *Atom Heart Mother* |\n\n**Table 2: Selected Musical References in Part 5 - *Vento Aureo***\n| Character/Stand | Musical Reference |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Sticky Fingers | The Rolling Stones' album *Sticky Fingers* |\n| Sex Pistols | The band Sex Pistols |\n| Aerosmith | The band Aerosmith |\n| Moody Blues | The band The Moody Blues |\n| King Crimson | The band King Crimson |\n| Black Sabbath | The band Black Sabbath |\n| Soft Machine | The band Soft Machine |\n| Kraft Werk | The band Kraftwerk |\n| Green Day | The band Green Day |\n| Oasis | The band Oasis |\n\n**Table 3: Selected Musical References in Part 6 - *Stone Ocean***\n| Character/Stand | Musical Reference |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Jolyne Cujoh | Dolly Parton song \"Jolene\" |\n| Stone Free | The Jimi Hendrix Experience song \"Stone Free\" |\n| Kiss | The band Kiss |\n| Whitesnake | The band Whitesnake |\n| C-MOON | Paul McCartney and Wings song \"C Moon\" |\n| Made in Heaven | Queen album *Made in Heaven* |\n| Highway to Hell | The AC/DC song \"Highway to Hell\" |\n| Bohemian Rhapsody | The Queen song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" |\n\n#### **Stage 2: Temporal Filtering and Verification**\n\nThe second stage involved filtering the comprehensive list to isolate references originating strictly within the 1970-1979 timeframe. Each potential reference was cross-validated using online music databases such as Discogs to confirm the artist and exact release year. This step was critical for refining the dataset and ensuring its accuracy. For instance, \"Bites the Dust\" was excluded as its source, Queen's \"Another One Bites the Dust,\" was released in 1980. Similarly, King Crimson's debut album was released in 1969, and Queen's *Made in Heaven* was released in 1995, placing them outside the specified temporal scope.\n\nThe following table presents the verified list of 1970s musical references.\n\n**Table 4: Verified 1970s Musical References**\n| Character/Stand | Musical Reference | Artist/Band | Release Year |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Crazy Diamond | \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" | Pink Floyd | 1975 |\n| Killer Queen | \"Killer Queen\" | Queen | 1974 |\n| Sheer Heart Attack | *Sheer Heart Attack* | Queen | 1974 |\n| Highway Star | \"Highway Star\" | Deep Purple | 1972 |\n| Sticky Fingers | *Sticky Fingers* | The Rolling Stones | 1971 |\n| Black Sabbath | *Black Sabbath* | Black Sabbath | 1970 |\n| Bohemian Rhapsody | \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" | Queen | 1975 |\n| Jolyne Cujoh | \"Jolene\" | Dolly Parton | 1973 |\n\n#### **Stage 3: Final Selection and Data Retrieval**\n\nIn the final stage, five examples were selected from the verified list to acquire direct Spotify links, intended to provide an accessible, actionable data point for each reference. This stage served to test the feasibility of linking textual references to their direct cultural artifacts via a popular streaming platform.\n\nThe results, documented in Table 5, were mixed. Direct links were successfully located for Queen's \"Killer Queen\" and \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" and a playlist containing Pink Floyd's \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" was identified. However, the initial search queries for Deep Purple's \"Highway Star\" and Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\" returned irrelevant URLs, indicating a limitation in the search process that would require more refined methods for successful retrieval. This outcome underscores the challenges in automated data acquisition and the need for manual verification.\n\n**Table 5: Final Sample with Spotify Link Retrieval Results**\n| Character/Stand | Musical Reference | Artist/Band | Spotify URL |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Crazy Diamond | \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" | Pink Floyd | `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4jMzb2XJsyeDyAvalesdcn` |\n| Killer Queen | \"Killer Queen\" | Queen | `https://open.spotify.com/track/4mKlzy0qaK1c2Qw5e2VqpF` |\n| Highway Star | \"Highway Star\" | Deep Purple | `https://www.definitions.net/definition/DEEP` |\n| Bohemian Rhapsody | \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" | Queen | `https://open.spotify.com/track/6l8GvAyoUZwWDgF1e4822w` |\n| Jolyne Cujoh | \"Jolene\" | Dolly Parton | `https://www.fastweb.com/` |\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### **Literature Review & Theoretical Framework**\n\nThe primary \"literature\" for this investigation consists of community-curated databases, principally the JoJo's Bizarre Encyclopedia, which function as extensive reference archives. The theoretical framework guiding this research is that of intertextuality, wherein the meaning and aesthetic of Araki's work are enriched by a dense web of allusions to external cultural products, specifically Western popular music. These references are not merely nominal but often establish thematic parallels between the source material and the characters' personalities, designs, or abilities, creating a dialogue between the text and a broader cultural history.\n\n#### **Methodology & Data Analysis**\n\nThe research employed a qualitative, three-stage data filtration methodology:\n1.  **Data Compilation:** An exhaustive list of potential musical references was assembled from the established fan-driven encyclopedia. This served as the initial, unrefined dataset.\n2.  **Data Filtration and Verification:** The initial dataset was systematically filtered based on a specific temporal criterion (1970–1979). Each entry was then subjected to a verification process using authoritative databases (e.g., Discogs) to confirm metadata such as artist and release year.\n3.  **Data Point Retrieval:** A representative sample of five verified references was selected. A targeted search was conducted on the Spotify platform to acquire a direct hyperlink to the corresponding musical artifact, testing the feasibility of linking the textual reference to its source.\n\nAnalysis consisted of categorizing the verified data to identify patterns, such as the prevalence of specific artists (e.g., Queen) and genres (e.g., progressive and glam rock).\n\n#### **Critical Discussion**\n\nThe findings confirm that 1970s rock music is a significant source of inspiration for the nomenclature within *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* Parts 4-6. The prevalence of artists like Queen, Pink Floyd, and Deep Purple suggests a specific cultural touchstone for the author. The connection is often more than superficial; for example, the Stand \"Killer Queen\" possesses multiple abilities named after other Queen songs (\"Sheer Heart Attack,\" \"Bites the Dust\"), creating a nested referential structure.\n\nA key limitation emerged during the data retrieval stage (Stage 3). The failure to secure correct Spotify links for \"Highway Star\" and \"Jolene\" through initial searches highlights the potential for error in automated or surface-level data collection. This indicates that while platforms like Spotify are valuable resources, their search algorithms may not always yield precise results without highly specific queries, necessitating a more robust, and often manual, verification protocol in future studies.\n\n#### **Future Research Directions**\n\nThis study provides a methodological foundation for more extensive analysis. Future research could expand this framework to encompass all parts of the *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* saga to conduct a comprehensive chronological and genre-based analysis of Araki's musical allusions over time. Furthermore, a deeper qualitative analysis could explore the diegetic relationship between the musical reference and the narrative function of the character or Stand. Such research would investigate *how* the thematic content, lyrics, or musical style of a song like \"Killer Queen\" or \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" is semiotically encoded into the abilities and personality of its namesake, moving from identification to interpretation.",
