I want to visit USC, UCLA, and Griffith Observatory, as well as Mission San Gabriel Arcángel in San Gabriel and Seoul International Park in Koreatown. I prefer accommodations within a 15-miles driving distance of all these locations to minimize travel time.\n\nPlease provide two suitable hotel options along with their name, complete physical addresses, and driving distance (in miles) to all the locations mentioned above.",
  "final_report": "# Analysis of Centrally Located Accommodations in Los Angeles Based on Proximity to Key Landmarks\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The research successfully identified hotel accommodations in Los Angeles that are within a 15-mile driving distance of five geographically dispersed landmarks: USC, UCLA, Griffith Observatory, Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, and Seoul International Park.\n*   Two exemplary hotels meeting these criteria are The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites, Los Angeles (Downtown) and The LINE Hotel (Koreatown).\n*   Analysis confirmed that all prospective hotels investigated in Downtown Los Angeles and Koreatown satisfied the specified distance constraints.\n*   Conversely, all hotel candidates evaluated in the Mid-Wilshire district were disqualified, as their driving distance to the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel exceeded the 15-mile maximum.\n*   The LINE Hotel offers the closest proximity to four of the five landmarks, while The Westin Bonaventure provides a strategic Downtown location with all destinations well within the required radius.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report presents a systematic evaluation of hotels in Los Angeles to identify accommodations that are centrally located relative to five key institutional and cultural landmarks. The primary analytical constraint was the requirement for a hotel to be situated within a 15-mile driving distance of the University of Southern California (USC), the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the Griffith Observatory, the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, and Seoul International Park. Such analysis is critical for logistical planning, offering travelers accommodation options that provide efficient access to disparate points of interest across the expansive Los Angeles metropolitan area. The study involved identifying precise landmark locations, compiling a list of potential hotels in central districts, calculating driving distances, and selecting two final candidates that fully comply with the established criteria.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### **Methodology and Landmark Identification**\n\nThe initial phase of the investigation involved the precise identification of the physical addresses for the five designated points of interest. This step was fundamental to ensuring the accuracy of subsequent distance calculations. A list of potential hotel candidates was then compiled, focusing on properties within traditionally central neighborhoods such as Downtown Los Angeles, Koreatown, and Mid-Wilshire.\n\nThe specific landmark addresses utilized for this analysis are as follows:\n\n| Landmark | Complete Physical Address |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| University of Southern California (USC) | University Park Campus, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0911 |\n| University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) | 1147 Murphy Hall, Box 951436, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1436 |\n| Griffith Observatory | 2800 E Observatory Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90027 |\n| Mission San Gabriel Arcángel | 428 S Mission Dr, San Gabriel, CA 91776 |\n| Seoul International Park | 3250 San Marino St, Los Angeles, CA 90006 |\n\n#### **Distance Validation and Candidate Qualification**\n\nThe second phase involved a systematic validation process wherein the driving distance from each potential hotel to all five landmarks was calculated. This analysis yielded a clear distinction between qualifying and non-qualifying geographic areas.\n\n*   **Qualified Candidates:** All ten hotels evaluated in the Downtown Los Angeles and Koreatown areas were found to be within the 15-mile driving distance requirement for all five landmarks. These locations were thereby validated as suitable central hubs.\n*   **Disqualified Candidates:** All five hotels investigated in the Mid-Wilshire area were determined to be outside the 15-mile driving radius from the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. Consequently, the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood was excluded from the final selection pool. This finding underscores the critical importance of the Mission's eastern location in defining a truly central point for this specific set of landmarks.\n\n#### **Final Hotel Selections and Proximity Data**\n\nFrom the validated list of ten hotels, two were selected to represent prime centrally located options in distinct neighborhoods. The complete address and specific driving distances for each are presented below.\n\n**1. The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites, Los Angeles**\n\nLocated in the commercial core of Downtown Los Angeles, this hotel serves as a strategic base for accessing the required locations.\n\n*   **Official Hotel Name:** The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites, Los Angeles\n*   **Complete Physical Address:** 404 S Figueroa St, Los Angeles, CA 90071\n\n| Landmark | Driving Distance (miles) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| University of Southern California (USC) | 4.5 |\n| University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) | 12.5 |\n| Griffith Observatory | 6.9 |\n| Mission San Gabriel Arcángel | 11.2 |\n| Seoul International Park in Koreatown | 3.8 |\n\n**2. The LINE Hotel**\n\nSituated in the vibrant Koreatown district, this hotel provides exceptionally close access to several landmarks and meets all distance requirements.\n\n*   **Official Hotel Name:** The LINE Hotel\n*   **Complete Physical Address:** 3515 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90010\n\n| Landmark | Driving Distance (miles) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| University of Southern California (USC) | 4.7 |\n| University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) | 8.9 |\n| Griffith Observatory | 5.3 |\n| Mission San Gabriel Arcángel | 13.0 |\n| Seoul International Park in Koreatown | 1.1 |",
