  "final_report": "# A Quantitative Analysis of Player Field Goal Efficiency for the Boston Celtics in the 2019-2020 NBA Playoffs\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   Four players on the 2019-2020 Boston Celtics playoff roster met the specified performance criteria of a minimum of 10 Field Goal Attempts (FGA) and a Field Goal Percentage (FG%) of 50% or greater.\n*   The qualifying players were Daniel Theis (100 FGA, .520 FG%), Robert Williams (42 FGA, .738 FG%), Enes Kanter (25 FGA, .520 FG%), and Grant Williams (37 FGA, .568 FG%).\n*   Robert Williams exhibited the highest field goal efficiency on the team among all players with at least 10 attempts, converting at a rate of 73.8%.\n*   The team's primary offensive options—Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Kemba Walker—did not meet the 50% FG% threshold despite leading the team in total field goal attempts.\n*   Comprehensive team and player per-game statistics for the 2020 NBA Playoffs are available through the repository Basketball-Reference.com.\n*   The analysis highlights a distinction between high-volume primary scorers and high-efficiency, lower-volume role players within the team's offensive structure.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report provides a detailed statistical analysis of the individual player performances for the Boston Celtics during the 2019-2020 National Basketball Association (NBA) Playoffs. The primary objective is to identify players who achieved a specific benchmark of offensive efficiency, defined as a field goal percentage (FG%) of at least 50% (.500) on a minimum of 10 total field goal attempts (FGA) over the course of the playoff run.\n\nThis investigation utilizes a complete statistical dataset for the entire roster to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. By filtering player performance against these precise criteria, the analysis differentiates between high-volume shooters and highly efficient contributors, offering a nuanced perspective on individual offensive roles and effectiveness during the team's postseason campaign.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### **Methodology and Selection Criteria**\n\nThe analytical framework for this study is predicated on quantitative filtering based on two specific performance metrics from the 2020 NBA Playoffs:\n1.  **Minimum Field Goal Attempts (FGA):** A player must have attempted a minimum of 10 total field goals.\n2.  **Minimum Field Goal Percentage (FG%):** A player must have achieved a shooting percentage of .500 or greater.\n\nData was compiled for all 16 players on the Boston Celtics' 2019-2020 playoff roster to form a complete dataset for the evaluation.\n\n#### **Players Meeting Performance Benchmarks**\n\nApplication of the specified criteria to the roster's playoff statistics yielded four players who met or exceeded the performance benchmarks. These individuals are detailed in the table below.\n\n| Player | FGA | FG% |\n| :--- | :-- | :--- |\n| Daniel Theis | 100 | .520 |\n| Robert Williams | 42 | .738 |\n| Grant Williams | 37 | .568 |\n| Enes Kanter | 25 | .520 |\n\nAmong this qualifying cohort, Robert Williams's performance is particularly noteworthy, as his .738 FG% was substantially higher than that of any other player on the roster with a significant number of attempts. Daniel Theis, as a starting center, also demonstrated high efficiency across a much larger volume of 100 attempts. Both Grant Williams and Enes Kanter provided efficient scoring in their respective roles off the bench.\n\n#### **Comprehensive Roster Statistical Overview**\n\nFor contextual purposes, the complete statistical data for all players on the 2019-2020 playoff roster is presented below. This table illustrates the performance distribution across the entire team and highlights the contrast between the high-volume, sub-50% primary scorers and the low-volume, high-efficiency players identified above.\n\n| Player | FGA | FG% |\n| :--- | :-- | :--- |\n| Jayson Tatum | 345 | .435 |\n| Jaylen Brown | 282 | .475 |\n| Kemba Walker | 247 | .441 |\n| Marcus Smart | 193 | .394 |\n| Gordon Hayward | 88 | .409 |\n| Daniel Theis | 100 | .520 |\n| Brad Wanamaker | 81 | .481 |\n| Robert Williams | 42 | .738 |\n| Grant Williams | 37 | .568 |\n| Enes Kanter | 25 | .520 |\n| Semi Ojeleye | 36 | .278 |\n| Romeo Langford | 8 | .500 |\n| Vincent Poirier | 2 | .500 |\n| Tacko Fall | 4 | .750 |\n| Carsen Edwards | 3 | .333 |\n| Tremont Waters | 3 | .333 |\n\nAs evidenced by the data, the team's leading scorers in terms of volume—Tatum, Brown, and Walker—all recorded field goal percentages below the .500 threshold. This finding is not unexpected, as primary perimeter scorers often take a higher proportion of difficult, contested, and long-range shots compared to interior players, which tends to depress overall field goal percentage.\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### **Literature Review & Theoretical Framework**\n\nThe use of Field Goal Percentage (FG%) as a metric for offensive efficiency is foundational in basketball analytics. While widely used, it is considered a traditional statistic. Contemporary basketball scholarship, often termed \"sabermetrics,\" typically favors more advanced metrics like Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%), which accounts for the added value of three-point field goals, and True Shooting Percentage (TS%), which incorporates free throws. However, FG% remains a valid and accessible indicator of scoring efficiency from the floor.\n\n#### **Methodology & Data Analysis**\n\nThe methodology employed in this report is a straightforward quantitative filtering process. A complete dataset for the 2019-2020 Boston Celtics playoff roster was sourced from the reputable sports statistics database, Basketball-Reference.com. The analysis involved the direct application of two numerical constraints (FGA ≥ 10, FG% ≥ .500) to isolate a specific subset of players from the population. The approach is transparent, replicable, and grounded entirely in the provided empirical data.\n\n#### **Critical Discussion**\n\nA primary limitation of this analysis is its reliance on FG% as the sole metric of efficiency. This measure does not differentiate between two-point and three-point shots, treating all made baskets equally. Consequently, a player with a high volume of three-point attempts (e.g., Marcus Smart, 193 FGA at .394 FG%) may appear less efficient than a player who scores primarily at the rim (e.g., Robert Williams, 42 FGA at .738 FG%), even if their overall contribution to scoring is comparable when weighted for shot value. The minimum threshold of 10 FGA is also an arbitrary cutoff that influences the results; for instance, Romeo Langford (8 FGA, .500 FG%) narrowly missed inclusion.\n\n#### **Future Research Directions**\n\nFuture research could build upon this analysis by employing more sophisticated efficiency metrics. An investigation using eFG% and TS% would provide a more complete picture of each player's scoring contribution. Further studies could also expand the scope to include defensive metrics, rebounding rates, and playmaking statistics (e.g., assist-to-turnover ratio) to construct a more holistic model of a player's overall on-court value during the playoff series.",
