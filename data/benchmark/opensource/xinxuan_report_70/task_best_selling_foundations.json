The competitive landscape of the beauty industry necessitates a clear understanding of which products achieve significant market penetration and consumer preference. The initial phase of this research involved identifying five distinct, leading foundations based on an analysis of reputable industry-focused publications.\n\nFollowing the identification of these marquee products, the research expanded to examine the broader product ecosystems of the associated brands. For each of the five selected foundations, a corresponding concealer and highlighter were located on the brand's official website. This report compiles and presents the direct product URLs for all 15 items, offering a precise and verifiable reference for these core complexion products. The resulting dataset provides valuable insights for market analysis, competitive intelligence, and consumer research.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### Identification of Top-Selling Foundations\n\nAn examination of reputable beauty industry publications and articles discussing top-selling products at Sephora has yielded a definitive list of five leading foundations from distinct brands. The ranking is inferred from sources that highlight their popularity, sales performance, and iconic status. The Anastasia Beverly Hills foundation is particularly notable for being designated the top new beauty launch of 2025.\n\nThe identified top five best-selling foundations are:\n\n1.  **Anastasia Beverly Hills** - Impeccable Blurring Second-Skin Matte Foundation\n2.  **Fenty Beauty by Rihanna** - Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Longwear Liquid Foundation\n3.  **Make Up For Ever** - HD Skin Undetectable Longwear Foundation\n4.  **Dior** - Backstage Face & Body Foundation\n5.  **Armani Beauty** - Luminous Silk Foundation\n\n#### Compilation of Complementary Product Suites\n\nTo provide a more holistic view of each brand's complexion offerings, a corresponding concealer and highlighter were identified for each of the top-selling foundations.

This collection facilitates direct access to product specifications and illustrates the brand's approach to a complete face makeup suite.\n\n| Brand | Best-Selling Foundation | Corresponding Concealer | Corresponding Highlighter |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Anastasia Beverly Hills** | [Impeccable Blurring Second-Skin Matte Foundation](https://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/impeccable-blurring-second-skin-matte-foundation.html) | [Magic Touch Concealer](https://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/products/magic-touch-concealer) | [Sugar Glow Kit](https://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/products/sugar-glow-kit) |\n| **Fenty Beauty by Rihanna** | [Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Longwear Liquid Foundation](https://fentybeauty.com/products/pro-filtr-soft-matte-longwear-foundation-100-for-very-fair-skin-w-neutral-undertones) | [Pro Filt’r Instant Retouch Longwear Liquid Concealer](https://fentybeauty.com/products/pro-filtr-instant-retouch-concealer-100) | [Killawatt Freestyle Highlighter](https://fentybeauty.com/products/killawatt-freestyle-highlighter-mean-money-hu-tla-baby) |\n| **Make Up For Ever** | [HD Skin Undetectable Longwear Foundation](https://www.makeupforever.com/us/en/face/foundation/hd-skin-foundation-MI000042400.html) | [HD Skin Concealer](https://www.makeupforever.com/us/en/face/concealer/hd-skin-concealer-MI000042480.html) | [Artist Face Powders Highlighter](https://www.makeupforever.com/us/en/face/blush/artist-face-powders-highlighter-MI000042407.html) |\n| **Dior** | [Backstage Face & Body Foundation](https://www.dior.com/en_us/beauty/products/dior-backstage-face-body-foundation-Y0028001.html) | [Dior Forever Skin Correct Concealer](https://www.dior.com/en_us/beauty/products/Y0096000-dior-forever-skin-correct-concealer-24h-wear-crease-proof-full-coverage-creamy-concealer.html) | [Dior Forever Couture Luminizer](https://www.dior.com/en_us/beauty/products/Y0202000-dior-forever-couture-luminizer-dioriviera-limited-edition-long-wear-highlighter.html) |\n| **Armani Beauty** | [Luminous Silk Foundation](https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/foundation/liquid-foundation/luminous-silk-foundation/A041.html) | [Luminous Silk Concealer](https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face/concealer/luminous-silk-concealer/A2266.html) | [Luminous Silk Glow Highlighter](https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face-makeup/highlighter/luminous-silk-glow-highlighter/WW-00062-ARM.html) |\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### Methodology & Data Analysis\n\nThe research methodology for this report was executed in a multi-stage process designed to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n\n1.  **Best-Seller Identification**: The initial stage involved a synthesis of data from secondary sources, specifically reputable publications covering the beauty industry and consumer trends. Articles discussing top-selling and high-demand products at Sephora US were analyzed to derive a ranked list of five foundations from distinct, leading brands.\n2.  **Product Data Collection**: The second stage consisted of a systematic verification and data collection process. For each of the five identified brands, their official US e-commerce website was navigated to locate the exact best-selling foundation product. Subsequently, a search was conducted on each site to identify one representative concealer and one representative highlighter product.\n3.  **Data Compilation**: The final stage involved the compilation of all gathered information, including specific product names and direct Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), into a structured format for clear analysis and presentation.\n\n#### Critical Discussion\n\nThe findings successfully present a curated list of market-leading products. However, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The initial list of \"best-selling\" foundations is predicated on an analysis of media reports and not on proprietary sales data directly from Sephora. Therefore, the ranking should be considered an informed inference rather than an absolute quantitative measure. Furthermore, the selection of the complementary concealer and highlighter for each brand was based on availability and apparent product synergy on the official websites; these may not necessarily represent the best-selling items within their respective categories for each brand. The research provides a robust snapshot of core product offerings from these key market players.",
