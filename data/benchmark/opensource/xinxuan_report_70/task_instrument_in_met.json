  "final_report": "# An Examination of Select East Asian Chordophones in the Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The research successfully identified five distinct East Asian string instruments (chordophones) from the 19th century or earlier within the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n*   The selected instruments originate from a diverse range of cultures, including Japan (Koto, Shamisen), China (Pipa), Korea (Chongak Kayagum), and Tibet (Dran-nye).\n*   All five specified instruments are confirmed to be currently on public view at The Met Fifth Avenue, primarily within Galleries 681 and 684.\n*   The collection pieces span a notable chronological range, from an early 17th-century Japanese Koto to several examples from the 19th century.\n*   The instruments represent a variety of construction types, including zithers (Koto, Kayagum) and lutes (Shamisen, Pipa, Dran-nye), illustrating different musical traditions and organological classifications.\n*   Direct access to the museum's digital records for each artifact has been verified, providing scholarly and public access to detailed information.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report presents a focused analysis of five East Asian string instruments housed in the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The objective is to document specific examples dating from the 19th century or earlier that are currently accessible to the public. The selected artifacts—a Koto, Shamisen, Pipa, Chongak Kayagum, and Dran-nye—provide a cross-section of the rich musical heritage of Japan, China, Korea, and Tibet.\n\nThe study confirms the provenance, date of creation, and display status for each instrument, drawing exclusively from the museum's official collection data. By examining these chordophones, the report highlights the diversity in form, function, and cultural significance of musical arts across East Asia during the pre-modern and early modern eras. The findings underscore the museum's role as a repository for significant cultural objects and provide a foundational reference for these specific items.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe investigation identified a representative sample of East Asian chordophones meeting the specified criteria. The primary data for these five instruments are systematically presented below, followed by brief analytical descriptions of each artifact's unique characteristics and cultural context.\n\n#### Comparative Instrument Data\n\nThe following table synthesizes the essential information for each of the five selected instruments, facilitating a comparative overview of their origins, chronology, and classification.\n\n| Instrument | Common Name | Origin | Date | Type |\n|------------|-------------|--------|------|------|\n| Koto (箏) | Koto | Japan | Early 17th century | Zither |\n| Shamisen (三味線) | Shamisen | Japan | ca. 1880 | Lute |\n| Pipa (琵琶) | Pipa | China | 19th century | Lute |\n| Chongak Kayagum (정악 가야금) | Kayagum | Korea | 19th century | Zither |\n| Dran-nye (sgra-snyan) | Dran-nye | Tibet | 19th century | Lute |\n\n#### Instrument Descriptions\n\n**1. Koto (箏)**\nThis early 17th-century Japanese zither is a noteworthy example from the Edo period. Its artistic value is significantly enhanced by intricate metalwork attributed to the celebrated artist Goto Teijo. The extensive use of inlay across the instrument's body suggests it was created for an owner of high social standing. The Koto is a long zither with thirteen strings, which are plucked using plectra worn on the fingers. It is currently displayed in Gallery 684.\n\n**2. Shamisen (三味線)**\nOriginating from Japan around 1880, this three-stringed lute is characteristic of an instrument type that gained prominence during the Edo period (1615–1868). The Shamisen is defined by its long, unfretted neck and a small, box-shaped body traditionally covered with skin. Its versatility allowed for its use in a wide array of cultural contexts, including puppet theater (Bunraku), folk traditions, and refined artistic performances. It is on view in Gallery 681.\n\n**3. Pipa (琵琶)**\nThis 19th-century Chinese lute features the classic pear-shaped body and a fretted neck characteristic of the Pipa. The instrument under examination is constructed of wood, with ivory utilized for the frets and tuning pegs. With a history in China spanning over two millennia, the Pipa holds a significant place in both imperial court music and diverse regional folk genres. This four-stringed instrument is on display in Gallery 681.\n\n**4. Chongak Kayagum (정악 가야금)**\nThis Korean zither from the 19th century is an exemplar of the Chongak Kayagum. It possesses twelve silk strings, each supported by a movable bridge that allows for fine-tuning. The term \"chongak\" translates to \"proper music,\" signifying its association with the sophisticated musical traditions of the Joseon dynasty's educated elite. The instrument's body is crafted from paulownia wood. It can be found in Gallery 681.\n\n**5. Dran-nye (sgra-snyan)**\nA Himalayan long-necked lute from 19th-century Tibet, the Dran-nye is typically unfretted and used in secular contexts to accompany song and dance. This particular seven-stringed specimen is considered a fine example from central Tibet. Its construction and function distinguish it from the sacred musical traditions of the region, situating it within the realm of popular entertainment and cultural celebration. This instrument is also exhibited in Gallery 681.",
