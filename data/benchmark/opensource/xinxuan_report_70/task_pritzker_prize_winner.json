  "final_report": "# An Examination of the 2025 Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureate, Liu Jiakun, and His Selected Works\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   Liu Jiakun has been officially named the 2025 Laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize.\n*   His highest academic qualification is a Bachelor of Engineering in Architecture, which he received in 1982.\n*   The degree was conferred by the Institute of Architecture and Engineering in Chongqing, which is now known as Chongqing University.\n*   The Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum (2002) in Chengdu is a seminal project that garnered him international attention for its integration of architecture with the natural landscape.\n*   West Village (2015), also in Chengdu, exemplifies his approach to large-scale, mixed-use urban developments designed to foster public engagement and community.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report provides a scholarly examination of the 2025 Pritzker Architecture Prize laureate, Liu Jiakun. The analysis confirms his selection as the recipient of this distinguished award and details his formal educational background. Furthermore, it presents a detailed investigation of two significant projects from his portfolio: the Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum and the West Village urban development.\n\nThe selection of Liu Jiakun underscores a focus on architecture that is deeply rooted in its social and cultural context, responding to the complexities of urban life with designs that prioritize human experience and community interaction. This report synthesizes available information to delineate the foundational elements of his career and the core principles manifest in his architectural work.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### Laureate Identification and Educational Background\n\nThe investigation confirms that Liu Jiakun is the designated 2025 Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureate. His formal architectural training culminated in a Bachelor of Engineering in Architecture, which he completed in 1982. The conferring institution was the Institute of Architecture and Engineering in Chongqing, an entity that has since been restructured and renamed Chongqing University. This foundational education provided the basis for a career characterized by a thoughtful and contextually sensitive design philosophy.\n\n#### Analysis of Selected Works\n\nAn analysis of Liu Jiakun's portfolio reveals a consistent focus on creating spaces that serve societal needs while maintaining a strong connection to local culture and landscape. Two projects, in particular, illustrate the evolution and application of his architectural principles: one a culturally significant museum and the other a large-scale urban intervention.\n\n| Project | Location | Completion Year | Key Architectural Features & Significance |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum** | Chengdu, People's Republic of China | 2002 | Integrates with the natural landscape, emulating a traditional Chinese garden. Balances elements of water and ancient stones to create a serene, contemplative space. An early work that brought Liu international recognition. |\n| **West Village** | Chengdu, People's Republic of China | 2015 | A large-scale, mixed-use development designed as an \"urban living room.\" Features sloping pedestrian and cyclist pathways encircling an interior courtyard. Fosters community by integrating cultural, athletic, and commercial activities in an open, public-facing design. |\n\n##### **Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum (2002)**\n\nCompleted in 2002 in Chengdu, the Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum represents a formative project in Liu Jiakun's career. The structure houses Buddhist sculptures and relics, and its design is conceived to function as a contemporary interpretation of a traditional Chinese garden. The architectural composition thoughtfully juxtaposes water features and ancient stones, reflecting and integrating with the surrounding natural environment. This project was instrumental in establishing Liu's international reputation, showcasing a design ethos that prioritizes serenity, contemplation, and a harmonious relationship between the built form and its landscape.\n\n\n![Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum](https://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/Issues/2025/04-April/Luyeyuan-Stone-Sculpture-Art-Museum.webp)\n\n\n##### **West Village (2015)**\n\nThe West Village project, finalized in 2015, demonstrates Liu Jiakun's architectural approach on a significant urban scale. Occupying an entire city block in Chengdu, this development is a multi-functional complex that amalgamates cultural, athletic, recreational, and commercial uses. A defining feature is its perimeter of sloped pathways for pedestrians and cyclists, which encloses a vibrant interior courtyard. This design fosters a strong sense of community and public space within a dense urban fabric, creating what has been termed an \"urban living room.\" West Village serves as a prime example of Liu's capacity to design architecture that is activated by public life and successfully balances the diverse needs of contemporary society.\n\n\n![West Village](https://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/Issues/2025/04-April/West-Village.webp)",
