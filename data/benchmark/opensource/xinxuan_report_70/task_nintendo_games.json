  "final_report": "# An Analysis of the Top Ten Best-Selling Non-Pokémon Titles on the Nintendo Switch Platform\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   ***Mario Kart 8 Deluxe*** is the highest-selling title on the Nintendo Switch, excluding Pokémon games, with 68.20 million units sold as of March 31, 2025.\n*   Nintendo's first-party intellectual properties, particularly the *Mario* and *The Legend of Zelda* franchises, dominate the top-seller list, accounting for eight of the ten positions.\n*   The majority of these top-selling titles have achieved exceptional critical acclaim, with seven of the ten games holding a Metascore of 90 or higher.\n*   A notable disparity exists between professional critic scores (Metascore) and audience reception (User Score) for certain titles, such as *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* and *Super Mario Party*.\n*   Pricing for these premium titles is largely standardized at $59.99, with *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* priced higher at $69.99, suggesting a new tier for major releases.\n*   The data reflects the commercial strength of established \"evergreen\" titles, many of which were released early in the console's lifecycle yet continue to exhibit strong sales performance.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report presents a systematic analysis of the ten best-selling video games for the Nintendo Switch console, with the specific exclusion of titles from the *Pokémon* franchise. The objective is to provide a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the commercial success, critical reception, and market positioning of the platform's most influential software. Data for this analysis has been aggregated from three primary sources: sales figures as of March 31, 2025, were sourced from Wikipedia's compilation of official Nintendo sales data; pricing and purchase information were obtained from the official Nintendo US eShop; and critical and user review scores were collated from Metacritic. This multi-faceted approach allows for a comprehensive examination of the factors contributing to the enduring market dominance of Nintendo's key software properties.\n\nThe findings underscore the strategic importance of first-party exclusive titles in driving the commercial success of the Nintendo Switch platform. The analysis reveals a landscape dominated by well-established franchises, indicating a consumer base that prioritizes familiar characters and gameplay experiences. Furthermore, by juxtaposing sales data with critical and user reception metrics, this report illuminates complex relationships between commercial performance, critical acclaim, and player satisfaction.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### Sales Performance and Market Dominance\n\nThe commercial performance of the top-selling non-Pokémon titles on the Nintendo Switch platform is characterized by the profound dominance of first-party Nintendo software. As detailed in the table below, the list is exclusively composed of titles developed or published by Nintendo, highlighting the company's successful vertical integration strategy.\n\n| Rank | Title | Copies Sold (in millions) |\n|:----:|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------:|\n| 1 | *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* | 68.20 |\n| 2 | *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* | 47.82 |\n| 3 | *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* | 36.24 |\n| 4 | *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* | 32.81 |\n| 5 | *Super Mario Odyssey* | 29.28 |\n| 6 | *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* | 21.73 |\n| 7 | *Super Mario Party* | 21.16 |\n| 8 | *New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe* | 18.25 |\n| 9 | *Nintendo Switch Sports* | 16.27 |\n| 10 | *Super Mario Bros. Wonder* | 16.03 |\n\n***Mario Kart 8 Deluxe*** stands as a significant outlier, having sold over 20 million more copies than the next best-selling title, *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*. This demonstrates its position as a quintessential \"evergreen\" title and a system-seller for the platform. The *Mario* franchise, in its various forms (*Kart*, *Odyssey*, *Party*, *Bros.*), occupies five positions on the list, while *The Legend of Zelda* franchise holds two. This concentration indicates the immense brand equity and enduring appeal of Nintendo's core intellectual properties.\n\n#### Critical and User Reception Analysis\n\nThe commercial success of these titles is largely correlated with high critical acclaim. An examination of Metacritic scores reveals that the vast majority of these games are considered landmark achievements by professional critics.\n\n| Rank | Title | Metascore | User Score |\n|:----:|:------------------------------------------|:---------:|:----------:|\n| 1 | *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* | 92 | 8.5 |\n| 2 | *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* | 90 | 5.8 |\n| 3 | *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* | 93 | 8.5 |\n| 4 | *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* | 97 | 8.7 |\n| 5 | *Super Mario Odyssey* | 97 | 9.0 |\n| 6 | *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* | 96 | 8.3 |\n| 7 | *Super Mario Party* | 76 | 4.1 |\n| 8 | *New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe* | 80 | 7.4 |\n| 9 | *Nintendo Switch Sports* | 72 | 4.6 |\n| 10 | *Super Mario Bros. Wonder* | 92 | 8.9 |\n\n*The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* and *Super Mario Odyssey* share the highest Metascore of 97, positioning them among the most critically acclaimed games of all time. Seven of the ten titles achieved a Metascore of 90 or above, indicating a \"universal acclaim\" status.\n\nA noteworthy finding is the significant divergence between Metascores and User Scores for several titles. ***Animal Crossing: New Horizons*** (90 vs. 5.8), ***Super Mario Party*** (76 vs. 4.1), and ***Nintendo Switch Sports*** (72 vs. 4.6) exhibit the most pronounced discrepancies. This suggests that while these games were well-received by critics, segments of the player base expressed dissatisfaction, which could be attributed to factors such as perceived lack of content, post-launch support, or specific design decisions not fully captured in professional reviews.\n\n#### Pricing and Commercial Strategy\n\nNintendo maintains a premium pricing model for its flagship software, a strategy substantiated by the sales data. The standard price point for the majority of these top-tier games on the US eShop is $59.99.\n\n| Rank | Title | Price (USD) | Purchase URL |\n|:----:|:------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* | $59.99 | [Link](https://mariokart8.nintendo.com/) |\n| 2 | *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* | $59.99 | [Link](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/) |\n| 3 | *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* | $59.99 | [Link](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-smash-bros-ultimate-switch/) |\n| 4 | *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* | $59.99 | [Link](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch/) |\n| 5 | *Super Mario Odyssey* | $59.99 | [Link](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-odyssey-switch/) |\n| 6 | *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* | $69.99 | [Link](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch/) |\n| 7 | *Super Mario Party* | $59.99 | [Link](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-party-switch/) |\n| 8 | *New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe* | $59.99 | [Link](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-switch/) |\n| 9 | *Nintendo Switch Sports* | $39.99 (Digital) / $49.99 (Physical) | [Link](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-sports-switch/) |\n| 10 | *Super Mario Bros. Wonder* | $59.99 | [Link](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch/) |\n\nTwo exceptions to this standard are particularly significant. The 2023 release, ***The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom***, was introduced at a higher price of $69.99, signaling a potential shift in pricing strategy for major, new AAA titles on the platform. Conversely, ***Nintendo Switch Sports*** is offered at a lower price point, with a digital version at $39.99 and a physical version (which includes a leg strap accessory) at $49.99. This differentiated pricing likely reflects the game's positioning as a more casual, family-oriented title reminiscent of its predecessor, *Wii Sports*.\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### Literature Review & Theoretical Framework\n\nThe findings of this report align with established theoretical frameworks regarding platform ecosystems in the video game industry. The concept of **\"platform-defining software\"** or \"killer apps\" is central to understanding the success of a console. The data clearly indicates that titles like *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* and *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* function in this capacity for the Nintendo Switch. Furthermore, the commercial longevity of these titles exemplifies the economic principle of **\"evergreen\" products**, which maintain steady demand long after their initial release, driven by a continuous influx of new hardware owners. Nintendo's strategy of leveraging a portfolio of powerful, internally-owned Intellectual Properties (IPs) is a classic example of successful vertical integration and brand management, creating a closed ecosystem that drives both hardware and software sales.\n\n#### Methodology & Data Analysis\n\nThe research methodology for this report involved a multi-source data aggregation and comparative analysis.\n1.  **Sales Data Collection**: Sales figures were sourced from the Wikipedia article \"List of best-selling Nintendo Switch video games,\" which compiles officially reported data from Nintendo. The data is current as of Nintendo's fiscal reporting period ending March 31, 2025. A filter was applied to exclude all titles belonging to the *Pokémon* franchise.\n2.  **Pricing Data Collection**: Retail prices and purchase links were sourced directly from the official Nintendo of America website for the US eShop, ensuring accuracy at the time of the report.\n3.  **Review Score Collection**: Critic (Metascore) and user (User Score) data were collected from the aggregation website Metacritic on August 8, 2025.\nThe analytical approach was primarily quantitative and comparative, cross-referencing sales rankings with reception scores and pricing to identify trends and anomalies. A key limitation of this methodology is its reliance on publicly available, periodically updated sales data; real-time sales figures are not available. Additionally, Metacritic User Scores can be subject to review bombing and may not always represent a statistically balanced sample of the entire player base.\n\n#### Critical Discussion\n\nThe synthesis of sales, review, and pricing data reveals a robust but complex picture of success on the Nintendo Switch. The commercial dominance of Nintendo's first-party IPs is unequivocal. This strategy insulates Nintendo from direct competition with third-party publishers on other platforms and creates a unique value proposition for its hardware. However, the disconnect between critical and user scores for certain high-selling titles like *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* and *Super Mario Party* warrants critical consideration. This schism suggests that while a title can be a commercial and critical success, it may not fully meet the long-term expectations of its dedicated player community. This phenomenon could be a function of post-launch content roadmaps, online functionality, or core gameplay loops that become sources of friction for engaged players over time. The pricing structure further reinforces Nintendo's premium brand positioning, demonstrating a confidence that the quality and brand recognition of its software command a high market value, largely independent of competitor pricing.\n\n#### Future Research Directions\n\nThis report provides a foundation for several potential avenues of future research.\n1.  **Qualitative Analysis of User Reviews**: A qualitative, thematic analysis of the user reviews for games with significant Metascore/User Score discrepancies could provide nuanced insights into the specific drivers of player dissatisfaction.\n2.  **Longitudinal Sales Analysis**: A long-term study tracking the sales trajectory of these evergreen titles in relation to price promotions, DLC releases, and console lifecycle milestones could offer a deeper understanding of their sustained commercial performance.\n3.  **Comparative Franchise Analysis**: A more in-depth study comparing the performance, design evolution, and reception of the *Mario* and *The Legend of Zelda* franchises on the Switch could yield valuable conclusions about successful IP management and innovation within established series.",
