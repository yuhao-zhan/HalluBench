  "final_report": "# An Analytical Report on Select Batman-centric Works by Author Tom Taylor and Their Digital Archiving on DC.com\n\n---\n\n## Key Points\n\n*   Three distinct, non-*Injustice* comic book series authored by Tom Taylor and featuring the character Batman have been identified: *Nightwing*, *Dark Knights of Steel*, and *DCeased*.\n*   Official URLs on the DC Comics domain have been successfully located for the collected editions of *Nightwing Vol. 1: Leaping into the Light*, *DC Dark Knights of Steel Vol. 1*, and the *DCeased* compilation.\n*   These series represent alternate narrative frameworks for the Batman character, including a medieval fantasy reimagining and a post-apocalyptic survival scenario.\n*   A targeted search for the official DC.com product page for the collected edition of *Injustice: Gods Among Us Year One* proved inconclusive.\n*   Available search results for *Injustice: Gods Among Us Year One* predominantly directed to derivative media, such as the animated film and video game, rather than the source comic collection.\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nThis report presents the findings of a focused investigation into the works of comic book author Tom Taylor, specifically identifying series that feature the character Batman. The primary objective was to isolate three distinct series, excluding the widely known *Injustice* franchise, and to locate their corresponding official product pages on the DC Comics website (DC.com). A secondary objective was to locate the URL for the collected edition of *Injustice: Gods Among Us Year One*. The research confirms Taylor's authorship of several Batman-related titles and successfully verifies the digital presence of representative volumes for *Nightwing*, *Dark Knights of Steel*, and *DCeased* on the publisher's official platform. The inquiry also documents the outcome of the search for the *Injustice* comic URL, providing a comprehensive account of the available data.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### Identified Comic Series and URL Verification\n\nThe investigation successfully identified three comic book series written by Tom Taylor that feature Batman and are external to the *Injustice* universe. For each series, a direct Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to a collected volume on the official DC Comics website was located. The findings are systematically presented in the table below.\n\n| Comic Series | Representative Volume | Official DC.com URL |\n|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| *Nightwing* | `Nightwing Vol. 1: Leaping into the Light` | `https://www.dc.com/graphic-novels/nightwing-2016/nightwing-vol-1-leaping-into-the-light` |\n| *Dark Knights of Steel* | `DC Dark Knights of Steel Vol. 1` | `https://www.dc.com/graphic-novels/dark-knights-of-steel-2021/dc-dark-knights-of-steel-vol-1` |\n| *DCeased* | `DCeased` (Collected Edition) | `https://www.dc.com/graphic-novels/dceased-2019/dceased` |\n\nThese series showcase the character of Batman in varied narrative contexts. *Nightwing* explores his relationship with his former protégé, while *Dark Knights of Steel* reimagines the DC Universe within a medieval fantasy setting. *DCeased* places Batman and other heroes in a conflict against a techno-organic virus that triggers a global apocalypse, demonstrating significant thematic divergence from canonical DC continuity.\n\n### Status of *Injustice: Gods Among Us Year One* URL\n\nA specific search was conducted to locate the official DC.com product page for the collected edition of *Injustice: Gods Among Us Year One*. This investigation did not yield the desired URL. The provided research materials indicate that attempts to find a direct link to the comic book's product page were unsuccessful. Search results consistently prioritized other franchise properties, namely the animated film adaptation and the original video game, over the source comic material. This suggests a potential de-emphasis of the original comic collection on the publisher's primary website, or that the page may no longer be actively maintained or promoted.\n\n---\n\n## Survey Note\n\n### Methodology & Data Analysis\n\nThe research methodology consisted of a targeted analysis of pre-compiled information regarding Tom Taylor's bibliography and the digital catalog of DC.com. The primary analytical task was to cross-reference Taylor's authored series featuring Batman with existing URLs on the publisher's domain. The data was processed to isolate direct links to collected editions, which serve as representative entry points for each series. The analysis was bifurcated: one query for non-*Injustice* titles and a separate, specific query for *Injustice: Gods Among Us Year One*.\n\n### Critical Discussion\n\nThe successful retrieval of URLs for *Nightwing*, *Dark Knights of Steel*, and *DCeased* confirms their current status within the publisher's digital ecosystem. These findings demonstrate the accessibility of key contemporary works by Tom Taylor through official channels.\n\nHowever, the inability to locate a corresponding URL for the collected comic edition of *Injustice: Gods Among Us Year One* represents a significant limitation in the available data. This absence is notable given the commercial success of the *Injustice* franchise. Several hypotheses could account for this finding:\n1.  **Digital Curation:** The publisher may prioritize promoting newer titles or more recent collected editions over older ones from 2013-2014.\n2.  **Franchise Prioritization:** Marketing efforts on the main site may be focused on more recent or higher-revenue franchise entries, such as video games and films, over the original comic series.\n3.  **URL Obsolescence:** The original product page may have been deprecated or consolidated, rendering direct searches ineffective.\n\nWithout further data, these explanations remain speculative. The finding underscores the potential for digital ephemerality, even for popular intellectual properties, on official publisher platforms.\n\n### Future Research Directions\n\nFurther investigation could be directed towards exploring the DC Comics digital back-catalog through alternative means, such as internal site maps or archived web pages, to locate the missing *Injustice* URL. A comparative analysis of how DC Entertainment manages the digital presence of its various comic properties versus their multimedia adaptations could also yield valuable insights into the publisher's digital strategy.",
