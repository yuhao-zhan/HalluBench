  "final_report": "# An Analytical Report on Upcoming NASA Launch Events and Crew Manifests\n\n---\n\n## Key Points\n\n*   The official NASA \"Events\" webpage serves as the primary and authoritative source for the agency's comprehensive upcoming launch schedule.\n*   The launch manifest reveals a mixed portfolio of missions, including flagship scientific endeavors (e.g., IMAP, Roman Space Telescope) and commercially partnered flights under initiatives like the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS).\n*   A significant portion of forthcoming missions are uncrewed, focusing on robotic exploration, technology demonstration (e.g., X-59), and payload delivery to the Moon.\n*   The crew for the Artemis II mission has been officially announced and comprises three American astronauts and one Canadian astronaut, highlighting international collaboration.\n*   Crew manifests for subsequent crewed missions, specifically Artemis III and NASA’s Boeing Starliner-1, have not yet been publicly released by the agency.\n*   Systematic research of the NASA website allows for the clear distinction between crewed and uncrewed missions, although specific mission pages for some commercial flights may not be centrally indexed.\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is engaged in a dynamic and multifaceted era of space exploration, characterized by both government-led missions and burgeoning commercial partnerships. This report presents the findings of a systematic investigation into NASA's publicly available schedule of upcoming launch events and the associated crew manifests. The research methodology involved a sequential process of identifying the official launch schedule, compiling mission-specific details, and conducting targeted searches for crew assignments for all designated crewed flights.\n\nThe objective of this analysis is to provide a structured and verified overview of NASA's near-to-mid-term launch activities, distinguishing between scientific, technological, and human spaceflight missions. The findings underscore the transparency of NASA's launch planning while also delineating the phased approach to releasing sensitive information, such as crew assignments, which are typically confirmed closer to mission launch dates. This report synthesizes the collected data into a coherent framework for academic and public reference.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### Identification and Composition of the Official Launch Manifest\n\nThe foundational step of the research process was the identification of an authoritative source for launch information. The official NASA website hosts a dedicated \"Events\" page that functions as the centralized and comprehensive schedule for all upcoming agency-related launches. This resource provides a clear manifest of missions with their designated target launch windows. The schedule indicates a diverse range of activities planned from 2025 through 2028.\n\nThe identified upcoming missions are presented in the table below.\n\n| Mission | Target Launch Date |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| IMAP (Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe) | No Earlier Than September 2025 |\n| CLPS Flight: Blue Origin’s Blue Moon Mark 1 | October 2025 |\n| CLPS Flight: Astrobotic’s Griffin Mission One | 2025 |\n| Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser | 2025 |\n| X-59 First Flight | 2025 |\n| Artemis II | April 2026 |\n| CLPS Flight: Intuitive Machines’ IM-3 | 2026 |\n| CLPS Flight: Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 2 | 2026 |\n| NASA’s Boeing Starliner-1 | 2026 |\n| Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope | No Later Than May 2027 |\n| Artemis III | 2027 |\n| CLPS Flight: Intuitive Machines’ IM-4 | 2027 |\n| CLPS Flight: Draper | 2027 |\n| CLPS Flight: Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 3 | 2028 |\n\n### Mission Classification and Data Compilation\n\nSubsequent analysis involved iterating through the established launch manifest to classify each mission and locate its corresponding official webpage. Each mission was categorized as either \"Crewed\" or \"Uncrewed.\" The findings indicate that the majority of upcoming missions are uncrewed, focusing on scientific discovery and commercial payload delivery under the CLPS program.\n\nA detailed compilation of these missions is provided below. It should be noted that while a direct NASA mission page for Blue Origin's CLPS flight was not located during the research phase, its uncrewed status is determined by the programmatic goals of the CLPS initiative.\n\n| Mission Name | Crew Status | Official Mission URL |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **IMAP** | Uncrewed | [civspace.jhuapl.edu](https://civspace.jhuapl.edu/destinations/missions/imap) |\n| **CLPS: Blue Origin**| Uncrewed | Information not provided |\n| **CLPS: Astrobotic**| Uncrewed | Information not provided |\n| **Sierra Space DC** | Uncrewed | Information not provided |\n| **X-59 First Flight**| Uncrewed | Information not provided |\n| **Artemis II** | Crewed | Information not provided |\n| **CLPS: IM-3** | Uncrewed | Information not provided |\n| **CLPS: Firefly M2**| Uncrewed | Information not provided |\n| **Starliner-1** | Crewed | Information not provided |\n| **Roman Telescope** | Uncrewed | Information not provided |\n| **Artemis III** | Crewed | Information not provided |\n| **CLPS: IM-4** | Uncrewed | Information not provided |\n| **CLPS: Draper** | Uncrewed | Information not provided |\n| **CLPS: Firefly M3**| Uncrewed | Information not provided |\n\n### Analysis of Crewed Mission Manifests\n\nThe research identified three upcoming crewed missions: Artemis II, NASA’s Boeing Starliner-1, and Artemis III. A focused investigation was conducted to ascertain the official crew assignments for these missions.\n\n#### Artemis II Crew Composition\n\nThe crew for the Artemis II mission, which will be the first crewed flight of the Orion spacecraft, has been officially announced. The four-person crew includes representation from both NASA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).\n\n| Crew Member | Nationality | Official Biography |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Reid Wiseman** | American | [NASA Astronaut Reid Wiseman](https://www.nasa.gov/people/reid-wiseman/) |\n| **Victor Glover** | American | [NASA Astronaut Victor J. Glover](https://www.nasa.gov/people/victor-j-glover/) |\n| **Christina H. Koch**| American | [NASA Astronaut Christina Hammock Koch](https://www.nasa.gov/people/christina-hammock-koch/) |\n| **Jeremy Hansen** | Canadian | [CSA Astronaut Jeremy Hansen](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/canadian/active/jeremy-hansen.asp) |\n\n#### Pending Crew Announcements\n\nFor the subsequent crewed missions identified in the launch manifest—**Artemis III** and **NASA’s Boeing Starliner-1**—the official crew announcements have not yet been made. This is standard procedure, as crew selections are often finalized and publicized closer to the scheduled launch dates.\n\n---\n\n## Survey Note\n\n### Literature Review & Theoretical Framework\n\nThis research operates within the theoretical framework of NASA's contemporary exploration strategy, which is defined by a hybrid model of publicly funded programs and commercial partnerships. The presence of missions under the **Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)** initiative and the **Commercial Crew Program** (e.g., Boeing Starliner-1) in the launch manifest exemplifies this paradigm shift. This model aims to foster a commercial space economy while allowing NASA to focus resources on deep-space exploration goals, such as the Artemis program. The findings reflect this dual approach, with a manifest populated by both traditional scientific probes (IMAP) and commercially operated vehicles (Blue Origin, Sierra Space).\n\n### Methodology & Data Analysis\n\nThe research employed a qualitative data collection methodology involving a systematic review of the official NASA website. The analytical process was executed in three distinct phases:\n1.  **Source Identification**: The primary data repository was identified as the `nasa.gov/events` webpage, establishing a single, authoritative source for the launch manifest.\n2.  **Systematic Data Extraction**: Each entry on the manifest was systematically reviewed to extract key data points, including the mission title and target launch date.\n3.  **Categorical Analysis and Targeted Search**: Missions were categorized as \"crewed\" or \"uncrewed.\" For all missions identified as \"crewed,\" a subsequent targeted search was performed across the NASA domain to locate official crew manifests and biographical data. The absence of information, such as for the unannounced crews of Artemis III and Starliner-1, was explicitly documented as a finding.\n\n### Critical Discussion\n\nThe findings confirm a high degree of transparency in NASA's long-term launch scheduling. The public availability of a detailed manifest allows for significant academic and public oversight. However, the research also highlights a clear distinction between the disclosure of operational plans (launch schedules) and personnel assignments (crew manifests). The phased release of crew information is a logical and expected protocol, likely driven by mission planning, training timelines, and operational security.\n\nA key limitation of this study is its reliance exclusively on publicly accessible, online information from NASA. The research does not incorporate data from internal documents, partner company websites, or other international space agencies, which could provide additional context. Furthermore, the launch schedule is dynamic; dates are \"no earlier than\" targets and are subject to change.\n\n### Future Research Directions\n\nFuture research should focus on the continuous monitoring of the official NASA Events schedule to track changes in launch dates and, most significantly, to capture the official crew announcements for Artemis III and Starliner-1 as they become public. A comparative analysis could be undertaken to contrast NASA's public disclosure practices with those of other national space agencies, such as the European Space Agency (ESA) and Roscosmos. Further investigation into the mission objectives and payload details for the various CLPS flights would also yield a more complete picture of the emerging lunar economy.",
