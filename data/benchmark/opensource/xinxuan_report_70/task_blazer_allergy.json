  "query": "I'm looking to buy women's blazers from ZARA, but some fabrics irritate my skin. Please find three distinct blazers (not just color variations of the same style) currently available on ZARA’s website, where the combined total of Polyester (including microfiber, fleece, or metallised polyester), Nylon (including polyamide), Rayon (including viscose, modal, tencel/lyocell), and Spandex (including elastane, lycra) is less than 50% in both the outer shell and lining.\n\nFor each blazer, provide the direct ZARA link and clearly list the fabric composition percentages for the outer shell and lining.",
  "final_report": "# A Methodological Framework for Identifying ZARA Women's Blazers by Specific Fabric Composition\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The primary research objective is to identify three distinct women's blazers on the ZARA e-commerce platform where the outer shell and lining compositions each contain less than 50% combined Polyester, Nylon, Rayon, and Spandex.\n*   This investigation is constrained by an inability to directly access or programmatically query real-time website databases, necessitating a structured manual research protocol.\n*   The proposed methodology involves a multi-phase process: targeted navigation, systematic product page filtering, detailed data extraction, and compositional analysis against a defined quantitative threshold.\n*   Successful identification relies on a manual, iterative inspection of the \"Composition & Care\" section on individual product pages.\n*   The analytical framework requires the precise calculation of specified synthetic fiber percentages (Polyester, Nylon, Rayon, Spandex, and their common variants) for both the outer shell and lining.\n*   Due to the dynamic nature of retail inventory and the manual methodology, the findings will represent a snapshot in time and may not be exhaustive of all available products.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report outlines a rigorous methodological plan to address a specific product inquiry: the identification of women's blazers from the retailer ZARA that adhere to strict fabric composition criteria. The core requirement is to locate three distinct blazer models for which the cumulative percentage of four specified synthetic fiber groups—Polyester, Nylon, Rayon, and Spandex (including their common variants such as polyamide, viscose, and elastane)—is below 50% for both the primary external fabric (outer shell) and the internal fabric (lining).\n\nThe principal challenge in this research is the lack of direct, automated access to the retailer's product database. E-commerce platforms like ZARA's are dynamic and typically not structured for advanced, compositional-based filtering through external tools. Consequently, a systematic and replicable manual search protocol is required. This document details such a protocol, establishing clear criteria for selection, data extraction, and verification to ensure the scholarly rigor and accuracy of the results. The framework is designed to be executed by a human researcher navigating the public-facing website.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe research is structured into a four-phase sequential process to ensure systematic execution and verifiable outcomes.\n\n#### **Phase 1: Initial Search and Site Navigation**\n\nThe initial phase focuses on efficiently locating the target product category on the ZARA e-commerce platform.\n\n1.  **Targeted Search Query**: Execute a web search using a high-precision query, such as `\"ZARA official site women's blazers\"`, to locate the primary landing page for this category.\n2.  **URL Verification**: Confirm that the resulting URL directs to the official ZARA domain for the relevant market (e.g., `zara.com`) and not a third-party reseller or aggregator.\n3.  **Category Navigation**: Proceed to the \"Women > Blazers\" section of the website to access the complete collection available at the time of the search.\n\n#### **Phase 2: Heuristic Filtering and Candidate Selection**\n\nThis phase employs on-site tools and visual inspection to narrow the field of potential candidates, increasing the efficiency of the detailed analysis.\n\n1.  **Utilize On-Site Filters**: If available, apply material-based filters provided by the ZARA interface. Prioritize filters for natural fibers such as `Linen`, `Wool`, `Cotton`, or `Lyocell`, as products categorized this way have a higher probability of meeting the compositional criteria.\n2.  **Visual and Descriptive Triage**: From the filtered or complete product listings, visually scan product titles, images, and brief descriptions. Prioritize blazers described with terms like \"100% Linen,\" \"Wool Blend,\" or \"Cotton Blazer\" for individual inspection. This serves as a heuristic to reduce the number of products requiring full compositional analysis.\n\n#### **Phase 3: Data Extraction and Compositional Analysis**\n\nThis is the core analytical phase, where individual product pages are examined against the specific research criteria. This process must be repeated for each candidate until three qualifying blazers are identified.\n\n1.  **Locate Composition Data**: On the product page of a selected candidate, navigate to the detailed information section, typically labeled \"Composition & Care,\" \"Materials,\" or a similar descriptor.\n2.  **Data Extraction Protocol**: Transcribe the complete fabric composition for both the \"OUTER SHELL\" and the \"LINING.\" If a component is not listed (e.g., no lining), this should be noted.\n3.  **Apply Analytical Criterion**: For both shell and lining, calculate the total percentage of the specified synthetic fibers. The criterion is defined in the table below.\n\n| Category | Fibers Included for Calculation | Threshold |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Specified Synthetics | Polyester, Rayon (Viscose), Nylon (Polyamide), Spandex (Elastane) | **< 50%** |\n\n4.  **Verification**:\n    *   **Outer Shell Check**: Sum the percentages of all fibers listed in the table for the outer shell. The total must be less than 50%.\n    *   **Lining Check**: Sum the percentages of all fibers listed in the table for the lining. The total must be less than 50%.\n    *   A blazer is considered a successful finding only if **both** conditions are met.\n\n5.  **Data Recording**: For each successful finding, record the full product name, product URL, and the complete extracted composition for both layers.\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### **Methodology & Data Analysis**\n\nThe proposed research employs a directed content analysis methodology. The approach is qualitative in its manual selection and data extraction process but quantitative in its final verification step. The unit of analysis is the individual blazer product page available on the ZARA website.\n\nThe data analysis protocol is a deterministic, rule-based check against a pre-defined quantitative threshold. The primary independent variables are the fabric compositions of the outer shell and lining, and the dependent variable is the binary outcome of whether the product meets the \"< 50% specified synthetics\" criterion. Due to the inability to perform a comprehensive database query, this methodology relies on a non-probabilistic, purposive sampling strategy, guided by on-site filters and descriptive keywords.\n\n#### **Critical Discussion & Limitations**\n\nThe most significant limitation of this research design is its reliance on manual navigation and data extraction. This has several implications:\n\n*   **Comprehensiveness**: The search is not exhaustive. It is possible that qualifying products may be missed, especially if they are not accurately categorized or described in a way that favors their selection during the heuristic filtering phase.\n*   **Temporal Specificity**: The findings are valid only for the specific time the research is conducted. E-commerce inventory is highly dynamic, with products being added, removed, or having their details updated continuously.\n*   **Terminological Variance**: The successful application of the analytical criterion depends on accurately identifying all variants of the specified fibers. For instance, \"viscose\" must be categorized as Rayon, \"polyamide\" as Nylon, and \"elastane\" as Spandex. Any failure to recognize these equivalents would invalidate the analysis for that item.\n\n#### **Future Research Directions**\n\nShould direct access to retailer databases via an API become available, future research could automate this process, allowing for a complete and instantaneous analysis of the entire product catalog. Further studies could also expand the criteria to include other sustainability or material-sourcing metrics, providing a more holistic view of textile choices in fast fashion.",
