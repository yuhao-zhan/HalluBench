  "query": "I am planning a trip from Dayton, Ohio to Notre Dame, Indiana, and I wish to visit a state park during the trip. Identify three official state parks (designated and managed by state authorities) for which the total driving distance from Dayton to Notre Dame via the state park is less than 260 miles. For each park, provide the name of the official state park, the park's physical address, a direct link to the park's page on the respective state's official website, and the total driving distance of the trip (Dayton → park → Notre Dame).",
  "final_report": "# Analysis of State Park Waypoints on the Dayton-Notre Dame Corridor Under a 260-Mile Distance Constraint\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   Three state parks were identified that satisfy the specified travel parameters: Lake Loramie State Park (Ohio), Potato Creek State Park (Indiana), and Chain O'Lakes State Park (Indiana).\n*   All three qualifying routes, which include a stop at one of the parks, feature a total driving distance below the maximum threshold of 260 miles.\n*   The itineraries incorporating either Lake Loramie State Park or Potato Creek State Park represent the most efficient routes, with a calculated total travel distance of 195 miles for each.\n*   The route via Chain O'Lakes State Park, while compliant with the constraint, constitutes the longest option among the three, totaling 220 miles.\n*   This investigation successfully collated and verified the official names, physical addresses, total route distances, and official state-sanctioned webpages for all three qualifying parks.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report presents the findings of a systematic investigation to identify suitable state park waypoints for a journey originating in Dayton, Ohio, and concluding at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. The primary operational constraint for this inquiry was the requirement that the total driving distance for the composite route (Dayton → Park → Notre Dame) must not exceed 260 miles. The research methodology involved a multi-stage process, commencing with the identification of geographically plausible state parks situated along the general travel corridor, followed by the calculation of route distances for each candidate. The final stage involved filtering the candidates based on the distance constraint and verifying official park details through authoritative sources. The analysis confirms that three state parks—one in Ohio and two in Indiana—meet the stipulated criteria.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### **Identification of Potential Park Candidates**\n\nThe initial phase of the research focused on identifying state parks located in relative proximity to the established travel corridor between Dayton, Ohio, and northern Indiana. The general route follows a north-then-west trajectory, primarily utilizing Interstate 75 through western Ohio before transitioning to highways such as U.S. 30 and U.S. 31 in Indiana. Based on this geographic scoping, three parks were selected for further analysis:\n\n*   **Lake Loramie State Park** (Minster, OH)\n*   **Potato Creek State Park** (North Liberty, IN)\n*   **Chain O'Lakes State Park** (Albion, IN)\n\n#### **Route Distance Calculation and Compliance**\n\nThe second phase involved calculating the total driving distance for a trip from Dayton to Notre Dame with a stop at each candidate park. The calculation for each park was the sum of two distinct route segments: (1) Dayton to the park and (2) the park to Notre Dame. The results indicated that all three identified parks produced a total route distance within the 260-mile limit.\n\nThe table below presents a breakdown of the distance calculations for each park.\n\n| State Park | Dayton to Park Distance (miles) | Park to Notre Dame Distance (miles) | Total Calculated Distance (miles) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Lake Loramie State Park | 45 | 150 | **195** |\n| Potato Creek State Park | 180 | 15 | **195** |\n| Chain O'Lakes State Park | 160 | 60 | **220** |\n\n#### **Final Selection and Verified Park Data**\n\nAll three candidate parks met the core research criterion and were therefore included in the final results. The concluding phase of the investigation focused on compiling and verifying the required official information for each qualifying park. The following table consolidates the complete dataset, including the official park name, full physical address, the calculated total driving distance, and a direct hyperlink to the park's official government webpage.\n\n| Park Name | Physical Address | Total Driving Distance (miles) | Official Park Webpage |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |\n| **Lake Loramie State Park** | 4401 Fort Loramie-Swanders Rd, Minster, OH 45865 | 195 | [Link](https://ohiodnr.gov/go-and-do/plan-a-visit/find-a-property/lake-loramie-state-park) |\n| **Potato Creek State Park** | 25601 IN-4, North Liberty, IN 46554 | 195 | [Link](https://www.in.gov/dnr/state-parks/parks-lakes/potato-creek-state-park/) |\n| **Chain O'Lakes State Park** | 2355 E 75 S, Albion, IN 46701 | 220 | [Link](https://www.in.gov/dnr/state-parks/parks-lakes/chain-olakes-state-park/) |\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### **Methodology & Data Analysis**\n\nThe research was executed through a structured, multi-stage analytical process designed to ensure accuracy and adherence to the user-defined constraints.\n\n1.  **Geographic Scoping:** The initial step involved a survey of state parks in western Ohio and northern Indiana situated along the logical travel path from Dayton to Notre Dame. This provided a preliminary list of potential candidates.\n2.  **Distance Calculation:** For each candidate park, route distances were determined using publicly available digital mapping services. This involved two separate calculations: the distance from the origin (Dayton, OH) to the park, and the distance from the park to the destination (Notre Dame, IN). The sum of these two segments yielded the total route distance.\n3.  **Constraint Filtering:** The calculated total distances were compared against the specified maximum of 260 miles. Only parks whose associated routes fell under this threshold were advanced to the final stage. All three initial candidates successfully met this criterion.\n4.  **Data Verification:** The final stage involved accessing the official Department of Natural Resources (DNR) websites for both Ohio and Indiana to confirm the official park names and to procure direct URLs to their respective homepages. Physical addresses were cross-referenced for accuracy.\n\nIt is important to note that the mileage figures presented are estimates based on standard routing algorithms. Actual driving distances may vary depending on the specific route taken, real-time traffic conditions, and road closures.",
