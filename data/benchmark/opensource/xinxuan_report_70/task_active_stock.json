  "final_report": "# Analysis of U.S. Companies with High Trading Volume and Sub-$15 Billion Market Capitalization\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   A cohort of ten U.S. exchange-listed companies has been identified based on the general criteria of high trading volume and a market capitalization below $15 billion.\n*   The Central Index Key (CIK) codes for all ten selected companies were successfully retrieved from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) EDGAR database.\n*   Initial research encountered methodological constraints, specifically the inability to utilize a direct stock screening tool, necessitating an alternative identification strategy.\n*   The specific quantitative data for average trading volume and current market capitalization for each company, along with verification URLs, were not available in the provided research materials.\n*   The identified companies represent a diverse range of sectors, including social media, entertainment, automotive, and energy technologies.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report presents the findings of a research exercise to identify ten U.S. exchange-listed companies that meet two specific quantitative criteria: an average daily trading volume exceeding 10 million shares and a market capitalization of no more than $15 billion. These parameters are often used to isolate actively traded, liquid securities in the small- to mid-cap range, which may be of interest for further financial analysis or investment screening.\n\nThe research process involved an initial identification of potential companies followed by the retrieval of their unique Central Index Key (CIK) codes from the SEC's EDGAR database. This report outlines the methodological approach, presents the list of identified companies and their CIK codes, and discusses the limitations inherent in the provided data.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThis section details the research methodology, presents the findings, and discusses the constraints of the data-gathering process.\n\n#### Methodological Approach and Limitations\n\nThe initial research plan involved utilizing a stock screening tool to systematically filter for companies that precisely match the specified volume and market capitalization criteria. However, the provided research logs indicate that access to a functional, direct-access screener proved unsuccessful. This constraint required a pivot in methodology toward identifying candidate companies through alternative sources, followed by data verification.\n\nThe subsequent step successfully identified ten companies and retrieved their CIK codes from the SEC EDGAR database, a critical step for accessing regulatory filings. However, a significant limitation must be noted: the research documentation does not contain the concluding data points from the verification stage. Specifically, the precise average trading volume and current market capitalization figures for each company, along with the corresponding source URLs for verification, were not included. Therefore, while the following list represents the identified cohort, their definitive compliance with the quantitative criteria at the time of reporting is not corroborated by the provided materials.\n\n#### Identified Companies and Regulatory Data\n\nThe primary output of the research exercise was the successful compilation of ten companies and their associated regulatory identifiers. The CIK code is a unique number assigned by the SEC to individuals and corporations for tracking all filings. The table below lists the identified companies, their stock ticker symbols, and their confirmed CIK codes.\n\n| Company Name | Ticker Symbol | CIK Code |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Reddit Inc. | RDDT | 1713445 |\n| Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. | DJT | 1849635 |\n| Paramount Global | PARA | 813828 |\n| AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. | AMC | 1411579 |\n| GameStop Corp. | GME | 1326380 |\n| SoFi Technologies, Inc. | SOFI | 1818874 |\n| Rivian Automotive, Inc. | RIVN | 1874178 |\n| Lucid Group, Inc. | LCID | 1811210 |\n| ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. | CHPT | 1777392 |\n| Plug Power Inc. | PLUG | 1093691 |\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### Methodology & Data Analysis\n\nThe research methodology was executed in two distinct phases: (1) identification of candidate equities and (2) retrieval of regulatory CIK codes. The first phase encountered difficulties, preventing a systematic, data-driven screening. The second phase was successfully executed, utilizing the SEC's public EDGAR database to confirm the CIK for each identified entity. The provided links in the citation section lead to these EDGAR filings, which serve as the primary source for the CIK codes presented.\n\n#### Critical Discussion\n\nThe primary contribution of this research exercise is the confirmed list of CIK codes for a cohort of companies generally fitting the description of high-volume, sub-$15B market capitalization stocks. The retrieval of CIK codes is a foundational step for any in-depth due diligence, as it enables direct access to all corporate filings, including annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) reports.\n\nHowever, the principal limitation is the absence of the verified quantitative data that formed the basis for the selection. Without the specific average volume and market capitalization figures, a rigorous confirmation of the list's adherence to the initial query is not possible. The analysis is therefore preliminary and rests on the unverified assumption that these companies met the criteria at the time of their selection. Any further analysis would require an independent verification of these metrics from a reliable financial data provider.",
