The maximum number of patients a single caregiver can legally serve\n2. The minimum age requirement to become a caregiver\n3. Whether the caregiver must be a resident of the state\n4. Whether caregivers are allowed to grow marijuana plants on behalf of patients\n5. If growing is allowed, the maximum number of plants per patient",
  "final_report": "# A Methodological Assessment of Research into U.S. Medical Marijuana Caregiver Regulations\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The primary objective was to conduct a comparative analysis of medical marijuana caregiver laws across ten U.S. states, focusing on five specific regulatory parameters.\n*   The research was structured to systematically gather data for three regional groupings: West Coast/Mountain, Southwest/Midwest, and Northeast states.\n*   Systematic research attempts for all ten targeted states (CA, CO, OR, WA, AZ, MI, IL, MA, NY, PA) failed to yield the specific required data.\n*   The available research tools consistently returned general, tangential, or non-pertinent information, precluding any detailed legal analysis.\n*   The fundamental limitation identified was the inability of the data acquisition tools to access and parse specific state-level legal statutes and regulatory codes.\n*   Consequently, this report cannot provide the intended comparative legal analysis due to a complete absence of the necessary primary data.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThe legal frameworks governing medical marijuana programs in the United States exhibit significant state-by-state variability, particularly concerning the roles and limitations of designated caregivers. Caregivers are integral to patient access, especially for minors, the severely ill, and individuals unable to procure or cultivate cannabis independently. This report was intended to provide a rigorous, comparative analysis of caregiver regulations in ten states: California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Michigan, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania. The research protocol was designed to systematically collect data on five key metrics: maximum patient allowances, minimum caregiver age, residency stipulations, cultivation rights, and plant limits.\n\nHowever, the execution of this research plan was met with insurmountable methodological obstacles. The data acquisition process, conducted in three distinct phases, failed to retrieve the specific, granular regulatory details required for the analysis. This document, therefore, serves not as a comparative legal study, but as a report on the research process itself, detailing the methodological limitations that prevented the fulfillment of the primary objective.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe research was methodologically structured to investigate distinct regional cohorts of states. This section details the objective and outcome of each research phase. Due to the uniform failure to acquire data, the presentation of comparative tables is not possible.\n\n#### **Phase 1: West Coast & Mountain States (CA, CO, OR, WA)**\n\nThe initial phase of research targeted California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, states with long-standing cannabis programs. The objective was to source specific regulations pertaining to caregiver-patient ratios, age requirements, residency, and cultivation. The search queries were designed to locate official state government or regulatory body documentation. The result of this inquiry was a failure to procure any of the specified data points. The search tools provided links to general informational sites, such as Wikipedia and scholarship search engines, which lack the requisite legal and regulatory specificity.\n\n#### **Phase 2: Southwest & Midwest States (AZ, MI, IL)**\n\nThe second phase focused on Arizona, Michigan, and Illinois. The research protocol remained consistent, aiming to identify and extract the five key regulatory data points for caregivers in each state. This attempt mirrored the outcome of the first phase. The search results were uniformly irrelevant to the research question, providing links to tourism websites, financial aid services, and general scholarship directories. No specific legal or regulatory information regarding medical marijuana caregivers was retrieved.\n\n#### **Phase 3: Northeast States (MA, NY, PA)**\n\nThe final phase of data collection targeted Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania. Despite repeated attempts to query for specific caregiver laws, this effort also proved unsuccessful. The research tools were unable to locate any documents or sources detailing the maximum number of patients, age requirements, residency rules, or cultivation limits for medical marijuana caregivers in these jurisdictions.\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### **Literature Review & Theoretical Framework**\n\nA comprehensive analysis of this topic would necessitate a review of primary legal sources, including state statutes, administrative codes, and regulations issued by state health departments or cannabis control commissions. The theoretical framework for such a study rests on principles of federalism and regulatory divergence, examining how different state governments balance patient access, public safety, and controlled substance management. The research plan was predicated on the ability to access these primary source materials, which proved infeasible with the available tools.\n\n#### **Methodology & Data Analysis**\n\nThe intended methodology was a qualitative comparative analysis. The plan involved:\n1.  Systematic data collection for 10 states across 5 pre-defined variables.\n2.  Compilation of the data into a comparative matrix for cross-state analysis.\n3.  Analysis of patterns, divergences, and potential policy implications of the varying regulatory approaches.\n\nThis methodology failed at the first step. The inability of the employed research tools to retrieve specific numerical and statutory data from official sources represents a critical methodological failure. The retrieved information was consistently of a general nature and did not align with the granular requirements of the research design.\n\n#### **Critical Discussion**\n\nThe principal limitation of this research endeavor is the data acquisition mechanism. The information sought is publicly available through state legislative and regulatory agency websites. However, the search tools used in the research process were incapable of navigating these complex governmental sources to extract the specific data points required. The failure is not an indication that the information does not exist, but rather that the tools were inadequate for this specialized legal research task. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn about the comparative legal landscape of medical marijuana caregiver laws. The only valid conclusion is that the research methodology was fundamentally constrained by its tools.\n\n#### **Future Research Directions**\n\nFor this research to be successfully executed, future efforts must employ more specialized research tools. Recommendations include:\n*   Direct access to and manual searching of state legislature and public health department websites.\n*   Utilization of specialized legal research databases such as Westlaw, LexisNexis, or other platforms designed to aggregate and search statutory and regulatory law.\n*   Analysis of reports and publications from cannabis policy research organizations that often compile and compare state-level laws.\n\nA revised methodology employing these targeted approaches would be required to produce the intended comparative analysis.",
