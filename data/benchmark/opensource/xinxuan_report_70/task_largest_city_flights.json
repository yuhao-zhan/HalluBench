  "final_report": "# A Methodological Framework for Planning a Multi-City Flight Itinerary Between the Three Largest U.S. Metropolitan Areas\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   **Destination Identification:** The three largest cities in the United States by population, identified as the itinerary destinations, are New York (New York), Los Angeles (California), and Chicago (Illinois), based on 2020 census data.\n*   **Itinerary Structure:** A three-leg flight plan is proposed, commencing on October 13, 2025, with sequential three-night stays in the second and third cities, culminating in a return to the origin city.\n*   **Search Parameters:** The research specifies non-stop, economy class flights with afternoon arrivals (defined as 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM local time) for each leg of the journey.\n*   **Data Acquisition Gap:** Initial reconnaissance efforts were unable to procure specific flight details (e.g., flight numbers, schedules, pricing) from the available sources, necessitating a structured research plan.\n*   **Proposed Methodology:** This report outlines a systematic plan to acquire the required flight data by querying airline-direct websites and major flight aggregation platforms using precisely defined parameters.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report delineates a research plan to construct a multi-city flight itinerary connecting the three most populous cities in the United States: New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. The objective is to identify specific flight options that conform to a predefined set of criteria, including travel dates, flight class, and arrival times. The initial phase of the research successfully identified the target cities based on authoritative demographic data. However, a significant data gap was encountered, as specific flight information was not retrievable through preliminary searches. Consequently, this document transitions from a report of findings to a methodological proposal. It presents a structured framework for the systematic acquisition and analysis of the requisite flight data, thereby establishing a clear pathway to fulfill the original research objective.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### **1. Itinerary Definition and Logistics**\n\nThe foundation of the flight plan is based on empirical data identifying the largest urban centers and a logical travel schedule.\n\n**1.1. Destination Confirmation**\nThe selection of cities for the itinerary is based on the most recent comprehensive demographic data available from the 2020 U.S. Census. The top three municipalities by population are:\n1.  New York, New York\n2.  Los Angeles, California\n3.  Chicago, Illinois\n\nThese three metropolitan areas will serve as the nodes for the multi-city travel plan.\n\n**1.2. Itinerary Schedule and Routing**\nA logical geographic progression is proposed to structure the itinerary, originating in New York and proceeding westward. The travel dates are fixed according to the research parameters, incorporating three-night stays in Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\n| Leg | Route | Departure Date | Stay Duration |\n| :-- | :---- | :------------- | :------------ |\n| 1   | New York (NYC) -> Chicago (CHI) | October 13, 2025 | 3 Nights      |\n| 2   | Chicago (CHI) -> Los Angeles (LAX) | October 16, 2025 | 3 Nights      |\n| 3   | Los Angeles (LAX) -> New York (NYC) | October 19, 2025 | N/A           |\n\n#### **2. Proposed Research Methodology for Data Acquisition**\n\nGiven the inability to procure flight data through initial searches, a formal data collection strategy is required. This methodology is designed to systematically query relevant sources to obtain the necessary information.\n\n**2.1. Data Source Selection**\nThe research will utilize a dual-source approach to ensure comprehensive coverage and data validation:\n*   **Primary Sources (Airline Websites):** Direct queries to major U.S. carriers that service the specified routes (e.g., American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, JetBlue). This approach yields the most accurate pricing and availability data.\n*   **Secondary Sources (Flight Aggregators):** Utilization of established flight comparison platforms (e.g., Google Flights, Kayak, Skyscanner). These tools are efficient for broad market comparison and identifying a wide range of carrier options simultaneously.\n\n**2.2. Search Parameter Specification**\nTo ensure consistency and comparability of results, all queries will adhere to the strict parameters outlined below. This table operationalizes the research requirements for execution on booking platforms.\n\n| Parameter | Leg 1: NYC → CHI | Leg 2: CHI → LAX | Leg 3: LAX → NYC |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Departure Date** | 2025-10-13 | 2025-10-16 | 2025-10-19 |\n| **Travel Class** | Economy | Economy | Economy |\n| **Flight Type** | Non-stop | Non-stop | Non-stop |\n| **Arrival Window** | 12:00 – 17:00 | 12:00 – 17:00 | 12:00 – 17:00 |\n| **Departure Airports** | JFK, LGA, EWR | ORD, MDW | LAX, BUR, LGB |\n| **Arrival Airports** | ORD, MDW | LAX, BUR, LGB | JFK, LGA, EWR |\n\n**2.3. Data Collation and Analysis**\nData retrieved from the queries will be compiled into a structured dataset. The following fields will be collected for each qualifying flight option:\n*   Airline\n*   Flight Number\n*   Departure Airport\n*   Departure Time\n*   Arrival Airport\n*   Arrival Time\n*   Flight Duration\n*   Price (USD)\n\nOnce compiled, the data will be analyzed to identify the optimal flight for each leg of the journey, balancing factors such as cost, schedule convenience, and airport choice.\n\n#### **3. Acknowledged Limitations**\n\nThe primary limitation of this study is the current absence of empirical flight data. The information presented herein is a research *plan* rather than a presentation of results. It must be noted that flight pricing and availability are highly dynamic. Data collected on a specific date reflects a snapshot in time and is subject to change without notice. The execution of the proposed methodology will provide a concrete itinerary, but its cost is not guaranteed until booking is complete.\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n*   **Literature Review & Theoretical Framework**: The proposed research operates within the domain of applied logistics and consumer behavior in the commercial aviation market. The methodology implicitly acknowledges established principles of dynamic pricing, a cornerstone of revenue management theory in the airline industry. This theory posits that prices for perishable goods (like airline seats) are adjusted in real-time based on demand, time until consumption, and competitor pricing. Furthermore, the consideration of multi-airport systems (e.g., JFK/LGA/EWR for New York) aligns with transportation network analysis, which examines the efficiency and interconnectivity of travel hubs within a metropolitan region.\n\n*   **Methodology & Data Analysis**: The research design employs a structured query methodology for data collection from publicly accessible commercial databases (airline and aggregator websites). This approach is a form of observational study, recording existing market offerings without manipulation. The analysis will be primarily descriptive, aiming to identify and present flight options that meet the specified criteria. A comparative analysis will be used to select the most suitable option for each leg based on the collected data points (e.g., price, timing).\n\n*   **Critical Discussion**: A critical challenge in this research is the volatility of the primary data point: price. The findings will have a limited temporal validity. Furthermore, the definition of \"afternoon arrival\" (12:00 PM - 5:00 PM) is an operational constraint that may exclude potentially cost-effective options falling just outside this window. The exclusion of ancillary fees (e.g., for baggage or seat selection) in this initial planning stage is a scope limitation; a comprehensive cost analysis would require their inclusion.\n\n*   **Future Research Directions**: Subsequent research could expand upon this framework to incorporate additional variables for a more robust analysis. Such variables could include:\n    1.  **On-time performance metrics** for the shortlisted airlines and routes.\n    2.  A **total cost of travel analysis**, incorporating ancillary fees and ground transportation costs from various airports.\n    3.  A **qualitative analysis** of passenger experience based on airline, aircraft type, and cabin amenities.\n    4.  Exploration of **alternative itineraries**, such as open-jaw or different routing permutations, to assess cost-saving opportunities.",
