  "final_report": "# An Astronomical Inventory: An Analysis of Real-World Celestial Bodies in *Rick & Morty* (Seasons 1-7)\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   **Foundational Setting:** Earth, its Moon, and the Sun are foundational elements of the series' setting, established visually and narratively from the first episode, S01E01 \"Pilot\".\n*   **Limited Planetary Representation:** Of the Solar System's planets, only Mars and Venus have been explicitly referenced or depicted. Mars was first mentioned in Season 5 and visually shown in Season 6, while Venus was first mentioned in Season 6.\n*   **Absence of Major Planets:** A significant finding is the complete absence of any mention or depiction of Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune within the first seven seasons.\n*   **Dwarf Planet Prominence:** The dwarf planet Pluto receives a significant, plot-central focus in the Season 1 episode \"Something Ricked This Way Comes,\" far more than any Solar System planet.\n*   **Unnamed Galaxies:** Despite extensive intergalactic travel forming a core premise of the series, no explicit references are made to specific real-world galaxies, such as the Milky Way or Andromeda.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThe animated series *Rick & Morty* is renowned for its expansive science-fiction universe, characterized by interdimensional and intergalactic travel. While the narrative frequently explores fictitious worlds and alien civilizations, it remains anchored to a prime reality centered on Earth. This report provides a comprehensive and systematic analysis of all identifiable real-world celestial bodies that are explicitly mentioned or visually depicted within the first seven seasons of the series. The objective is to catalogue these appearances, providing a scholarly record of how our known cosmos is integrated into the show's complex narrative tapestry. The analysis reveals a selective and often thematically driven use of real astronomical objects, prioritizing narrative function over comprehensive cosmological representation.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe integration of real-world celestial bodies into the narrative of *Rick & Morty* is inconsistent, with some objects serving as foundational backdrops and others as central plot devices. The following sections categorize and detail the first appearance of each identified body based on an exhaustive review of seasons one through seven.\n\n#### Earth and its Satellite System\n\nEarth, the Moon, and the Sun are established as the primary setting from the series' inception. Their presence is fundamental to the show's core structure, grounding the fantastical adventures of the protagonists in a familiar, suburban context.\n\n*   **First Appearance:** Season 1, Episode 1 (\"Pilot\")\n*   **Significance:** Earth is the Smith family's home and the central hub from which nearly all adventures begin and end. The Sun and Moon are implicitly and visually present as parts of the terrestrial environment from the first scenes, providing daylight and appearing in sky backgrounds.\n\n#### Solar System Planets\n\nThe representation of other planets within Earth's solar system is remarkably sparse. Only two planets have been identified, with both appearances occurring in later seasons. The remaining five planets are conspicuously absent from the narrative.\n\n*   **Mars:** The planet Mars is first mentioned in S05E04 (\"Rickdependence Spray\") as a potential destination for a \"Giant Incest Baby.\" Its first visual depiction occurs later in S06E06 (\"Juricksic Mort\"), where it is shown as the location where technologically advanced dinosaurs have resettled.\n*   **Venus:** The first reference to Venus is in S06E03 (\"Bethic Twinstinct\"), where Space Beth presents a bottle of \"Venusian Wine.\" The planet is later personified through the character of the \"Viscount of Venus\" in S06E09 (\"A Rick in King Mortur's Mort\").\n\n#### Other Celestial Bodies\n\nBeyond the planets, the series features one dwarf planet prominently and notably omits references to larger astronomical structures like galaxies.\n\n*   **Pluto:** The dwarf planet Pluto is the subject of a major storyline in S01E09 (\"Something Ricked This Way Comes\"). The plot satirizes the debate over its planetary status, with Jerry and Morty traveling to the dwarf planet and discovering its inhabitants are exploiting its classification debate to conceal a corporate mining operation.\n*   **Galaxies:** Throughout seven seasons of extensive interstellar travel, there are no explicit mentions of the Milky Way, Andromeda, or any other specific, real-world galaxy. The adventures are situated in countless unnamed galaxies and dimensions.\n\n#### Summary of Findings\n\nThe table below provides a consolidated summary of all identified real-world celestial bodies and their inaugural appearance in *Rick & Morty*.\n\n| Celestial Body | First Appearance/Mention | Episode (SXXEXX) | Episode Title | Notes |\n|----------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Earth | Appearance | S01E01 | \"Pilot\" | The primary setting for the series. |\n| The Moon | Appearance | S01E01 | \"Pilot\" | Appears as Earth's natural satellite. |\n| The Sun | Appearance | S01E01 | \"Pilot\" | The star of the solar system, providing daylight. |\n| Pluto | Appearance | S01E09 | \"Something Ricked This Way Comes\" | Central to the episode's A-plot. |\n| Mars | Mention | S05E04 | \"Rickdependence Spray\" | First visual appearance in S06E06, \"Juricksic Mort.\" |\n| Venus | Mention | S06E03 | \"Bethic Twinstinct\" | Personified as a character in S06E09. |\n| Mercury | Not Referenced | N/A | N/A | No mention or depiction found in S1-S7. |\n| Jupiter | Not Referenced | N/A | N/A | No mention or depiction found in S1-S7. |\n| Saturn | Not Referenced | N/A | N/A | No mention or depiction found in S1-S7. |\n| Uranus | Not Referenced | N/A | N/A | No mention or depiction found in S1-S7. |\n| Neptune | Not Referenced | N/A | N/A | No mention or depiction found in S1-S7. |\n| Milky Way Galaxy| Not Referenced | N/A | N/A | No specific, real-world galaxies are named. |\n| Andromeda Galaxy| Not Referenced | N/A | N/A | No specific, real-world galaxies are named. |",
