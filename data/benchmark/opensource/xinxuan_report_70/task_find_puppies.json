  "final_report": "# An Analytical Report on the Identification of Available Canines via the American Kennel Club Marketplace\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   Initial research successfully identified twelve distinct long-haired dog breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) with a standard weight not exceeding 65 pounds.\n*   A systematic attempt to query the AKC Marketplace for available puppies meeting specific criteria (female, located in Ohio) was methodologically unsuccessful.\n*   Technical impediments, specifically the failure of data acquisition tools to access and parse the target website (`marketplace.akc.org`), prevented the collection of live listing data.\n*   As a direct consequence of these technical limitations, the primary research objective—to identify and provide details for five specific puppies—could not be fulfilled.\n*   The research provides a vetted list of qualifying breeds, which serves as a foundational dataset for subsequent manual investigation by the end-user.\n*   The findings underscore the critical dependence of automated web-based research on the accessibility and structure of target data sources.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis report delineates the methodology and outcomes of a research initiative aimed at identifying specific canine puppies available for sale. The objective was to locate five long-haired, female puppies, each from a different breed with a standard adult weight under 65 pounds, listed for sale within the state of Ohio on the American Kennel Club (AKC) Marketplace. The investigation was structured as a multi-phase process, commencing with the identification of suitable breeds based on official AKC standards, followed by a targeted query of the live marketplace database.\n\nWhile the preliminary phase of breed identification was successfully executed, the subsequent data acquisition phase encountered insurmountable technical obstacles. This report presents a transparent account of the research process, detailing both the successful identification of qualifying breeds and the methodological failure to retrieve specific listing data from the AKC Marketplace. The analysis highlights the limitations inherent in automated data extraction from dynamic web platforms and provides the foundational data necessary for manual execution of the search.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### **Phase I: Identification of Qualifying Breeds**\n\nThe initial phase of the research focused on establishing a cohort of dog breeds that conform to the user-specified criteria of having long hair and a standard weight of 65 pounds or less. This process involved a systematic review of breed standards as published by the American Kennel Club. The research successfully identified twelve distinct breeds meeting these parameters. The findings from this phase are summarized in the table below, providing a foundational list for the subsequent, though unsuccessful, search phase.\n\n| Breed | Standard Weight (pounds) | Key Characteristics |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Afghan Hound** | 50–60 lbs | Thick, silky coat; elegant and dignified presence. |\n| **Bearded Collie** | 45–55 lbs | Long, shaggy coat; energetic herding dog. |\n| **Havanese** | 7–13 lbs | Long, soft, wavy coat; sturdy toy breed. |\n| **Lhasa Apso** | 12–18 lbs | Long, dense, straight coat; assertive disposition. |\n| **Pekingese** | Up to 14 lbs | Long, profuse coat; confident toy breed. |\n| **Pomeranian** | 3–7 lbs | Long, abundant double coat; lively and playful. |\n| **Puli** | 25–35 lbs | Naturally corded coat; intelligent and loyal. |\n| **Shih Tzu** | 9–16 lbs | Long, flowing double coat; charming and affectionate. |\n| **Silky Terrier** | Approx. 10 lbs | Long, fine, glossy coat; toy terrier class. |\n| **Skye Terrier** | 25–40 lbs | Long, straight coat; courageous and devoted. |\n| **Tibetan Terrier** | 20–24 lbs | Long, thick double coat; intelligent and good-natured. |\n| **Yorkshire Terrier** | Approx. 7 lbs | Long, fine, silky coat; feisty and affectionate. |\n\n#### **Phase II: Methodological Impasse in Marketplace Data Acquisition**\n\nThe second phase of the investigation required a targeted search of the AKC Marketplace (`marketplace.akc.org`). The objective was to filter listings based on the previously identified breeds and the additional criteria of 'Female' sex and 'Ohio' location. However, this phase was terminated due to a persistent methodological failure.\n\nThe provided research notes indicate that attempts to utilize automated search and web-crawling tools to access the AKC Marketplace were unsuccessful. The tools reportedly returned irrelevant results, pointing to unrelated domains, and failed to directly access or parse the content of the target website. This technical failure created an insurmountable barrier to data collection. No listings for puppies could be accessed, reviewed, or cataloged. Consequently, it is not possible to confirm the availability of any puppies matching the specified criteria. The inability to interface with the live marketplace rendered the fulfillment of the primary research goal impossible.\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### **Methodology & Data Analysis**\n\nThe intended research methodology was a two-stage sequential process. The first stage, a literature and database review of the AKC breed registry, was executed without issue, yielding a discrete list of twelve qualifying breeds. The second stage was designed as an empirical data collection exercise, targeting the live database of the AKC Marketplace. The failure of this stage is a critical finding in itself. The data analysis portion of the project could not proceed due to a complete absence of collected data from the marketplace. This outcome highlights a significant limitation of the employed research tools, which appear incapable of navigating or scraping the specific architecture of the target website.\n\n#### **Critical Discussion**\n\nThe principal limitation of this study is its reliance on automated tools for accessing a dynamic, commercial web platform. The failure to retrieve data suggests that the AKC Marketplace may employ mechanisms that prevent automated scraping or that the tools themselves lacked the sophistication to handle the site's structure. This situation is not uncommon in web-based research, where data accessibility is often constrained by technical and proprietary barriers. The research findings are therefore incomplete, not due to a flaw in the conceptual framework, but due to a failure at the point of data acquisition. The conclusion drawn is that for certain proprietary web databases, manual human-driven searches may remain the only viable method for data extraction.\n\n#### **Future Research Directions**\n\nGiven the technical impasse, further investigation would necessitate an alternative data collection strategy. The most direct path forward, as suggested in the source documentation, is for the end-user to conduct a manual search on the AKC Marketplace website. This approach bypasses the limitations of the automated tools and allows for direct interaction with the site's search and filtering functionalities. The list of twelve qualifying breeds generated in Phase I of this report provides a validated starting point for such a manual search, ensuring that the user can efficiently query the marketplace for the desired breed characteristics. Future academic or automated inquiries targeting similar platforms should first perform a technical feasibility analysis to ascertain the compatibility of collection tools with the target website's architecture.",
