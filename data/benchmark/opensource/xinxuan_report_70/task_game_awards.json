  "final_report": "# Research Plan: Analysis of Recent Award-Winning Video Games\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The initial research attempt failed to retrieve the necessary data on award-winning games due to limitations in the search tool's ability to parse relevant results.\n*   This plan proposes a multi-phased, systematic research methodology prioritizing official and high-authority secondary sources for data acquisition.\n*   The research is structured sequentially, beginning with the collection of full winner lists for each award ceremony, followed by the specific identification of 'Game of the Year' recipients.\n*   A targeted search protocol will be employed for each 'Game of the Year' winner to locate its official webpage and a representative critical review on YouTube.\n*   Data verification through source triangulation is a critical component of the methodology to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected information.\n*   The proposed strategy is designed to overcome the previously encountered search failures by employing more precise queries directed at known authoritative domains.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThe objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the most critically acclaimed video games from the past year, as recognized by three prominent industry events: The Game Awards (TGA), the Golden Joystick Awards, and the Steam Awards. The inquiry requires the compilation of complete winner lists from each event, the specific identification of the \"Game of the Year\" (or equivalent top-honoree) for each, and the subsequent collection of primary (official website) and secondary (YouTube review) assets for these top-tier games.\n\nInitial attempts to gather this information proved unsuccessful, as the employed search tools failed to yield relevant data. This document outlines a formal research plan to rectify this data acquisition failure. It presents a structured, methodological approach to systematically collect and verify the required information, ensuring a high degree of accuracy and completeness for the final report.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe research will be executed in a phased approach to ensure a logical and efficient workflow. The primary obstacle to overcome is the non-specific output from broad search queries. Therefore, this methodology emphasizes targeted searches on high-authority domains.\n\n#### Research Phases and Methodological Protocol\n\nThe research process is segmented into four distinct phases, from broad data collection to specific asset retrieval.\n\n| Phase | Action | Target Sources & Keywords | Verification Protocol |\n|-------|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **1. Primary Data Acquisition** | Collect complete winner lists for each award event. | **Primary:** Official websites (e.g., `thegameawards.com`, `store.steampowered.com/steamawards`).<br>**Secondary:** Major gaming news outlets (e.g., IGN, GameSpot, Polygon).<br>**Keywords:** `\"[Award Name] [Year] winners list\"` | Cross-reference the winner list between the official source and at least one reputable secondary source to confirm accuracy. |\n| **2. 'Game of the Year' Identification** | From the verified lists, identify the title awarded 'Game of the Year' (or its equivalent, such as 'Ultimate Game of the Year' for the Golden Joysticks). | The verified winner lists from Phase 1. | Note the exact category title and the winning game. No external verification is needed if Phase 1 is completed correctly. |\n| **3. Official Asset Retrieval** | Locate the official website for each 'Game of the Year' winner. | Game publisher/developer websites.<br>**Keywords:** `\"[Game Title] official website\"` | Verify that the discovered site is the primary portal managed by the publisher or developer, not a fan site or wiki. Check for official branding and copyright notices. |\n| **4. Critical Reception Analysis** | Find a representative, high-quality review video on YouTube for each 'Game of the Year' winner. | YouTube.<br>**Keywords:** `\"[Game Title] review\"` | Select a review from a major, reputable publication (e.g., IGN, GameSpot, Skill Up, Digital Foundry) to ensure a professional and critical standard. Note the publication and reviewer. |\n\n#### Execution Strategy by Award Event\n\n1.  **The Game Awards (TGA):**\n    *   **Action:** Execute search queries for `\"The Game Awards 2024 winners\"`.\n    *   **Primary Target:** Navigate directly to `thegameawards.com`.\n    *   **Secondary Target:** If the official site is difficult to parse, consult articles from IGN or Polygon summarizing the results.\n    *   **Deliverable:** A complete list of TGA 2024 winners and the identified 'Game of the Year'.\n\n2.  **Golden Joystick Awards:**\n    *   **Action:** Execute search queries for `\"Golden Joystick Awards 2024 winners\"`.\n    *   **Primary Target:** Navigate to GamesRadar+, the host and official publisher of the award results.\n    *   **Secondary Target:** Reputable gaming journalism outlets that covered the event.\n    *   **Deliverable:** A complete list of Golden Joystick Awards 2024 winners and the identified 'Ultimate Game of the Year'.\n\n3.  **The Steam Awards:**\n    *   **Action:** Execute search queries for `\"Steam Awards 2024 winners\"`.\n    *   **Primary Target:** Navigate to the official Steam storefront, specifically the Steam Awards results page (`store.steampowered.com/steamawards`).\n    *   **Secondary Target:** PC gaming-focused publications like PC Gamer.\n    *   **Deliverable:** A complete list of Steam Awards 2024 winners and the identified 'Game of the Year'.\n\nUpon completion of these steps for all three events, the research will proceed to Phases 3 and 4 for each of the three identified 'Game of the Year' titles.\n\n---\n\n### Survey Note\n\n#### Literature Review & Theoretical Framework\n\nThis research plan is predicated on a source-verification framework common in digital humanities and media studies. The framework posits a hierarchy of source reliability for contemporary event-based research.\n\n*   **Tier 1 (Primary Sources):** Official organizing bodies (e.g., The Game Awards, Valve for Steam). These sources hold the highest authority and are considered the canonical record.\n*   **Tier 2 (High-Authority Secondary Sources):** Established, reputable journalistic entities with a history of editorial oversight (e.g., IGN, GameSpot, GamesRadar+, Polygon). These serve as the primary means of verification and often provide more accessible data presentation.\n*   **Tier 3 (Aggregators and Tertiary Sources):** Wikis, fan sites, and content aggregators. These sources are to be avoided for primary data collection due to potential inaccuracies and lack of editorial control but can sometimes be useful for preliminary search term discovery.\n\nThis plan exclusively targets Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources to ensure the integrity of the collected data.\n\n#### Methodology & Data Analysis\n\nThe core methodology is a **targeted, multi-phase qualitative data collection protocol**. The failure of the initial, broader search queries indicates a signal-to-noise ratio problem, which this methodology is designed to circumvent.\n\n1.  **Problem Definition:** Non-specific search queries are inefficient for retrieving precise, list-based data from event-specific domains.\n2.  **Proposed Solution:** A structured search strategy using refined keywords aimed at pre-identified, high-authority domains.\n3.  **Data Collection:** The process involves systematically populating a data table with the required information (Award Event, Category, Winner, Official Website, Review URL).\n4.  **Data Verification:** The principle of **triangulation** will be applied by comparing the data from the primary source (Tier 1) against a secondary journalistic source (Tier 2) to resolve any ambiguities and confirm accuracy.\n\n#### Critical Discussion\n\nA significant limitation of the initial research attempt was an over-reliance on the search tool's algorithmic interpretation of a broad query. This approach is susceptible to retrieving tangentially related content, promotional materials, or outdated information, rather than the specific, structured data required. The proposed plan mitigates this limitation by manually directing the search effort towards domains known to house the canonical information.\n\nPotential challenges in executing this plan include:\n*   Official websites may present data in a format not conducive to easy extraction (e.g., embedded within videos or complex interactive graphics).\n*   The term \"Game of the Year\" can have slight variations (e.g., \"Ultimate Game of the Year\"), requiring careful attention to award category nomenclature.\n*   Selecting a single \"representative\" YouTube review is inherently subjective; the criterion of using major publications is a heuristic to ensure a baseline level of critical and professional quality.",
