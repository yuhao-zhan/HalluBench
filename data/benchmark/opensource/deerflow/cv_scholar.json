Previous research has demonstrated the efficacy of DBLP as a reliable source for bibliographic data in computer science, particularly in specialized domains such as **Computer Vision**.\n\n### Methodology & Data Analysis\n\nThe methodology involved systematic filtering of the ranking platform to isolate relevant data, followed by rigorous cross-verification with Google Scholar. This dual-source approach ensures the accuracy and reliability of the findings.\n\n### Critical Discussion\n\nWhile the ranking system provides valuable insights, it is essential to acknowledge potential limitations:\n- **Bias Toward Established Researchers**: The h-index may favor senior researchers with extensive publication histories over emerging scholars.\n- **Temporal Constraints**: The time range (1970 onward) excludes earlier contributions, which may have been foundational to the field.\n\n### Future Research Directions\n\nFuture studies could explore alternative metrics, such as the **i10-index** or citation velocity, to complement the h-index. Additionally, expanding the analysis to include researchers from underrepresented regions could provide a more comprehensive view of global contributions to **Computer Vision**.\n\n---\n\n"
