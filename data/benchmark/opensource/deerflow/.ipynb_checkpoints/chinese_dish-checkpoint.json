However, I can guide you through a typical recipe based on common practices in Chinese cuisine, which often includes these ingredients.\n\n## Recipe Overview\n\nA typical Chinese-style braised chicken and potatoes dish involves marinating the chicken pieces and then stir-frying them with various seasonings before adding the potatoes and liquid to braise everything together until tender. Cilantro and scallions are commonly used as garnishes or added towards the end of cooking to enhance flavor and aroma.\n\n### Ingredients List\n\n- **Main Ingredients:**\n  - 1 lb chicken pieces (often thighs or drumsticks for more flavor)\n  - 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed\n  - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (for garnish)\n  - 2 tablespoons chopped scallions (both green and white parts)\n\n- **Additional Seasonings:**\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger, minced\n  - 1 tablespoon garlic, minced\n  - 1 tablespoon chili paste (or according to taste)\n  - 1 tablespoon cooking wine (Shaoxing wine is preferred)\n  - 1 teaspoon sugar\n  - 1 teaspoon sesame oil\n  - 1 cup chicken broth (or water)\n  - 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n  - 1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional but adds depth)\n  - Salt and pepper to taste\n\n## Detailed Information\n\nThe preparation method generally involves marinating the chicken pieces with soy sauce, cooking wine, and a bit of sugar for about 20 minutes. The chicken is then stir-fried with minced ginger and garlic until it's lightly browned. Next, the potatoes are added and briefly stir-fried before chili paste and remaining seasonings are introduced. Afterward, chicken broth or water is added, and the mixture is brought to a boil before being reduced to a simmer to braise the chicken and potatoes until they're cooked through and the flavors meld together. Finally, the dish is finished with sesame oil and garnished with cilantro and scallions before serving.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on general practices in Chinese cuisine, especially those involving chicken and potatoes, a recipe has been outlined that includes cilantro and scallions as requested. Additional seasonings beyond oil, salt, MSG, soy sauce, and vinegar include ginger, garlic, chili paste, cooking wine, sugar, and sesame oil. These ingredients would contribute to a richly flavored braised dish similar to what might be found at Foodelicacy.\n\n#",

The recipe should specify the effective use of cilantro and scallions. We also need to list all necessary ingredients and highlight any additional seasonings or condiments required that are not already available in the user's kitchen.\n\n# Research Findings\n\n## Recipe Overview: Smashed Cucumber Salad\n\nA popular cucumber-based salad in Chinese cuisine is the 'Smashed Cucumber Salad,' which is known for its refreshing crunch and vibrant flavors contributed by cilantro and scallions.\n\n### Ingredients List\n\n- **Main Ingredients:**\n  - 2 medium cucumbers\n  - 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro\n  - 2 tablespoons chopped scallions (both green and white parts)\n\n- **Seasonings and Condiments:**\n  - 1 tablespoon minced garlic\n  - 1 teaspoon sugar\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\n  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce\n  - 1 tablespoon black vinegar\n  - 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n  - 1 teaspoon chili oil (optional)\n  - 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns (optional)\n\n## Detailed Information\n\nTo prepare the Smashed Cucumber Salad, start by smashing the cucumbers with the flat side of a knife or a rolling pin to crack them open and then slice into bite-sized pieces. This technique helps the cucumbers absorb the seasonings better. Toss the smashed cucumbers with salt and let them sit for about 10 minutes to draw out excess water, ensuring the salad remains crisp.\n\nIn a separate bowl, mix minced garlic, sugar, soy sauce, black vinegar, sesame oil, and optionally, chili oil and crushed Sichuan peppercorns. Adjust seasoning according to taste. Rinse the salted cucumbers briefly under cold water and pat dry. Combine the cucumbers with the dressing and toss gently to coat evenly.\n\nFinally, garnish with chopped cilantro and scallions just before serving to maintain their fresh flavor and color. This salad is best enjoyed immediately after preparation when the cucumbers are at their crispest.\n\n## Additional Seasonings and Condiments\n\nThe user may need to acquire black vinegar, sesame oil, chili oil, and Sichuan peppercorns if they are not already available in their kitchen. These ingredients contribute to the authentic flavor profile of the salad and are essential for achieving the intended taste.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBased on common practices in Chinese cuisine, the 'Smashed Cucumber Salad' provides a refreshing dish that effectively uses cilantro and scallions for added flavor and aroma. The preparation method involves smashing and salting the cucumbers before tossing them with a seasoned dressing. Highlighted seasonings like black vinegar, sesame oil, chili oil, and Sichuan peppercorns enhance the dishâ€™s unique taste.\n\n#",

Both recipes adhere to this principle, with the braised chicken dish focusing on umami-rich depth and the cucumber salad providing a refreshing counterpoint.\n\n### Methodology & Data Analysis\nThe recipes were derived from established culinary practices documented in reputable sources. Ingredient comparisons were conducted systematically to identify overlaps and streamline preparation.\n\n### Critical Discussion\nWhile the recipes are designed for home cooks, achieving authentic flavor may require access to specific condiments like Shaoxing wine and black vinegar. Substitutions (e.g., rice vinegar for black vinegar) are possible but may alter the intended taste profile.\n\n### Future Research Directions\nFurther exploration could examine regional variations of these dishes or alternative ingredient combinations to accommodate dietary restrictions.\n\n---\n\n## Key Citations\n\n- [Wikipedia - Chinese Imperial Cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine)\n\n- [Wikipedia - Shandong Cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_cuisine)\n\n- [Wikipedia - Sichuan Cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine)\n\n- [The Woks of Life - Smashed Cucumber Salad](https://thewoksoflife.com/smashed-cucumber-salad/)\n\n- [Milk Street - Cilantro, Scallion and Cucumber Salad](https://www.177milkstreet.com/recipes/cilantro-scallion-and-cucumber-salad)\nAsync workflow completed successfully",
