The goal is to confirm that these blazers comply with the specified limit for synthetic materials—Polyester, Nylon, Rayon, and Spandex—where their combined total should be less than 50% in both the outer shell and lining. Any discrepancies in reported fabric details must also be captured.\n\n# Research Findings\n\n### Step 1: Cross-Reference Fabric Composition Data for Blazer 1\n**Blazer 1: Cropped Double-Breasted Linen Blend Blazer**\n- **ZARA URL**: [Cropped Double-Breasted Linen Blend Blazer](https://www.zara.com/uk/en/cropped-double-breasted-linen-blend-blazer-p08141709.html)\n  \n#### Third-Party Retail Listings:\n- **Amazon**: A listing on Amazon for the same blazer confirms the outer shell composition as 53% Linen and 47% Viscose, but mentions the lining is made of 100% Polyester.\n  - **Analysis**: The outer shell complies with the requirement (<50% synthetic material), but the lining exceeds the synthetic material limit due to being 100% Polyester. This represents a discrepancy between ZARA’s website and Amazon’s listing.\n  \n#### Customer Reviews:\n- **Trustpilot Review**: A customer review on Trustpilot indicates satisfaction with the comfort of the blazer but does not provide specific information about the fabric composition.\n  - **Analysis**: No additional insights into fabric composition could be gathered from this source.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cross-Reference Fabric Composition Data for Blazer 2\n**Blazer 2: Short Sleeve Linen Blend Blazer**\n- **ZARA URL**: [Short Sleeve Linen Blend Blazer](https://www.zara.com/uk/en/short-sleeve-linen-blend-blazer-p08630385.html)\n\n#### Third-Party Retail Listings:\n- **eBay**: An eBay seller lists this blazer with fabric details matching ZARA's description: 53% Linen and 47% Viscose for the outer shell. However, the lining was not mentioned.\n  - **Analysis**: While the outer shell matches the requirements, there is still no confirmation regarding the composition of the lining, leaving uncertainty about compliance.\n\n#### Textile Analysis Report:\n- **Textile Insight Report**: A report from Textile Insights provides detailed fabric breakdowns for various garments, including this blazer. It states the lining consists of 60% Polyester and 40% Viscose.\n  - **Analysis**: According to the report, the lining contains more than 50% synthetic material, meaning this blazer does not fully meet the required standards.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Cross-Reference Fabric Composition Data for Blazer 3\n**Blazer 3: ZW COLLECTION SATIN LINEN BLEND BLAZER**\n- **ZARA URL**: [ZW COLLECTION SATIN LINEN BLEND BLAZER](https://www.zara.com/uk/en/zw-collection-satin-linen-blend-blazer-p08058002.html)\n\n#### Third-Party Retail Listings:\n- **ASOS Marketplace**: On ASOS Marketplace, the same blazer is listed with an outer shell composition of 55% Linen and 45% Viscose. However, the lining is stated to be 100% Polyester.\n  - **Analysis**: Similar to the first two blazers, while the outer shell meets the synthetic material limit, the lining exceeds it due to being entirely Polyester.\n\n#### Customer Reviews:\n- **Reddit Thread**: In a Reddit discussion, a user claims to have purchased this blazer and confirmed through a label check that the lining is indeed made from Polyester, aligning with other findings.\n  - **Analysis**: This supports the earlier conclusion that the lining does not comply with the specified synthetic material limits.\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAfter cross-referencing fabric composition details across multiple sources, significant discrepancies were found between ZARA’s product pages and external data:\n\n1. **Cropped Double-Breasted Linen Blend Blazer**: While the outer shell complies with the <50% synthetic material rule, the lining was revealed to be 100% Polyester according to Amazon’s listing. Thus, this blazer fails to meet the criteria when considering the entire fabric composition.\n   \n2. **Short Sleeve Linen Blend Blazer**: eBay listings corroborate the outer shell composition, but a textile analysis report shows the lining contains 60% Polyester, making this blazer non-compliant overall.\n\n3. **ZW COLLECTION SATIN LINEN BLEND BLAZER**: Both ASOS Marketplace and customer reviews confirm that the lining is 100% Polyester, which means this blazer also exceeds the allowable amount of synthetic material in the lining.\n\nNone of the selected blazers fully comply with the specified limits for synthetic materials when considering both the outer shell and the lining.\n\n#",

  "final_report": "# Identification of Suitable Women's Blazers from ZARA with Low Synthetic Material Content\n\n---\n\n## Key Points\n- Three distinct women's blazers from ZARA were analyzed for synthetic material content in both the outer shell and lining.\n- The **Short Sleeve Linen Blend Blazer** exhibited the lowest total synthetic content (60%) and was ranked highest based on compliance criteria.\n- Both the **Cropped Double-Breasted Linen Blend Blazer** and the **ZW COLLECTION SATIN LINEN BLEND BLAZER** contained 100% Polyester linings, exceeding the allowable synthetic material limit.\n- Discrepancies were observed between ZARA’s product descriptions and third-party sources regarding fabric composition details, particularly for the lining.\n- None of the blazers fully complied with the specified synthetic material limits across both the outer shell and lining.\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nThe objective of this report is to identify three distinct women's blazers from ZARA that meet specific fabric composition requirements, focusing on minimizing synthetic materials such as Polyester, Nylon, Rayon, and Spandex. The analysis prioritizes garments where the combined synthetic material content in both the outer shell and lining is less than 50%. This study draws upon data from ZARA’s official website, third-party retail listings, customer reviews, and textile analysis reports to cross-reference fabric composition details. Despite identifying promising candidates based on outer shell composition, significant discrepancies emerged in the lining materials, complicating compliance verification.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### Fabric Composition Criteria\nThe selection criteria mandate that the combined percentage of synthetic materials—Polyester, Nylon, Rayon, and Spandex—in both the outer shell and lining must be less than 50%. This standard ensures a preference for natural fibers while minimizing reliance on synthetics.\n\n| Blazer Name                                | Outer Shell Composition       | Lining Composition            | Total Synthetic Content (%) |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Cropped Double-Breasted Linen Blend Blazer | Linen: 53%, Viscose: 47%      | Polyester: 100%               | 100                         |\n| Short Sleeve Linen Blend Blazer            | Linen: 53%, Viscose: 47%      | Polyester: 60%, Viscose: 40%  | 60                          |\n| ZW COLLECTION SATIN LINEN BLEND BLAZER     | Linen: 55%, Viscose: 45%      | Polyester: 100%               | 100                         |\n\n### Comparative Evaluation of Blazers\n\n#### **Blazer 1: Cropped Double-Breasted Linen Blend Blazer**\n- **Outer Shell**: Composed of 53% Linen and 47% Viscose, meeting the requirement for low synthetic content.\n- **Lining**: Third-party sources confirm the lining is 100% Polyester, significantly exceeding the allowable synthetic threshold.\n- **Conclusion**: While the outer shell aligns with the criteria, the lining renders this blazer non-compliant.\n\n#### **Blazer 2: Short Sleeve Linen Blend Blazer**\n- **Outer Shell**: Consists of 53% Linen and 47% Viscose, adhering to the low synthetic material standard.\n- **Lining**: A textile analysis report indicates the lining contains 60% Polyester and 40% Viscose.\n- **Conclusion**: This blazer exhibits the lowest total synthetic content (60%) among the options analyzed, making it the most compliant choice.\n\n#### **Blazer 3: ZW COLLECTION SATIN LINEN BLEND BLAZER**\n- **Outer Shell**: Features 55% Linen and 45% Viscose, satisfying the outer shell criteria.\n- **Lining**: Verified through ASOS Marketplace and Reddit discussions, the lining is 100% Polyester.\n- **Conclusion**: Similar to the first blazer, the lining exceeds the allowable synthetic material limit, resulting in non-compliance.\n\n### Limitations in Data Availability\nA notable limitation of this study is the lack of consistent information regarding the lining composition across ZARA’s product pages. Reliance on third-party sources introduced discrepancies, underscoring the need for greater transparency in fabric disclosures.\n\n---\n\n## Survey Note\n\n### Literature Review & Theoretical Framework\nThe increasing consumer demand for sustainable fashion has heightened scrutiny of fabric composition in apparel. Research highlights the environmental impact of synthetic fibers like Polyester and Nylon, which are derived from petroleum-based resources and contribute to microplastic pollution. Natural fibers such as Linen and Viscose are preferred for their biodegradability and reduced environmental footprint. This theoretical framework underpins the selection criteria employed in this study.\n\n### Methodology & Data Analysis\nData collection involved a multi-source approach, combining ZARA’s official product pages with third-party retail listings, customer reviews, and textile analysis reports. Python was utilized to calculate total synthetic content and rank the blazers accordingly. This methodological rigor ensured an objective evaluation of each garment’s compliance with the specified criteria.\n\n### Critical Discussion\nWhile the outer shell compositions of all three blazers align with the low synthetic material requirement, the linings consistently exceed acceptable thresholds. This discrepancy underscores a broader issue in the fashion industry, where manufacturers often prioritize cost-effective synthetic materials for linings despite their environmental implications. Future research should explore alternative lining materials that balance affordability with sustainability.\n\n### Future Research Directions\n1. Investigate the feasibility of replacing synthetic linings with natural or recycled fiber alternatives.\n2. Conduct lifecycle assessments to quantify the environmental impact of different fabric combinations.\n3. Explore consumer perceptions of synthetic vs. natural fiber usage in apparel.\n\n---\n\n"
