    "observation_4": "Name: coder\n\n# Plan the Solution\n\nTo validate and organize the product data, I will:\n\n1. **Cross-Check Product Availability**:\n   - Ensure all products (foundations, concealers, and highlighters) are currently available for purchase by visiting their respective links.\n   - Verify that the provided direct links lead to the correct product pages on the official brand websites.\n\n2. **Organize Data in a Structured Format**:\n   - Create a table (using Python's `pandas` library) to store all relevant information about each product, including:\n     - Foundation Name\n     - Brand\n     - Price\n     - Available Shades\n     - Coverage Type\n     - Finish\n     - Direct Link to Foundation\n     - Links to Concealer and Highlighter from the same brand\n\n3. **Validate URLs**:\n   - Use Python's `requests` library to check if each URL is valid and active (i.e., returns an HTTP status code of 200).\n\n4. **Output Final Dataset**:\n   - Print the final dataset as a table and ensure it is well-formatted and easy to read.\n\n5. **Handle Edge Cases**:\n   - If any link is invalid or product is unavailable, note this clearly in the output.\n\n---\n\n# Implementation\n\nI will now implement the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Dataset\nFirst, I will create a structured dataset with all the given

Observations and Insights\n\n- **Fenty Beauty** stands out for its inclusivity, offering an extensive shade range that caters to diverse skin tones.\n- **Estée Lauder** emphasizes longevity and high coverage, appealing to consumers seeking a flawless matte finish.\n- **NARS** targets individuals with normal to dry skin, focusing on radiant and dewy finishes.\n- **Maybelline** provides an affordable yet effective option, making premium-quality makeup accessible to a broader audience.\n- **Giorgio Armani** positions itself as a luxury brand, combining high coverage with a lightweight formula.\n\n---\n\n## Survey Note\n\n### Literature Review & Theoretical Framework\n\nThe cosmetics industry has witnessed significant growth driven by increasing consumer demand for inclusive, high-performance products. Foundations, as a cornerstone of makeup routines, exemplify this trend, with brands innovating to address diverse skin types, tones, and preferences. The theoretical framework for this analysis draws on consumer behavior studies, emphasizing the role of product attributes (shade range, coverage, finish) in purchase decisions.\n\n### Methodology & Data Analysis\n\nThis research employed a systematic approach to identify and validate the top 5 best-selling foundations at Sephora US. Data was sourced from official Sephora and brand websites, ensuring reliability and accuracy. Python's `pandas` and `requests` libraries were utilized for data organization and URL validation, respectively.\n\n### Critical Discussion\n\nWhile the findings provide valuable insights, certain limitations must be acknowledged:\n- The rankings are based on sales performance but may not reflect qualitative assessments such as user satisfaction or dermatological compatibility.\n- The availability of complementary products (concealers and highlighters) is contingent upon brand offerings and may not align perfectly with individual preferences.\n\n### Future Research Directions\n\nFuture studies could explore:\n- Consumer reviews and ratings to complement sales-based rankings.\n- The environmental and ethical implications of foundation formulations.\n- Emerging trends in foundation technology, such as skincare-infused products.\n\n---\n\n"
