A guiding principle of economic policy is the free market system, that is, to allow market forces to determine the pattern of trade. The Singapore Government seeks to ensure that the trading system is open and transparent. Customs and trade documentation procedures are streamlined for smooth flow of goods in and out of Singapore. Singapore does not have any sector-specific policies or trade instruments to promote exports.\nThe private sector is encouraged to play a leading role in economic development while the Government provides an environment conducive for private sector business activities. Fiscal policy is aimed at supporting the private sector in economic development. On the revenue side, the objective is to raise sufficient revenue to finance expenditure while maintaining a competitive tax structure. The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax from April 1994 was to enhance competitiveness of Singapore’s tax structure.\nOn the expenditure side, efforts are made to maintain a small and efficient public sector to release maximum financial and manpower resources to the private sector. Hence, certain operations are being privatised to give them greater autonomy to be run according to commercial practices. This includes telecommunications, broadcasting, electricity and gas etc.\nThe privatization programme in Singapore was undertaken to achieve the following objectives:|\nto withdraw from commercial activities which no longer need to be undertaken by the public sector;\nto add breadth and depth to the Singapore stock market by the flotation of government linked companies and statutory boards and through secondary distribution of government-owned shares;\nto avoid or reduce competition with the private sector;\nto improve efficiency of services through market discipline; and\nto increase the assets of Singaporeans through share ownership in the privatised companies.\nOpportunities\nSingapore’s economic achievement has its origin in trade. Long before its independence, Singapore has served as a port of call between the East and the West. This strategic link is more important now than ever before with the globalization of economies and increasing economic inter-depedence. Accelerated economic development in Asia will emphasize Singapore’s role as a gateway to the region.\nThe key to Singapore’s flourishing international trade has been its free trade policy. Virtually all goods enter Singapore duty-free. Singapore’s political stability, excellent business infrastructure, strategic location, sound legal framework, work class financial services and a pro-business approach have attracted many internation companies to do business with Singapore and to use Singapore as a base for their regional expansion.\nSingapore’s Web site offers information on business and trade opportunities in Singapore. This includes company listings, calendar of trade events, fairs and conventions.\nStatistics\nComprehensive statistics on various aspects of Singapore are listed in the Singapore Web site. Demographic statistics and economic and social indicators are compiled by the Department of Statistics. The Singapore Trade Statistics is published monthly by the Singapore Trade Development Board. Imports and exports are listed by country of origin and by destination. Summary time-series trade statistics is also available.\nDirectories\nThe Singapore Web site provides a comprehensive listings of Singapore’s industries, companies, government bodies and trade associations. The data are provided by the Singapore Government, the Trade Development Board and by various other organisations. Also included is a directory of Web sites containing useful business information in Singapore.\nFor further information on any of the above topics, you may wish to go to Singapore Web Server\nThe ASEAN Secretariat\n70A Jalan Sisingamangaraja\nJakarta 12110\nP: (+6221)7262991, 7243372\nF: (+6221)7398234, 7243504\nM: public@asean.org\nFollow Us\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/ASEAN)\nFacebook-f (https://www.facebook.com/aseansecretariat)\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/asean/)\nYoutube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOp9ttykdbVr6MEkLJ4ZaJQ)\nLinkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-asean-secretariat)\nPrivacy Policy (https://asean.org/highlight-on-singapores-homepage)\n|\nDisclaimer (https://asean.org/disclaimer/)\nSubscribe Now (https://asean.org/highlight-on-singapores-homepage#elementor-action%3Aaction%3Dpopup%3Aopen%26settings%3DeyJpZCI6IjIwOTEyIiwidG9nZ2xlIjpmYWxzZX0%3D)\nto get more updates from asean.org\n© 2025 ASEAN Secretariat.

It recognises the significance of workforce skills for Singapore’s continued economic success and global competitiveness.\n\nSSG offers a wide range of resources to help you adapt, grow, and thrive in the dynamic job market.\n\nIn 2023 alone,\nSkillsFuture empowered over 520,000 individuals (https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/skillsfuture-participation-drops-in-2023-despite-increased-employer-engagement)\nto invest in their professional development.\n\nNotably, nearly 192,000 participants leveraged their SkillsFuture Credits, with a significant majority (95%) utilising them for industry-specific courses, demonstrating a strong focus on career-oriented upskilling and reskilling.\nHistory of SkillsFuture Singapore\nLaunched in 2015, SSG has undergone significant development over the years.

An\nMNC in Singapore\nisn’t just a business entity—it’s a key player in driving the nation’s economic growth and fostering innovation.\nThese companies fuel job creation, support technological advancements, and contribute significantly to Singapore’s global competitiveness. With their extensive networks and resources, MNCs are transforming industries and shaping the future of the economy.\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the pivotal role of MNCs in Singapore, their impact on the economy, and how they inspire groundbreaking innovation.\nOverview of MNC in Singapore\nWhat is MNC in Singapore?\nA\nmultinational corporation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation)\n(MNC) in Singapore is a large company with operations spanning multiple countries, with a significant presence in the city-state. Typically headquartered in another nation, these corporations maintain regional or local offices in Singapore to manage their global activities.\nMNCs in Singapore operate across various industries, including technology, food, logistics, and fashion, contributing to the nation’s dynamic economy.\nThe size and influence of MNCs allow them to create numerous employment opportunities and drive economic growth in Singapore. These corporations thrive by leveraging their vast resources, innovation, and commitment to maintaining consistent standards across international markets, benefiting both the MNCs and the local economy.\nImpact of MNCs on Singapore’s economy\nMNCs play a pivotal role in driving Singapore’s economic growth. Their operations create thousands of jobs across various sectors, strengthening the nation’s workforce. Additionally, they attract substantial foreign direct investments (FDIs), boosting capital flows and fostering economic stability.\nBy partnering with local small and medium enterprises (SMEs), an\nMNC company in Singapore\nstimulates business growth and innovation within the local economy.\nSingapore’s reputation as a global business hub owes much to MNCs, which leverage the city-state’s strategic location and infrastructure to access Southeast Asian markets. Their presence not only enhances Singapore’s global business standing but also fosters a culture of innovation, making the country a magnet for cutting-edge industries.\nWhy MNCs choose Singapore\nSingapore’s appeal as a top destination for\nmultinational companies\nlies in a combination of strategic advantages. The ease of starting and running a business is supported by efficient government processes, ensuring a seamless experience for investors.\nComplementing this is a robust legal framework and low crime rates, providing businesses with the stability and security essential for sustained success.\nSituated in the heart of Southeast Asia, Singapore acts as a gateway to emerging markets. Its exceptional logistics infrastructure and extensive air connectivity make operations more efficient, while comprehensive trade agreements reduce barriers to international commerce.\nAdditionally, the city-state’s dedication to protecting intellectual property ensures that innovations are well safeguarded, fostering confidence among businesses.\nSingapore’s vibrant financial ecosystem further enhances its attractiveness. Companies benefit from easy access to funding and financial services at competitive rates, creating an environment conducive to growth. To entice MNCs, the government offers generous tax incentives and exemptions, encouraging the establishment of regional headquarters.\nWith its stable political climate, unwavering commitment to intellectual property rights, and world-class infrastructure, Singapore provides a solid foundation for businesses to thrive. Together, these factors position Singapore as the destination of choice for MNCs looking to expand their global presence.\nList of multinational companies in Singapore\nSingapore, a global business hub, hosts numerous multinational corporations across diverse industries, drawn by its strategic location, robust infrastructure, and pro-business environment. Below is a\nlist of multinational companies in Singapore\n, categorized by industry.\n1. Tech and innovation\nSingapore’s focus on innovation and technology has attracted leading MNCs that drive advancements in this sector. Companies like\n3M\n,\nIBM\n,\nMicron Semiconductor Asia\n,\nPanasonic Asia Pacific\n, and\nSchneider Electric\nleverage Singapore’s strong research ecosystem and skilled talent pool.\nThese MNCs not only enhance the industry but also contribute to building Singapore’s reputation as a regional innovation hub.\n2. Advisory services\nThe advisory sector thrives in Singapore, with global firms providing essential services to businesses navigating complex markets. Leading names such as\nErnst & Young\n,\nAccenture\n,\nKPMG\n,\nDeloitte\n, and\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\ndeliver expertise in consulting, auditing, and strategy.\nThese MNCs benefit from Singapore’s stable economy and its position as a gateway to Southeast Asia.\n3. Banking\nSingapore’s banking industry is bolstered by a mix of local and international MNCs.\nUOB\n,\nCitibank\n,\nMayBank\n,\nOCBC Bank\n, and\nStandard Chartered Bank\nserve as pillars of the financial ecosystem. These banks are drawn to Singapore for its regulatory efficiency, financial stability, and role as a global wealth management hub.\n4. Energy & industrial\nIn the energy and industrial sectors, major players like\nExxonMobil\n,\nShell\n,\nGeneral Electric\n,\nSiemens\n,\nCaterpillar\n, and\nSembcorp\nare integral to Singapore’s industrial growth. These companies are attracted by Singapore’s advanced logistics capabilities and its position as a regional energy hub.\n5. Consumer goods and retail\nMNC companies in Singapore like Procter & Gamble, Fraser & Neave, McDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Dairy Farm International dominate Singapore’s consumer goods and retail sector. Their presence is supported by Singapore’s vibrant consumer market and efficient supply chain infrastructure.\n6. Healthcare & pharmaceuticals\nSingapore is a key hub for healthcare and pharmaceutical MNCs, including GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, and Novartis. These firms capitalize on the country’s strong intellectual property protection and access to regional markets.\n7. Real estate & hospitality\nThe real estate and hospitality sectors are powered by MNCs such as Far East Organization, MapleTree Group, CapitaLand, Marina Bay Sands, and InterContinental Hotels Group. Singapore’s reputation as a global tourism and business destination makes it an ideal base for these companies.\nWhat to consider before establishing an MNC in Singapore\nLegal considerations\nUnderstanding and adhering to Singapore’s legal requirements is crucial for businesses seeking to establish themselves in the region. All companies must register with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), adhering to several key requirements:\nAt least one director must be a Singapore resident, such as a citizen or Employment Pass holder.\nCompanies must appoint a local company secretary within six months of incorporation.\nA physical Singapore address is mandatory for the company’s registered office.\nAdditionally, while the minimum paid-up capital for most companies is just SGD 1, certain sectors require higher amounts. For instance, insurance intermediary firms must have a minimum paid-up capital of SGD 300,000.\nBy partnering with a corporate service provider, like BBCIncorp, MNCs can navigate these requirements seamlessly, laying a solid legal foundation for operations in Singapore and across Asia. These services ensure compliance, mitigate risks, and provide ongoing support, allowing businesses to focus on growth.\nLogistical and strategic planning\nSetting up operations in Singapore demands careful logistical and strategic planning. From securing office spaces to hiring skilled talent, every step plays a critical role in establishing a strong business base.\nSingapore’s world-class transport infrastructure, including Changi Airport and extensive shipping facilities, offers unparalleled connectivity, making it a natural gateway to Asia’s emerging markets.\nFor businesses expanding globally, outsourcing logistics can be a prudent choice. Third-party providers handle intricate supply chain processes, including documentation and compliance, ensuring efficient and timely delivery of goods.\nAdditionally, developing a localized strategy through research and partnerships helps companies adapt to market nuances, further enhancing their growth trajectory.\nChallenges to anticipate\nWhile Singapore offers a conducive environment for MNCs, businesses should prepare for potential hurdles. High operational costs, intense market competition, and global uncertainties can pose challenges.\nCompanies must adopt strategic approaches, such as leveraging government incentives, fostering innovation, and maintaining operational efficiency, to mitigate these issues.\nProactive planning, including robust cost management and market research, helps businesses stay competitive. Moreover, building resilience through flexible strategies and continuous adaptation to external changes ensures long-term sustainability in a dynamic global market.\nSingapore’s supportive business ecosystem, strategic location, and infrastructure provide immense opportunities for MNCs, but success hinges on meticulous preparation and adaptability.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the presence of\nMNC in Singapore\nhas been pivotal in driving economic growth and fostering innovation. With its strategic location, robust infrastructure, and pro-business environment, Singapore continues to attract leading global corporations across diverse industries.\nFor businesses looking to tap into this thriving ecosystem, ensuring a strong legal foundation and seamless incorporation process is essential.

Within a very short period of time, largely because of the use of English common law and other regulatory advantages over the surrounding area, Singapore became a powerful economic engine. In fact, right now Singapore is one of the top six cities in the world....These cities are governed by regulatory systems that deliver open trade, property rights protection, the rule of law and merit-based competition that creates an environment where insurgent companies can actually be successful. There is nothing in the way of an entrepreneur’s vision and dreams. \"\n> \n> \n> Shanker Singham\n\n![Image 2: A view of the city skyline at night.](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Singapore_Skyline_Wikimedia_2560x519.webp)\n\nThe case of Singapore’s Economic Miracle highlights the impact of building a nation on the basis of the Three Pillars.\n\nSingapore today has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, currently outdoing the US, and well beyond the UK. And the rate at which they developed their powerhouse economy is outstanding.\n\n![Image 3: A line graph showing the gdp per capita for different countries.](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/smush-webp/2024/04/GDPPerCapitaSingUSUK_569x372.png.webp)\n\n![Image 4: Singapore annual gdp at current parket prices](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/smush-webp/2024/04/GDPedited_491x306.jpg.webp)\n\nStarting with their 1965 separation from the Malaysian Federation, Singapore faced on their own, the daunting task of replacing their role as the transshipment point and major naval base for the British Empire in Southeast Asia. They chose to establish themselves as an independent economic force, and in an entirely new national direction.\n\n**S**ingapore’s Stages of Economic Development\n\nBetween the 1960’s and the 2000’s, Singapore went through the following phases: Labor intensive, skill intensive, capital intensive, technology intensive, and, finally, innovation intensive. (See the IMF study Breaking the Oil Spell: The Gulf Falcons’ Path to Diversification, [Chapter 3](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/display/book/9781513537863/ch004.xml), entitled “Going Beyond Comparative Advantage: How Singapore Did It” by Phillip Yeo.)\n\nIncome per capita went from $428 per year to $54,000 per year (US dollars). In 2022, Singapore’s per capita income was $83,000.\n\n![Image 5: A line graph showing the growth of capital and technology.](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/smush-webp/2023/10/fivephasessingaporedepartmentofstatistics.jpg.webp)\n\nBy the 1970’s, manufacturing had become a significant percentage of Singapore’s GDP, which was an initial crucial step away from their previous existence as a British outpost.\n\nThe Singapore government’s role in this development was, of course, significant in these early stages.\n\nThe land was developed to establish areas suitable for industry and manufacturing, and this included the improvement of internal waterways.\n\nHousing and health care were provided for the population. Singapore’s government also played a major role in the education system, which was crucial for the nation to move forward towards greater skill sets and innovation.\n\nLooking to the outside world, Singapore’s leaders realized they needed to attract foreign investment, which they accomplished with great success.\n\nElectronics and computer parts, including software and chips, were amongst some of the types of companies which established facilities in Singapore. In 1969, Texas Instruments opened a plant in Singapore, beginning a flood of foreign investment.\n\nSingapore, with the collaboration of foreign nations and multi-national corporations, established training centers in order to upgrade the skill level of its citizens. But, as is typical in Singapore’s free market thinking, the nation also adopted a liberal policy towards immigration of highly skilled foreign nationals in order to fill the gap of needed expertise.\n\nContrary to various prejudices against “cheap foreign labor”, in the 1980’s Singapore embarked upon its “Second Industrial Revolution” – the push towards capital-intensive industries.\n\nBy the 90’s, Singapore set its sights on becoming a “first world” nation in every respect. This included a shift towards knowledge and innovation. This was fully accomplished in the 2000’s.\n\nToday, Singapore is a fully diversified and forward-driven nation. (See chart summarizing GNP by sector.) Watch the video below for a quick summary of Singapore’s resiliency, including how they survived the economic blow of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nToday, Singapore is a fully diversified and forward-driven nation. (See chart summarizing GNP by sector.) Watch the video below for a quick summary of Singapore’s resiliency, including how they survived the economic blow of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThroughout this period, Singapore did not impose restrictions on foreign companies’ investments into their nation, imposed virtually no tariffs, and very little regulation preventing foreign entities from setting up shop in their city-state. Their pro-competitive and common law based regulatory environment also enabled foreign investors to be successful.\n\nIn the first stage, Singapore focused upon more labor-intensive industry. This included various consumer items for export, such as textiles, toys, wood products, and many more. (All data from Singapore Department of Statistics unless otherwise indicated).\n\n![Image 6: A pie chart showing the number of business and other sectors.](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/smush-webp/2023/10/Share-of-Singapore-GDP-by-Industry2013IMF.jpg.webp)\n\n**In Summary**\n\nSingapore in 2023 again achieved first place in the Heritage Foundation’s “[Index of Economic Freedom](https://rb.gy/grhyin)”.\n\nSome of Singapore’s unique features include:\n\n*   Virtually no foreign debt\n*   Government civil service based upon meritocracy\n*   Virtually no tariffs\n*   Few regulations impeding new business creation, including by foreign companies\n*   Near the top of the [Global Competitive Index](https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/) (World Economic Forum)\n*   Business friendly low tax rates\n*   Average growth rate of 9.2% in first 25 years, 7.7% until today\n*   Highest rank (2020) in the World Bank’s [World Capital Index](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital), indicating level of investment in the development of its people. (The chart below shows numbers of Research Scientists and Engineers.)\n\n![Image 7: A bar graph showing the growth of private sector rses.](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/smush-webp/2023/10/Research-Scientists-and-Engineers-1990%E2%88%922012.jpg.webp)\n\n![Image 8: A bar graph showing the number of students in each school.](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/smush-webp/2023/10/Research-and-Development-Expenditure-by-Sector.jpg.webp)\n\nThere is no doubt that Lee Kwon Yue accomplished Singapore’s Economic Miracle with a heavy hand against internal political opposition, corruption, and sometimes, personal political liberty. But as Dr. Henry Kissinger states in his preface to Lee Kuan Yew’s From Third World to First, “… The long-established nations of the West have fallen prey to the temptation of ignoring history and judging each state by the criteria of their own civilizations.”\n\nWe of the Competere Foundation, point to Singapore, and other cases, such as Dubai, to prove how adherence to the principles of The Three Pillars provides a model for success.\n\n(Watch the video below for a wonderful overview of Singapore’s historic transformation.)\n\nSingapore and the three pillars\n-------------------------------\n\nCompetition within the Border\n-----------------------------\n\n*   The government of Singapore has been increasing its commitment to an innovation-based economy, which is focused on growing its domestic start- ups based largely upon new technology.\n*   Singapore provides an excellent environment for establishing such domestic enterprise by its investment in the quality of education and workforce development. Venture funds have been aided by the government, providing support for new ventures and scaling them upwards.\n*   Singapore’s extraordinary infrastructure includes cutting edge development around green technology, smart-city technology, and water management. By setting benchmark goals in these areas, local innovation based upon competition is fostered.\n\nOpen Trade\n----------\n\n*   Ranks number one in the Heritage Foundation’s 2023[“Index of Economic Freedom.”](https://www.heritage.org/index/country/singapore) That report states: “The trade regime is open and competitive, and no tariffs are imposed on imports. The law treats foreign and domestic businesses equally, and nearly all sectors of the economy are open to 100 percent foreign ownership. The financial sector is highly competitive and resilient.”\n*   More than 25 Free Trade Agreements.\n*   Hosts ” a diverse group of shipping companies providing a wide spectrum of maritime services such as ship management, ship agency, broking, finance, insurance, legal and arbitration, survey, and research and development” says Lim. ([Quote](https://new.abb.com/news/detail/78949/smart-port-smart-nation-singapore-builds-on-spectrum-of-strengths) from Kenneth Lim, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore).\n\nProperty Rights Protection\n--------------------------\n\n*   Singapore ranks first in Asia and second globally on the [International Property Rights Index](https://www.internationalpropertyrightsindex.org/country/singapore#:~:text=Singapore's%20IPRI%20score%20decreased%20by,and%202nd%20in%20the%20world.) for 2023. This ranking includes very high scores in the following areas:\n    *   Intellectual property rights protection\n    *   Physical property rights protection\n    *   Financing access\n    *   Registration process\n\n*   Singapore’s legal system, originating in British Common Law, provides a reliable business-friendly environment. Singapore has received high scores for the independence of its judiciary and rule-of law.\n*   Famous for anti-corruption laws and a high-level of government integrity.\n*   Streamlined business regulations with low tax rates.\n\n*   Singapore is the leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific. It ranks third in the Global Financial Centre Index 2022, trailing only New York and London.\n*   Singapore has risen in ranks to be the second preferred destination for cross-border investment in 2023, behind Tokyo.\n*   The largest transshipment port in the world, accounting for 20% of the world’s transshipments. Singapore lies along the Straits of Malacca, close to the lowest-distance route between many European and Asian countries.\n*   The second busiest port in the world, connected to 600 ports and with 130,000 vessels docking every year.\n*   Singapore ranks 6th out of 154 countries in the Global Knowledge Index 2021. (Knowledge- based economy)\n*   Singapore is one of the most wired countries and technologically advanced Information and Communications Technology (ICT) markets in the world. Also, one of the leading smart cities in the world.\n*   Singapore ranks 7th in the World Index of Health Care Innovation. Ranked #1 in Asia for their health care system, and the #2 global destination for medical tourism.\n*   A leader [in formulating a long-term plan for managing climate change](https://theconversation.com/how-singapores-water-management-has-become-a-global-model-for-how-to-tackle-climate-crisis-162117) and is steadfastly implementing that plan.\n*   Leader in cutting-edge technology for [providing clean water](https://utilityweek.co.uk/how-singapore-became-a-world-leader-in-water-resilience/).\n*   Singapore’s traditional key industries: Electronics, chemicals, financial services, oil drilling equipment, petroleum refining, biomedical products, scientific instruments, telecommunication equipment, processed food and beverages, ship repair, offshore platform construction\n\nNote: The top photo is a picture of Singapore’s mascot, the Merlion.

In general, it is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of resources.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-4) A given economy is a set of processes that involves its [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture \"Culture\"), [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Values \"Values\"), education, technological evolution, history, [social organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_organization \"Social organization\"), [political structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_structure \"Political structure\"), [legal systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_systems \"Legal systems\"), and [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource \"Natural resource\") as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand alone.\n\nEconomic agents can be individuals, [businesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business \"Business\"), [organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization \"Organization\"), or [governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government \"Government\"). Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency \"Currency\"). However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain.\n\nEconomic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital. It has changed over time due to [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology \"Technology\"), [innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation \"Innovation\") (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) and changes in [industrial relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_relations \"Industrial relations\") (most notably [child labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour \"Child labour\") being replaced in some parts of the world with [universal access to education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_access_to_education \"Universal access to education\")).\n\nEtymology\n---------\n\n[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Luchtfoto_van_Lower_Manhattan.jpg/250px-Luchtfoto_van_Lower_Manhattan.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Luchtfoto_van_Lower_Manhattan.jpg)\n\n[New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), the world's principal [fintech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech \"Fintech\") and [financial center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_center \"Financial center\")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-NewYorkFintechAndFinancialCapitalWorld-5)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-6) and the epicenter of the [world's principal metropolitan economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_GDP \"List of cities by GDP\")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-NYCEpicenterUSMetroEconomy-7)\n\nThe word _economy_ in English is derived from the [Middle French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_French \"Middle French\")'s _yconomie_, which itself derived from the [Medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin \"Medieval Latin\")'s _[oeconomia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oeconomia \"wikt:oeconomia\")_. The Latin word has its origin at the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek \"Ancient Greek\")'s _oikonomia_ or _oikonomos_. The word's first part _oikos_ means \"house\", and the second part _nemein_ means \"to manage\".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-:0-8)\n\nThe most frequently used current sense, denoting \"the economic system of a country or an area\", seems not to have developed until the 1650s.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-9)\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Earliest roots\n\n[![Image 4: see caption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/BosraMosaicCamels.png/250px-BosraMosaicCamels.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BosraMosaicCamels.png)\n\nAncient Roman mosaic from [Bosra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosra \"Bosra\"), depicting a merchant leading camels through the desert\n\nAs long as someone has been making, supplying and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex. [Sumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer \"Sumer\") developed a large-scale economy based on [commodity money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money \"Commodity money\"), while the [Babylonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonians \"Babylonians\") and their neighboring [city states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_states \"City states\") later developed the earliest system of [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics \"Economics\") as we think of, in terms of rules/laws on [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt \"Debt\"), legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices, and private property.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-Sheila-10)\n\nThe Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-yale2-11)\n\nThe ancient economy was based primarily on [subsistence farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_farming \"Subsistence farming\").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-12) The [Shekel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekel \"Shekel\") are the first to refer to a unit of weight and currency, used by the [Semitic peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_peoples \"Semitic peoples\"). The first usage of the term came from [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia \"Mesopotamia\") circa 3000 BC. and referred to a specific mass of [barley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley \"Barley\") which related other values in a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) \"Metric (mathematics)\") such as silver, bronze, copper, etc. A barley/shekel was originally both a unit of [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency \"Currency\") and a unit of weight, just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one-pound mass of silver.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-brony-13)\n\nMost exchange of goods had occurred through social relationships. There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. In [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece \"Ancient Greece\"), where the present English word 'economy' originated,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-:0-8) many people were [bond slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_slaves \"Bond slaves\") of the [freeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeholder_(government) \"Freeholder (government)\").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-14) The economic discussion was driven by [scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity \"Scarcity\").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn Chinese economic law, the huge cycle of [institutional innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution \"Institution\") contains an idea. Serving a non-market economy promotes a firm's tenure that is legally guaranteed and protected from bureaucratic opportunities.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-15)\n\n### Middle Ages\n\nIn the Middle Ages, what is now known as an economy was not far from the subsistence level. Most exchange occurred within [social groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_groups \"Social groups\"). On top of this, the great conquerors raised what we now call [venture capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital \"Venture capital\") (from _ventura_, ital.; _risk_) to finance their captures. The [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics) \"Capital (economics)\") should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the [New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World \"New World\"). The discoveries of [Marco Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo \"Marco Polo\") (1254–1324), [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus \"Christopher Columbus\") (1451–1506) and [Vasco da Gama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama \"Vasco da Gama\") (1469–1524) led to a first [global](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization \"Globalization\") economy. The first [enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company \"Company\") were trading establishments. In 1513, the first [stock exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange \"Stock exchange\") was founded in [Antwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp \"Antwerp\"). Economy at the time meant primarily [trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade \"Trade\").\n\nThe European captures became branches of the [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe \"Europe\") states, the so-called [colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonies \"Colonies\").

Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the [citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens \"Citizens\") of a state.\n\n### Industrial Revolution\n\nThe first [economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist \"Economist\") in the true modern meaning of the word was the Scotsman [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith \"Adam Smith\") (1723–1790) who was inspired partly by the ideas of [physiocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiocracy \"Physiocracy\"), a reaction to mercantilism and also later Economics student, Adam Mari.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-16) He defined the elements of a national economy: [products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business) \"Product (business)\") are offered at a [natural price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_price \"Natural price\") generated by the use of [competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition \"Competition\") - [supply and demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand \"Supply and demand\") - and the [division of labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labor \"Division of labor\"). He maintained that the basic motive for [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade \"Free trade\") is human self-interest. The so-called self-interest hypothesis became the [anthropological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropological \"Anthropological\") basis for economics. [Thomas Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Malthus \"Thomas Malthus\") (1766–1834) transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of [overpopulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation \"Human overpopulation\").\n\nThe [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution \"Industrial Revolution\") was a period from the 18th to the 19th century where major changes in [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture \"Agriculture\"), [manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing \"Manufacturing\"), [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining \"Mining\"), and [transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport \"Transport\") had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"), then subsequently spreading throughout [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe \"Europe\"), [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America \"North America\"), and eventually the world.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-17) The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some way. In Europe wild [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism \"Capitalism\") started to replace the system of [mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism \"Mercantilism\") (today: [protectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism \"Protectionism\")) and led to [economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth \"Economic growth\"). The period is called the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution \"Industrial Revolution\") because the system of [production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(economics) \"Production (economics)\") and [division of labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labor \"Division of labor\") enabled the [mass production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production \"Mass production\") of [goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_(economics) \"Good (economics)\").\n\n### 20th century\n\nThe contemporary concept of \"the economy\" wasn't popularly known until the American [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\") in the 1930s.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-invention-18)\n\nAfter the chaos of two [World Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War \"World War\") and the devastating Great Depression, policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] This was explored and discussed by [Friedrich August von Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_August_von_Hayek \"Friedrich August von Hayek\") (1899–1992) and [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman \"Milton Friedman\") (1912–2006) who pleaded for a global [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade \"Free trade\") and are supposed to be the fathers of the so-called [neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism \"Neoliberalism\").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-Boas20092-19)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-20) However, the prevailing view was that held by [John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes \"John Maynard Keynes\") (1883–1946), who argued for a stronger control of the [markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics) \"Market (economics)\") by the state. The theory that the state can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called [Keynesianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesianism \"Keynesianism\") in his honor.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-21) In the late 1950s, the economic growth in America and Europe—often called _[Wirtschaftswunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder \"Wirtschaftswunder\")_ (German for _economic miracle_) —brought up a new form of economy: [mass consumption economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_consumption_economy \"Mass consumption economy\"). In 1958, [John Kenneth Galbraith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith \"John Kenneth Galbraith\") (1908–2006) was the first to speak of an [affluent society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluent_society \"Affluent society\") in his book _[The Affluent Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Affluent\\_Society \"The Affluent Society\")_.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-22) In most of the countries the economic system is called a [social market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy \"Social market economy\").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-23)\n\n### 21st century\n\n[![Image 5: see caption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange_%28Ank_Kumar%29_02.jpg/250px-Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange_%28Ank_Kumar%29_02.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange_(Ank_Kumar)_02.jpg)\n\n[Frankfurt Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange \"Frankfurt Stock Exchange\") in 2015\n\nWith [the fall of the Iron Curtain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 \"Revolutions of 1989\") and the transition of the countries of the Eastern Bloc towards democratic government and market economies, the idea of the [post-industrial society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-industrial_society \"Post-industrial society\") is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the [service sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_sector \"Service sector\") receives instead of industrialization. Some attribute the first use of this term to Daniel Bell's 1973 book, _The Coming of Post-Industrial Society_, while others attribute it to social philosopher Ivan Illich's book, _[Tools for Conviviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools\\_for\\_Conviviality \"Tools for Conviviality\")_. The term is also applied in philosophy to designate the fading of [postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism \"Postmodernism\") in the late 90s and especially in the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nWith the spread of [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet \"Internet\") as a mass media and communication medium especially after 2000–2001, the idea for the Internet and [information economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_economy \"Information economy\") is given place because of the growing importance of [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce \"E-commerce\") and electronic businesses, also the term for a global information society as understanding of a new type of \"all-connected\" society is created. In the late 2000s, the new type of economies and economic expansions of countries like [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Century \"Chinese Century\"), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_as_an_emerging_superpower \"Brazil as an emerging superpower\"), and [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_as_a_potential_superpower \"India as a potential superpower\") bring attention and interest to economies different from the usually dominating Western-type economies and economic models.\n\nElements\n--------\n\n### Types\n\nA [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy \"Market economy\") is one where [goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_(economics) \"Good (economics)\") and [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics) \"Service (economics)\") are produced and exchanged according to [demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand \"Demand\") and [supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_(economics) \"Supply (economics)\") between participants (economic agents) by [barter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter \"Barter\") or a [medium of exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange \"Medium of exchange\") with a [credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_(finance) \"Credit (finance)\") or [debit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit \"Debit\")[value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics) \"Value (economics)\") accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-24) A [planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy \"Planned economy\") is one where political agents directly control what is produced and how it is sold and distributed.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-25) A [green economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_economy \"Green economy\") is [low-carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon \"Low-carbon\") and resource efficient.

The economic growth took place mostly in mining, construction and manufacturing industries. [Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce \"Commerce\") became more significant due to the need for improved exchange and distribution of produce throughout the community.\n*   In the economies of modern [consumer societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_society \"Consumer society\") phase there is a growing part played by [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics) \"Service (economics)\"), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance \"Finance\"), and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology \"Technology\")—the [knowledge economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy \"Knowledge economy\").\n\nIn modern economies, these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed by the [three-sector model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model \"Three-sector model\"):[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-28)\n\n*   [Primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector_of_the_economy \"Primary sector of the economy\"): Involves the extraction and production of [raw materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_materials \"Raw materials\"), such as [corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain \"Grain\"), [coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal \"Coal\"), [wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood \"Wood\") and [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron \"Iron\").\n*   [Secondary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy \"Secondary sector of the economy\"): Involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into [cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars \"Cars\"), or [textiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textiles \"Textiles\") into clothing.\n*   [Tertiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy \"Tertiary sector of the economy\"): Involves the provision of [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics) \"Service (economics)\") to consumers and businesses, such as [baby-sitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby-sitting \"Baby-sitting\"), [cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film \"Film\") and [banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking \"Banking\").\n\nOther sectors of the developed community include:\n\n*   the [public sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector \"Public sector\") or state sector (which usually includes: parliament, law-courts and government centers, various emergency services, public health, shelters for impoverished and threatened people, transport facilities, air/sea ports, post-natal care, hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, preserved historical buildings, parks/gardens, nature-reserves, some universities, national sports grounds/stadiums, national arts/concert-halls or theaters and centers for various religions).\n*   the [private sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector \"Private sector\") or privately run businesses.\n*   the [voluntary sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_sector \"Voluntary sector\") or social sector.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-29)\n\n### Indicators\n\nThe [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product \"Gross domestic product\") (GDP) of a country is a measure of the size of its economy, or more specifically, monetary measure of the market value of all the [final goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good \"Final good\") and services produced.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-30) The most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the GDP and [GDP per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_per_capita \"GDP per capita\").

He left Calcutta and set out to explore much of South-East Asia. At the time, the Dutch Empire and British Empire were close economic rivals. Colonization enabled these empires to gain control of the vast resources of militarily weaker and economically less prosperous\nnations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nations)\n. Raffles was looking for a new settlement that could replace Malacca as a key economic advantage over the Dutch Empire. The former had been handed over to the Dutch under the\nTreaty of Vienna of 1815 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Vienna_(1815))\n.\n[55] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-58)\nRaffles found Singapore to be a perfect location, sitting just of the edge of the Straits of Malacca, nowadays one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. As well, the territory had key economic resources which would benefit the British. There was abundant timber and fresh water, and a natural deep water harbor which would be beneficial for the British fleet. He arrived on an island at the mouth of the Singapore River, where there was a small Malay settlement. At the time  accompanied by William Farquhar, Raffles met with\nTemenggong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temenggong)\n(essentially, Chief of Security, for the settlement)\nAbdul Rahman (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temenggong_Abdul_Rahman)\nto negotiate the right to establish a trading post on the island, under the British Empire. The island was ruled nominally from\nJohar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor_Sultanate)\non the peninsula by\nTengku (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengku)\n(essentially, Prince)\nRahman, Sultan of Johor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rahman_Muazzam_Shah_of_Johor)\n, who was heavily influenced by the Dutch and the\nBugis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugis)\n. However, the Sultanate was weakened by factional division so that Temenggong Abdul Rahman and his officials were more loyal to Rahman's elder brother Tengku\nHussein (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor)\n(or Tengku Long) who was living in exile in “Riau” (likely\nthe Riau Archipelago (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riau_Archipelago)\n). With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Hussein back to Singapore. He offered to recognize Hussein as the rightful Sultan of Johor and provide him with a yearly\nstipend (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipend)\n; in return, Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nOn 6 February 1819 Raffles succeeded in having the territory formally incorporated into the British Empire as the aforementioned trading post.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nMuch of the settlement’s rapid economic growth thereafter can be credited to its natural suitability as a seaport hub.\n[56] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-59)\nTrade expansion\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=5)\n]\nOn 17 November 1869, the\nSuez Canal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal)\nopens, connecting the\nMediterranean Sea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea)\nto the\nRed Sea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea)\n. This allowed for a decrease in travel time, which resulted in a rise in trade volume.

With spurs of race riots the colonial powers sought to empower and establish a formidable local government. With most of the unrest resulting from high unemployment, the local government was directed to solve this issue.\n[54] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-Lim_2015-57)\nThe\nEconomic Development Board (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Development_Board)\nwas formed to empower the Singapore government in establishing, developing, and financing industrial undertakings.\n[59] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-62)\nIn 1955, a Singapore local legislative Assembly with 25 out of 35 members elected was formed.\n[60] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-63)\nUpon independence from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore faced a small domestic market, and high levels of unemployment and poverty. 70 percent of Singapore's households lived in badly overcrowded conditions, and a third of its people squatted in slums on the city fringes. Unemployment averaged 14 percent, GDP per capita was US$516, and half of the population was illiterate\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\n.\nIndustrialisation boom and change\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=7)\n]\nAfter\nLee Kuan Yew (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew)\nwas elected, he oversaw significant economic reforms to the country. Structural change and machinery propelled the economy during his tenure. Singapore was a small and densely populated nation, with very few natural resources and little space to grow outwards. Recognizing this, Lee identified that the key advantage that Singapore held was its human capital, and its ability to provide highly educated citizens capable of competing in global industry and trade. On 1 August 1961, the Singapore Government established the\nEconomic Development Board (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Development_Board)\nto spearhead an investment drive, and make Singapore an attractive destination for foreign investment.\n[61] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-Huff_1995-64)\nFDI inflows increased greatly over the following decades, and by 2001 foreign companies accounted for 75% of manufactured output and 85% of manufactured exports. Meanwhile, Singapore's savings and investment rates rose among the highest levels in the world, while household consumption and wage shares of GDP fell among the lowest.\n[62] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-65)\n[63] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-66)\n[64] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-67)\nThe beginning of Lee's tenure was marked with success and from 1965–1973, annual growth of real GDP was 12.7%. He directed spending to repair and improve infrastructure. This effort spurred economic productivity and put in place the foundations needed to build up basic industry. As of 2019, Singapore's infrastructure is ranked the best in terms of quality, with a score of 95.4 out of 100.\n[65] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-68)\nThe period from 1973-1979 marked a struggle for Singapore as they pivoted away from basic infrastructure spending and moved towards more sustainable economic progress. The 1973 oil crisis raised government awareness of issues such as economic concentration. It forced the government to hold new forum to discuss ways of adapting the countries economy to economic change. GDP growth during this time was slightly lower than the preceding years, at 8.5% annually. However, unemployment was virtually 0%, and most of the population had experienced great strides in productivity.\n[66] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-69)\nThe government highlighted a focus in technology and education to be the new wave of economic gain.\n[67] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-70)\nIn addition, they identified financial services as a key area in which Singapore could diversify and attract new growth. During this time, the government invested heavily in its budding financial services industry. It managed to minimize inflation and provide workers with the proper equipment and machinery to sustain growth.\nRecent history\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=8)\n]\nGrowth in the service sector\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=9)\n]\nAs a result of this investment drive, Singapore's capital stock increased 33 times by 1992, and achieved a tenfold increase in the capital-labour ratio.\n[68] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-71)\nLiving standards steadily rose, with more families moving from a lower-income status to middle-income security with increased household incomes.\nIn 1987, Lee claimed that (based on the government's home ownership criterion) 80% of Singaporeans could now be considered to be members of the middle-class. Under Lee, Singapore had both low inflation and unemployment. However, much unlike the economic policies of Greece and the rest of Europe, Singapore followed a policy of individualising the social safety net. This led to a higher than average savings rate and a very sustainable economy in the long run. Without a burdensome welfare state or its likeliness, Singapore has developed a very self-reliant and skilled workforce well versed for a global economy.\n[69] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-72)\nIn the late 1980s, Singapore's export-driven economic model required adjustment for further development.\n[70] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-:8-73)\n: 79\nThe 1990s emergence of efficient manufacturing firms in southeast Asia challenged the nation with such a small labor force and land restrictions.

In 2005, economic growth was 6.4%; and in 2006, 7.9%.\nIt was apparent that Singapore would also struggle due to the\n2008 financial crisis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis)\ngiven its status as a financial services hub. Some market commentators doubted the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the crisis.

workforce\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=19)\n]\nIn 2000, Singapore had a workforce of about 2.2 million. With limited access to natural resources, Singapore had been forced to invest in its people.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nThe country has the largest proficiency of English language speakers in Asia, making it an attractive place for multinational corporations. Singapore has come a long way from where it once stood. In the 1970s according to Tilak Abeysinghe  \"2.4 percent of the labor force were degree holders\". By 1990 the number rose to just 6.3%. In 2013 the percentage of the labor force who held degrees reached 31%. The nation's directive toward high skilled labor jobs, has promoted both growth and education to the region.\n[120] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-123)\nThe\nNational Trades Union Congress (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress)\n(NTUC), the sole trade union federation, which has a symbiotic relationship with the ruling party, accounts for almost 99% of total organised labour. Government policy and pro-activity rather than labour legislation controls general labour and trade union matters.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nThe Employment Act offers little protection to white-collar workers due to an income threshold. The Industrial Arbitration Court handles labour-management disputes that cannot be resolved informally through the Ministry of Manpower. The\nSingapore Government (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Government)\nhas stressed the importance of co-operation between unions, management and government (\ntripartism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartism)\n), as well as the early resolution of disputes. There has been only one strike in the past 15 years.\nSingapore has enjoyed virtually full employment for long periods of time. Amid an economic slump, the unemployment rate rose to 4.0% by the end of 2001, from 2.4% early in the year. Unemployment has since declined and as of 2012 the unemployment rate stands at 1.9%.\n[121] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-124)\nWhile the Singapore government has taken a stance against\nminimum wage (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage)\nand\nunemployment benefit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefit)\nschemes, in 2007 the government introduced a Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme to supplement wages of low-skilled workers.\n[122] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-Workfare-125)\nTo support employers in hiring older Singaporean workers, Special Employment Credit (SEC) was introduced in 2011. It was first enhanced in 2012 to provide employers with support in hiring older Singaporean workers and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). It helped the employers to cope with costs associated with the increase in Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates for older workers. The 5-year SEC scheme was further extended an additional 3 years, up to 2019 to encourage employers to voluntarily re-employ older workers aged 65 and above.\n[123] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-126)\nThe Singapore Government and the NTUC have tried a range of programs to increase lagging productivity and boost the labour force participation rates of women and older workers. However, labour shortages persist in the service sector and in many low-skilled positions in the construction and electronics industries. Foreign workers help make up this shortfall. In 2000, there were about 600,000 foreign workers in Singapore, constituting 27% of the total work force. As a result, wages are relatively suppressed or do not rise for all workers. To have some controls, the government imposes a foreign worker levy payable by employers for low end workers like domestic help and construction workers.\n[124] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-127)\nIn 2012, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) reported that Singapore should continue to fine-tune the calibration of its inflow of foreigners as the country continues to face an ageing population and a shrinking workforce. Singapore Parliament accepted the recommendations by its Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) for the optimal ratio of the level of immigration and foreign manpower for both high and low skilled workers.\n[125] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-128)\nThe Government recognises that the current overall foreign workforce should complement the local resident workforce and not replace the Singaporean Core concept, and helps companies greatly as they raise productivity through business restructuring and workforce retraining; raise resident labour force participation rate.\n[126] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-129)\n[127] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-130)\nPoverty and economic inequality\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=20)\n]\nSingapore is one of the world's wealthiest countries\nper capita\n, but its\nGini coefficient (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)\nis high in comparison to developed countries. Statistics on income inequality are published by the Singapore Department of Statistics.\n[128] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-131)\nWithout taking taxes and social transfers into account, Singapore's\ngini coefficient (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)\nputs the country in the medium range. Nevertheless, the country remains on the \"very high\" category on the inequality-adjusted human development index (IHDI), a ranking similar to the\nHuman Development Index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index)\n(HDI), but with\ninequality (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality)\nalso accounted for.\n[129] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-IHDI-132)\nIn October 2018,\nOxfam (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam)\nranked Singapore 149 out of 157 in its Commitment to Reducing Inequality Index 2018, placing it among the bottom ten of the countries in the index, which ranks countries based on efforts to reduce\neconomic inequality (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality)\n.\n[130] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-oxfam_inequality-133)\nIn its report, Oxfam accused Singapore of practices which encouraged \"harmful tax practices\", not having a universal\nminimum wage (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage)\n(apart from\njanitors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janitor)\nand security guards), and poor performance on\nlabour rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_rights)\n.\n[131] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-134)\nThe government responded to the report by claiming that it was more important to look at \"real outcomes\" such as Singapore's high home ownership, health, education, and employment, rather than public spending or tax rates, also saying that the report \"assumes that high taxation and high public expenditure reflects commitment to combating inequality\".\n[130] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-oxfam_inequality-133)\nThe government provides social support through a variety of social assistance schemes. The\nMinistry of Social and Family Development (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Social_and_Family_Development)\nruns ComCare, a program which provides income support for low-income citizen households through various schemes for short-to-medium term assistance, long-term assistance, child support, and urgent financial needs.\n[132] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-135)\nThe\nCommunity Development Councils (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Development_Council)\nalso run various local assistance schemes within their districts.\n[133] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-136)\nThe\nMinistry of Manpower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Manpower_(Singapore))\nruns a Silver Support Scheme which provides additional financial support for low-income elderly with no family support.\n[134] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-137)\nMeanwhile, the\nMinistry of Health (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Singapore))\nalso runs MediFund to assist families that have difficulty paying for medical bills despite government subsidies and\nother health financing schemes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Singapore)\n.\n[135] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-138)\nIn addition, the\nNational Council of Social Service (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Social_Service)\ncoordinates a range of 450 non-government\nvoluntary welfare organisations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_welfare_organisation)\nto provide social services, while raising funds through\nThe Community Chest of Singapore (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Community_Chest_of_Singapore)\n.\n[136] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-139)\nToday, low and middle-income groups now receive 2.5 times the public subsidies they did ten years ago.\n[137] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-140)\nPublic finance\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=21)\n]\nGovernment spending in Singapore has risen since the start of the\n2008 financial crisis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis)\n, from around 15% of GDP in 2008 to 17% in 2012.

The MAS has been given powers to act as a banker to and financial agent of the Government.

Instead, it chooses to do it via the foreign exchange mechanism, which it has been doing since 1981.

It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.\n\nAfter nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.\n\nMost readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year.

Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen have been described among the world's 50 \"superstar cities\".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-7) Surrounding the [Pearl River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta \"Pearl River Delta\") with a total area of 56,000 km 2 (comparable in size to [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia \"Croatia\")), it is the largest and the richest economic region in [South China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China \"South China\").\n\nThe GBA's combined regional [GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product \"Gross domestic product\") was RMB¥13 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) in 2022, which was equivalent to over 10 percent of GDP for all of China. As one of China's most vibrant and important regions, the GBA has the highest concentration of [Fortune 500 companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_Global_500 \"Fortune Global 500\") in the country and houses a majority of China's most innovative technology companies, such as [Huawei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei \"Huawei\"), [ZTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZTE \"ZTE\"), [DJI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJI \"DJI\"), [BYD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company \"BYD Company\"), [GAC Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_Automobile_Industry_Group \"Guangzhou Automobile Industry Group\"), and [Tencent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent \"Tencent\") (parent company of [WeChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat \"WeChat\")). GBA has a rich ecosystem of startups, incubators, and accelerators in the fields of agile tech, biotech, medical tech, and [innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation \"Innovation\"). For these reasons, many experts consider the region an emerging [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley \"Silicon Valley\") of Asia.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-8) Given traditional divisions between the provincial and municipal governments and business elites, there are some opinions that the ambitious idea behind the GBA might be difficult to implement.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-9)\n\nThe \"Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area\" is sometimes confused with the area of the [Pearl River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta \"Pearl River Delta\"), which is a term coined in 1947 referring to a smaller area.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-beltandroad.hktdc.com-10) In the early 2000s, Chinese scholars began using the term “Greater Pearl River Delta” (GPRD) which described the 9 + 2 city agglomeration that encompassed post-handover Hong Kong and Macao, conceptualized as a series of lesser cities as industrial nodes with specialist functions clustering around two prominent cores – Guangzhou and Shenzhen. In 2003, the province advocated the idea of “Pan-PRD” as an even more extensive regional construct that comprised nine neighboring provinces to promote economic cooperation.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-archdaily.com-11) A somewhat similar idea is later mentioned in the English version of China's [13th Five-Year Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_China#Thirteenth_Plan_(2016%E2%80%932020) \"Five-year plans of China\"), taking the Pearl River Delta and including the larger province of Guangdong.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-12) On 1 July 2017, the \"Framework Agreement on Deepening Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Cooperation in the Development of the Bay Area\" (深化粵港澳合作 推進大灣區建設框架協議) was signed in [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong Kong\").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-13)\n\nThe Greater Bay Area has been influenced by its coastal location for centuries. The first known ships from the area are believed to have been constructed by the people of the [Nanyue Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyue \"Nanyue\") (204–112 BCE), who employed them for cultural and economic exchanges with countries as far as present-day Vietnam. After the takeover of the Han Dynasty, trading relations expanded beyond to reach Sri Lanka. During the subsequent period of the [Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms \"Three Kingdoms\"), these trade routes were consolidated. Trade and cultural exchanges grew. Among this, the port of Guangzhou played a major role for the region's trade and cultural exchanges for over two thousand years. Established under the Kingdom of Wu during the period of the Three Kingdoms (222–280 CE), it eventually grew to become the starting point of the ancient maritime silk road during the [Eastern Jin Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Jin_Dynasty \"Eastern Jin Dynasty\") (317–420 CE). By the fourth century CE, communities of foreign merchants began establishing themselves in the city.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-14)\n\nSince the first foreign merchants have established themselves in Guangdong, the whole GBA region's importance for global trade has only increased. When Macao became a Portuguese [colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony \"Colony\") in the mid-1550s, it represented one of the first trading ports in the Far East. It was later joined by Guangzhou, whose port was the only one remaining open for foreign trade during the closure of the country under the [Qing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty \"Qing dynasty\"). The [Opium Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars \"Opium Wars\") brought Hong Kong under British control and forced the opening of other ports in the region. While their respective economic importance was subject to fluctuations later on, the establishment of special economic zones should begin to drive their economic importance anew.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-15)\n\n[Guangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou \"Guangzhou\"), the provincial capital of [Guangdong province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong \"Guangdong\"), attracted the first U.S. investments such as [Coca-Cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola \"Coca-Cola\"), [Procter & Gamble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procter_%26_Gamble \"Procter & Gamble\"), [Pepsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo \"PepsiCo\") in 1990s and to date is the most concentrated area of [U.S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States \"United States\").-financed enterprises which have invested in [southern China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_China \"Southern China\").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-16)\n\nOn 18 February 2019, the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was adopted. The ambitious goal foresees a linkage of the nine cities in Guangdong province's [Pearl River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta \"Pearl River Delta\"), [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong Kong\") and [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau \"Macau\") into an integrated economy and world-class business hub.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-ReferenceB-17) In addition, it is expected to play a key role in [Belt and Road Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative \"Belt and Road Initiative\") by connecting southern China with the countries along the [21st Century Maritime Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Maritime_Silk_Road \"21st Century Maritime Silk Road\").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-18)\n\nThe GBA is located in the southern coastal area of China, consisting of nine cities, or around 30% of the land mass, of the province of Guangdong, plus the [Special Administrative Regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Administrative_Regions \"Special Administrative Regions\") of Hong Kong and Macao.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-ReferenceA-19) Its climate ranges from humid [subtropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics \"Subtropics\") to [tropical climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate \"Tropical climate\") in the far south. There are a few [mountain ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range \"Mountain range\") collectively called the [Nanling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanling \"Nanling\") as well as a few inactive [volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanoes \"Volcanoes\") on [Leizhou Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leizhou_Peninsula \"Leizhou Peninsula\").\n\nMountain ranges and peninsulas shape the GBA. The province of Guangdong, for instance, possesses a coastline of 4,114 km (2,556 mi) due to the multiplicity of islands, bays and peninsulas. This multiplicity of small islands results from the [Pearl River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta \"Pearl River Delta\"), which is the convergent point of the East, North and West Rivers. The network of bays and rivers has contributed to the archipelagic nature of many cities within the GBA. The cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Hong Kong, and Macao for instance \"each possess constituent and distinctly islanded territorial niches that are focused on particular industrial areas.\"[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-20)\n\nThe entire area has temperate springs (March to May), hot and wet summers (June to August), clear and cool autumns (September to November), and mild, rainy winters (December to February). The annual average temperature of Guangdong Province is around 22.3°C (72.1°F), with the average temperature of 16–19°C (61–66°F) in January and 28–29°C (82–84°F) in July. However, the highest temperature in summer goes more than 35°C (95°F) and the lowest can be lower than 10°C (50°F). Temperatures in Hong Kong and Macao are nearly the same, with the annual average temperature around 23°C (73°F), a little higher due to their location more to the south and closer to the equator. GBA receives abundant amount of precipitation throughout the year.\n\nIn 2019, GBA has a total population of approximately 86.17 million people (5% of China's total population).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-Statista-6) The population is expected to reach 100 million people by 2030.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n| Cities | Urban area pop.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-2010PRCcensus-21) | District area pop.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-2010PRCcensus-21) | Administrative area pop.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-2010PRCcensus-21) | Census date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Guangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou \"Guangzhou\") | 10,641,408 | 14,904,400 | 14,904,400 | 2020-11-01 |\n| [Shenzhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen \"Shenzhen\") | 12,356,820 | 12,356,820 | 12,356,820 | 2020-11-01 |\n| [Dongguan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongguan \"Dongguan\") | 8,396,820 | 8,396,820 | 8,396,820 | 2019-11-01 |\n| [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong Kong\") | 7,515,489 | 7,515,489 | 7,515,489 | 2020-06-30 |\n| [Foshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foshan \"Foshan\") | 7,348,581 | 7,348,581 | 9,498,863 | 2020-11-01 |\n| [Zhongshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan \"Zhongshan\") | 2,913,974 | 3,121,275 | 3,121,275 | 2020-11-01 |\n| [Huizhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huizhou \"Huizhou\") | 1,807,858 | 2,344,634 | 4,598,402 | 2010-11-01 |\n| [Jiangmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangmen \"Jiangmen\") | 1,480,023 | 1,822,614 | 4,450,703 | 2010-11-01 |\n| [Zhuhai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai \"Zhuhai\") | 1,369,538 | 1,759,000 | 1,759,000 | 2020-11-01 |\n| [Zhaoqing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhaoqing \"Zhaoqing\") | 784,642 | 1,397,152 | 3,916,467 | 2010-11-01 |\n| [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau \"Macau\") | 652,032 | 652,032 | 652,032 | 2020-08-12[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-22) |\n| Total | 50,850,140 | 56,350,214 | 65,901,668 |  |\n\nThe [Ministry of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(China) \"Ministry of Education (China)\") (MOE) held a press conference on June 2, 2021, to disclose the \"Report on the Language Life Situation in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Greater Bay Area (2021)\".

Times Higher Education lists as the Top 5 of them the [University of Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hong_Kong \"University of Hong Kong\") (ranked place 39 worldwide in 2021), the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong \"Chinese University of Hong Kong\") (ranked 56 worldwide in 2021), the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_University_of_Science_and_Technology \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\") (ranked 56 worldwide in 2021), the [City University of Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_University_of_Hong_Kong \"City University of Hong Kong\") (ranked 126 worldwide in 2021) and the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Polytechnic_University \"Hong Kong Polytechnic University\") (ranked 129 worldwide in 2021).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-42)\n\nThe government seeks to enhance innovation and technology collaboration. Efforts include opening Guangdong's R&D facilities to Hong Kong institutions, supporting participation in national technology programs, and promoting cross-border R&D initiatives. Key infrastructure such as the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, five Hong Kong R&D centres, the Hong Kong Science Park, Cyberport, and State Key Laboratories are involved. The policy also facilitates the exchange of talent, access to funding, and data sharing across regions, while offering immigration and administrative support to promote cross-boundary cooperation in science and technology.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-43)\n\nGBA is rapidly evolving into the dynamic world-class [city cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_cluster \"City cluster\") connected with the modern transportation network featuring [Huangpu Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangpu_Bridge \"Huangpu Bridge\"), [Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong High-speed Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou%E2%80%93Shenzhen%E2%80%93Hong_Kong_Express_Rail_Link \"Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link\"), [Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Zhuhai%E2%80%93Macau_Bridge \"Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge\") (HZM Bridge), [Nansha Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nansha_Bridge \"Nansha Bridge\") and [Guangzhou-Shenzhen Intercity Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou%E2%80%93Shenzhen_intercity_railway \"Guangzhou–Shenzhen intercity railway\").\n\nThere are also massive ongoing [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure \"Infrastructure\") projects underway. Among them – construction of Guangzhou-Zhanjiang High-speed Railway, Gangzhou-Shenzhen Highspeed Railway and Guangzhou-Shanwei-Shantou High-speed Railway.\n\nIn 2024, the completion of several infrastructure projects in the GBA region is set to improve connectivity further. The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge, a key transportation link, is expected to open, dramatically cutting travel time across the Pearl River Delta.\n\nFurther step in GBA's infrastructure development is establishment of airport clusters. Five main airports – [Hong Kong International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_International_Airport \"Hong Kong International Airport\"), [Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_Baiyun_International_Airport \"Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport\"), [Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen_Bao%27an_International_Airport \"Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport\"), [Macau International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau_International_Airport \"Macau International Airport\") and [Zhuhai Jinwan Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai_Jinwan_Airport \"Zhuhai Jinwan Airport\")—as well as a group of feeder airports, will constitute a cluster that will be developed in two phases.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-Limited-44)\n\nPhase one, due for completion in 2025, will establish a Greater Bay Area airport conglomerate, with greater interaction between the facilities. Phase 2 aims to lift all the airports to a world-class level by 2035 with \"safe, green, smart, human and synergetic qualities\".[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-Limited-44)\n\nThe Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL) connects to the national high-speed rail network, significantly shortening the travelling time between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, Guangzhou and other cities in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, and reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a regional transportation hub. in the first six months of 2023, the Hong Kong section of the XRL recorded an average daily patronage of more than 40,000 passenger trips, with the highest number of passenger trips in a single day exceeding 90,000 passenger trips.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-45)\n\n*   [Huangpu Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangpu_Bridge \"Huangpu Bridge\")\n*   [Nansha Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nansha_Bridge \"Nansha Bridge\")\n*   [Humen Pearl River Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humen_Pearl_River_Bridge \"Humen Pearl River Bridge\")\n*   [Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen-Zhongshan_Bridge \"Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge\")\n*   [Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong-Zhuhai-Macau_Bridge \"Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge\")\n\n[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Greater_Bay_Area_Rail_Transit_Network.png/960px-Greater_Bay_Area_Rail_Transit_Network.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Greater_Bay_Area_Rail_Transit_Network.png \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area Rail Transit Network in 2020\")\n\nGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area Rail Transit Network in 2020\n\nUrban rail transit (including metros, commuter and regional railways) is expanding very fast.

INDUSTRIAL POLICIES AND DEVELOPMENT \n\n# PRIORITIES IN THE GREATER BAY AREA \n\n# 4.1 FOREIGN INVESTMENT POLICY \n\nOver recent years, the Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China has increasingly become a focal point for investors. The region has established itself as a center for technological advancement, finance, and trade. For instance, i n 2022, the utilized foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area reached 165.85 billion U.S. dollars. That year, FDI of around 10.63 billion U.S. dollars were utilized in Shenzhen, one of the fastest developing cities in the Greater Bay Area. \n\n## 4.1.1 Foreign investment access conditions and preferential policies \n\n4.1.1.1 Guangdong \n\nIn 2022, the Department of Commerce of Guangdong Province launched the latest edition of Invest Guangdong during the 3rd Qingdao Multinationals Summit (QMS). This guidebook serves as a comprehensive showcase of Guangdong's economic accomplishments and its enhanced business landscape, with a particular focus on key areas such as the Greater Bay Area, cooperation zones like Hengqin and Qianhai, trade, pivotal industries, and the emerging opportunities stemming from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). \n\nGuangdong has proactively reformed its market mechanisms to attract foreign investment, significantly improving market access, intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, government services, and governance based on the rule of law, all under the framework of the Foreign Investment Law of the People's Republic of China. \n\nThis legislation, effective since January 1, 2020, consolidates and replaces three previous laws on foreign investment, providing better protection for the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors while instituting more stringent regulations for the management of foreign-invested projects. \n\nUnder the new law, the process for establishing and modifying foreign-invested enterprises has been streamlined, with companies only needing to register with the Enterprise Registration System overseen by the State Administration for Market Regulation. Moreover, significant reforms have been made to sectoral restrictions and equity limits, such as the opening up of nine sectors for wholly foreign-owned enterprises and the lifting of restrictions on foreign equity limits for Chinese banks and financial asset management companies. \n\nAdditionally, the Foreign Investment Law facilitates increased collaboration between law firms from Hong Kong or Macao and those from mainland China, along with trials of Hong Kong's management model in engineering construction. To incentivize significant foreign investment, various financial incentives have been introduced, including guaranteed returns from provincial finance funds, support for projects by Fortune Global 500 companies and global industry leaders, and one-time awards for foreign-funded multinational corporations contributing significantly to provincial finances. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 20 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\nFurthermore, measures have been implemented to bolster the management of land use, particularly for manufacturing projects with substantial foreign investment and the establishment of headquarters or regional headquarters for major multinational corporations. \n\n4.1.1.2 Macao \n\nMacau has the status of a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), established through a joint declaration between Portugal and the PRC in 1987. \n\nThe region boasts minimal tariffs and restrictions, offering a favorable business climate for foreign investors. The absence of foreign exchange controls on current capital international transactions further facilitates investment activities. Macau operates its own independent public finance system and enjoys a degree of self-governance, although foreign and defense affairs fall under the responsibility of the central PRC government. \n\nEconomically, Macau's reliance on tourism, particularly gaming, and light manufacturing, including textiles and garments, presents profitable opportunities for investors. Notably, the gaming sector dominates inward foreign direct investment (FDI), reflecting its significance in Macau's economy. \n\nDespite its attractiveness to foreign investors, Macau lacks specific foreign investment legislation, and there are generally no restrictions on foreign investment. Both overseas and domestic corporations are subject to the same regulatory framework, primarily governed by the Macau Commercial Code. However, certain sectors, such as education, legal services, and newspapers, have limited foreign control limits. \n\nForeign investors commonly establish their presence in Macau through local branches. This process involves registering with the Macau Commercial and Moveable Properties Registry and fulfilling key requirements, including reserving a name, appointing a representative with permanent residence in Macau, and submitting necessary documentation such as the Incorporation Act of the foreign company and a list of directors. \n\nIn summary, Macau's political stability, favorable business environment, and thriving economic sectors make it an attractive destination for foreign investors seeking opportunities in gaming, tourism, and light manufacturing industries. While the absence of specific foreign investment legislation may raise questions for some investors, the region's overall openness to foreign investment and transparent regulatory framework contribute to its appeal as an investment destination. \n\n4.1.1.3 Hongkong \n\nHong Kong, designated as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China since July 1, 1997, operates under the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" as established in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Recent developments, such as China's imposition of the National Security Law on June 30, have raised concerns about Hong Kong's autonomy. This law has heightened uncertainty for both foreign and local businesses, potentially subjecting them to increased surveillance and arbitrary law enforcement. U.S. citizens in Hong Kong may face heightened scrutiny and the risk of detention for reasons beyond maintaining law and order. \n\nDespite these challenges, Hong Kong maintains a commitment to a free market philosophy with minimal government intervention. The Hong Kong Government (HKG) generally welcomes foreign investment, providing equal opportunities for both foreign controlled and locally controlled //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 21 of 41\n\ncompanies. Foreign firms and individuals can establish operations in Hong Kong without discrimination, facing straightforward reporting requirements and no ownership restrictions. \n\nDespite its relatively small population, Hong Kong remains a significant destination for U.S. investment and trade. It ranks as the fifteenth-largest export market for the U.S., with notable strengths in agricultural products and high-value consumer goods. The city's economy, valued at nearly USD 368 billion in 2019, is primarily driven by competitive financial and professional services, trading, logistics, and tourism sectors. Hong Kong continues to host numerous regional headquarters of multinational companies, including over 1,400 U.S. firms, with finance and related services companies dominating the landscape, including operations of many of the world's largest banks. \n\n## 4.1.2 Industry focus and encouragement direction \n\nComprising nine cities in the Pearl River Delta and two administrative regions, the GBA boasts a population of over 70 million and is a crucial contributor to China's economy.

This convergence towards globalization, connectivity, infrastructure, and innovation underscores the GBA's significance as a focal point for international investment and economic development. \n\n# 4.2 TAXATION AND FINANCIAL POLICIES \n\n## 4.2.1 Tax preferential policies and tax transparency \n\nThe Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has distinctive qualities that bear promise for its development. Upon the basis of “one country, two systems”, the GBA consists of three customs territories and four core cities. As compared to other development areas, it is uniquely positioned geographically and has the unusual advantage of a fused eastern and western heritage. Along with mutual access to its financial markets, a good ecology, a thriving capital market, and generations of multilingual professional talent, the GBA offers favorable conditions for entrepreneurs to succeed in enterprise and wealth creation. The sustainable development of family enterprises in the private economy also encourages stability and growth in the GBA. \n\n4.2.1.1 IIT (Individual Income Tax) \n\nIn an attempt to attract more foreign professionals to work in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), a Notice was jointly issued on March 14, 2019, by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation, granting Individual Income Tax (IIT) subsidies to overseas high-end talent and those in short supply working in the GBA (Circular 31). Following the essence of Circular 31, the Department of Finance of Guangdong Province and the Guangdong Provincial Tax Service under the State Administration of Taxation released a Notice on Implementing the IIT Preferential Policies in the GBA on June 22, 2019. These IIT preferential policies have been in place in Hengqin, the New District of Zhuhai, and the Qianhai District of Shenzhen since 2013. Now, they have expanded to cover nine cities in the GBA, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Zhaoqing. \n\nThe GBA IIT subsidy aims to support overseas high-end and in-demand talent working in the Greater Bay Area. Under this program, the portion of IIT paid by an individual in one of the nine mainland cities of the GBA, exceeding the initial 15 percent of their taxable income, is subsidized by the respective municipal government. This subsidy is also exempt from further IIT. The subsidy is capped at RMB 5 million (approximately US$691,266) per taxpayer in a given tax year (China’s tax year runs from January 1 to December 31). \n\nThe IIT preferential policies implemented in the nine GBA cities effectively balance the tax rate between Hong Kong salaries tax and IIT by providing subsidies to taxpayers. Initially set to expire //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 23 of 41\n\nby the end of 2023, the subsidy is now extended until 2027. Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance issued a notice to the municipal governments of the nine mainland GBA cities, initiating the procedures for the subsidy once again. \n\n• Benefits \n\nEligible persons working in the GBA can obtain financial subsidies from the local governments in the form of IIT rebate. The rebate is calculated as the difference between the actual IIT paid by the applicant and 15 percent of his/her taxable income and it will not be treated as taxable income in the hands of the taxpayers. The tax rate for an ordinary taxpayer is 45%, while the part above the 15% tax rate for the eligible person can be subsidized by the government. In other words, qualified persons can receive IIT subsidies of RMB 300,000 each year. \n\n• Eligibility \n\nThe IIT preferential subsidies for eligible applicants in the GBA are made for overseas high-end talent or talent in short supply who work in specific mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and meet certain criteria set by municipal governments. To qualify, individuals must be permanent residents of Hong Kong or Macao, Hong Kong residents with residency through specific programs, residents of Taiwan, foreign nationals, mainland Chinese returnees, or overseas Chinese with long-term residence abroad. They must also work and pay taxes in one of the nine designated mainland cities, adhere to laws and regulations, and scientific research ethics, and be skilled in scientific and technological innovation, key development industries, or philosophy and social sciences as defined in each city's talent catalog. \n\n4.2.1.2 Consumption tax \n\nConsumption tax applies to both entities and individuals engaged in the production, processing, contract work, or importation of goods subject to consumption tax regulations in China, as well as those selling such goods as specified by the State Council. These entities and individuals are considered consumption taxpayers and are required to remit consumption tax in accordance with the regulations. \n\nTaxable items include cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, cosmetics, fine jewelry, fireworks, refined oil products, luxury watches, yachts, motorcycles, tires, small cars, golf equipment, disposable wooden chopsticks, and wood floor panels. \n\nTax rates for consumption items are determined by the Schedule of Consumption Tax Items and Rates, employing either proportional tax rates ranging from 5% to 35% or specific tax amounts ranging from RMB 0.1 to 250. \n\nThe payable amount of consumption tax is calculated based on volume, value, or a combination of both methods. For volume-based taxation, the tax payable equals the sales value multiplied by the proportional tax rate. For value-based taxation, the tax payable equals the quantity of sales multiplied by the specific tax. For a combination method, the tax payable equals the sales value multiplied by the proportional tax rate plus the quantity of sales multiplied by the specific tax. \n\nTaxes payable on sales of taxable goods are calculated in renminbi. If calculated in a currency other than renminbi, it must be converted. Taxes payable on imported taxable goods are calculated based on the composite taxable value. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 24 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\nExport policies include exemptions and rebates for foreign trade enterprises exporting goods, exemptions without rebates for goods produced by enterprises with export rights, and no exemptions or rebates for goods exported by other commercial enterprises. \n\nEnterprises producing low-emission saloon cars, off-road vehicles, and minibuses receive a 30% reduction in consumption tax payable. \n\nFrom August 1, 2021, value-added tax and consumption tax can be declared together with urban maintenance and construction tax, education surcharges, and local education surcharges. Forms for Value-Added Tax and Surcharges Return and Consumption Tax and Surcharges Return have also been introduced. \n\n4.2.1.3 Stamp tax \n\nThe stamp tax applies to both entities and individuals engaged in the execution of taxable certificates or securities transactions within Mainland China. Additionally, entities or individuals outside Mainland China involved in the execution of taxable certificates utilized within Mainland China are also subject to stamp tax obligations. These taxpayers are required to comply with the regulations outlined in the Stamp Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China. \n\n\"Taxable certificates\" encompass contracts, property rights transfer certificates, and business account books specified in the Table of Taxable Items and Tax Rates attached to the Stamp Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China. \"Securities transactions\" denote the transfer of stocks and stock-based depositary receipts traded on legally recognized stock exchanges and other nationwide securities trading venues approved by the State Council. \n\nCalculation and tax rates are determined according to the Table of Taxable Items and Tax Rates attached to the Stamp Tax Law. Stamp tax payable is computed by multiplying the tax basis by the applicable tax rate. The tax basis includes: \n\n• The contract amount, excluding listed value-added tax, for taxable contracts, \n\n• The amount listed in property rights transfer certificates, excluding listed value-added tax, for taxable property rights transfer certificates, \n\n• The aggregate of paid-up capital (capital stock) plus recorded capital reserves in business account books for taxable business account books, \n\n• The transaction value for securities transactions. \n\nCertain documents are exempt from stamp tax, such as duplicates or transcripts of taxable certificates, certificates concluded by foreign embassies, consulates, or representative offices of international organizations in China for premises acquisition, contracts by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army and the Chinese People’s Armed Police Force, sales contracts for agricultural means of production or agricultural products, and interest-free loan contracts. \n\nMoreover, the State Council has the authority to prescribe stamp tax reduction or exemption in specific cases to address national economic and social development needs, such as meeting housing demands, enterprise restructuring, bankruptcy, and supporting small and micro-//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 25 of 41\n\nenterprise development. These reductions or exemptions must be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress for record-keeping. \n\n## 4.2.2 Talent introduction and training policy \n\nIn January 2024, Hong Kong and Guangdong province signed a framework agreement with the aim of fostering the movement of talent and establishing a coordination mechanism to construct a high-quality talent hub within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. \n\nThe signing event took place in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, and was attended by Chan Kwok-ki, chief secretary for administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, along with Cheng Fubo, a member of the Standing Committee and director of the Organization Department, as well as director of the Talent Work Leading Group Office of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee. \n\nThe agreement's objective is to facilitate the diverse flow of talents within the Greater Bay Area, ushering in new opportunities to attract high-caliber professionals to the region. \n\nHong Kong's efforts in implementing various policy initiatives to attract and retain talent have shown significant outcomes. By late last year, the city had received over 220,000 applications across various talent admission schemes. Of these, more than 130,000 applications were approved, leading to the arrival of approximately 90,000 professionals in Hong Kong. Notably, the Top Talent Pass Scheme, which targets experienced professionals with strong academic backgrounds worldwide, received 65,000 applications, with over 50,000 approvals. \n\nIn Macau, the Special Administrative Region (SAR) has established a Talent Recruitment System focus on boosting innovation, competitiveness, and international recognition. The Macao SAR government intends to leverage the expertise, experience, and networks of top talents to foster the development of key local industries, thereby achieving economic diversification and sustainable growth. This system comprises three distinct programs: the High-end Talents Program, the Outstanding Talents Program, and the Advanced Professionals Program. \n\nTo support the young people attracted by the opportunities proposed in the GBA, Guangdong province has introduced supportive policies aimed at attracting more youths from Hong Kong and Macao to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), according to Hong Kong youths. The policies include mentorship services, work subsidies, and support for entrepreneurs. Mentors with experience on the Chinese mainland will assist young people from Hong Kong and Macao in nine cities of the GBA. Qualified youths will receive a grassroots work subsidy, while subsidies and support will be provided for entrepreneurs setting up businesses in the mainland part of the GBA. These measures are seen as innovative and practical, with the potential to encourage more enterprises to hire young people from Hong Kong and Macao. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, interest among Hong Kong youths to pursue careers in GBA cities is increasing. Suggestions have been made for further policy improvements, such as implementing a credit system to incentivize longer stays in the GBA. Overall, these policies reflect the government's commitment to providing opportunities for Hong Kong and Macao youths and promoting their integration into the mainland's development. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 26 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\n## 4.2.3 Scientific and technological innovation support and scientific \n\n## research cooperation mechanism \n\nThe Guangdong Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin has introduced comprehensive measures to promote technological innovation, spanning six key areas.

It serves strategic goals such as regional coordination, open economic systems, and supporting initiatives like the Belt and Road. \n\nEfforts are underway to strengthen scientific and technological capabilities, with initiatives like the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong and Guangzhou-Zhuhai-Macao innovation corridors and the establishment of major research platforms. Measures to improve the innovation environment involve facilitating cross-border flows of innovation factors, funding scientific research, simplifying import/export procedures, and offering tax incentives to attract talent. The Outline Development Plan, released in 2019, highlights innovation as a key focus. \n\nAnother plan to enhance scientific research cooperation is the Guangdong-Hong Kong Technology Cooperation Funding Scheme (TCFS). Since 2004, it has been promoting advanced technology and technological transfer between Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Shenzhen, aiming to boost productivity and competitiveness in both regions. \n\nSince 2018, Hong Kong institutions can directly apply for science and technology funding at the state level in Shenzhen and Guangdong. Several Hong Kong research institutes have already received funds for R&D projects. Additionally, a memorandum signed in 2017 paved the way for the development of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, a significant innovation hub. The Co-operation Arrangement signed in 2021 further strengthens collaboration between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, facilitating talent and resource exchange and promoting innovation and technology development in the Greater Bay Area. \n\nIn recent years, Hong Kong and mainland China have been implementing measures to facilitate the exchange of personal information within the GBA, leading to increased industrial collaboration //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 27 of 41\n\nin the region. Collaboration between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments strive to align the development of innovation parks, easing the movement of resources between the two cities. \n\nAs Guangdong undergoes industrial transformation, its demand for research and technology input is rising. Hong Kong's industry can utilize Guangdong's advanced manufacturing capacity to support local scientific research while also providing technical solutions and applications to GBA-based businesses. \n\nTo establish itself as a leading international innovation and technology center, Hong Kong's government is encouraging local investment in data facilities, strengthening personnel training, and improving the business environment. Joint initiatives between Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments intend to promote talent, capital, data, and sample exchange, fostering cooperation in the technology industry. \n\nMeanwhile, Guangdong's industry sector has been expanding steadily, with a focus on factory automation, supply chain optimization, and R&D to boost competitiveness. Clusters like Qianhai in Shenzhen and Nansha in Guangzhou offer incentive policies to attract tech companies and talents, driving technological innovation and industrial transformation in the region. \n\nHong Kong companies can leverage these incentives and tap into GBA resources to expand their technology business. By providing expertise in foreign advanced technologies, international standards, and commercialization, Hong Kong can play an active role in driving industrial upgrades in the GBA. Close attention to sector developments is advised to seize business opportunities arising from Guangdong-Hong Kong collaboration. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 28 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\n# 5.

FUTURE OUTLOOK AND SUGGESTIONS \n\n# 7.1 DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS OF THE GREATER BAY AREA \n\n## 7.1.1 Regional integration and economic growth expectations \n\nThe Greater Bay Area (GBA), encompassing Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao, is a crucial driver of economic growth in China, contributing significantly to exports and GDP despite covering just 1% of China's land area. With the full reopening of cross-border activities between Hong Kong and the mainland, the GBA is expected to experience a rebound, with increased demand for cross-border financial services. \n\nIndustries like high-tech manufacturing and the digital economy are flourishing in the GBA, attracting investment interest from both local and overseas enterprises. Hong Kong, positioned as an international financial hub within the GBA, plays a vital role in facilitating cross-border trade and financial services, aided by initiatives like the HSBC Merchant Box for SMEs. \n\nFurthermore, Hong Kong wants to enhance its role as an international innovation and technology hub, leveraging its competitive advantages and collaborating closely with neighboring cities like Shenzhen. Initiatives such as the HSBC GBA Sustainability Fund reflect the region's commitment to sustainable development and green finance. \n\nStrategic partnerships between institutions like HSBC and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) are formed to provide comprehensive support to businesses, including market insights, networking events, and specialized services, to capitalize on the growth opportunities presented by the GBA. \n\nThe Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is a region with significant economic vitality and openness. The National Development and Reform Commission released a \"Three-year Action Plan for the Development of International First-class Business Environment in the GBA\" to enhance its competitiveness globally. The plan intend to establish a world-class business environment within the GBA by aligning policies and mechanisms with international standards. \n\nAccording to the plan, the GBA contributes 11% of China’s GDP, with a GDP exceeding RMB13 trillion in 2022. The plan is a follow-up to the \"Outline Development Plan for the GBA\" released in 2019, emphasizing the importance of constructing a globally competitive business environment. \n\nKey objectives of the action plan include optimizing market access, enhancing government services, improving the legal environment, and fostering openness within the GBA. Specific measures will be taken to relax market access in designated zones like the Hengqin Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone and Guangzhou Nansha. Additionally, the plan aims to assess the effectiveness of market access across GBA cities and study the relaxation of restrictions on Hong Kong and Macao investors. \n\nEfforts will be made to attract foreign investment, establish headquarters of multinational companies, and improve market integration through \"Bay Area Connect Schemes.\" Financial market connectivity will be enhanced by expanding the financial industry opening to Hong Kong and Macao, promoting cooperation between stock exchanges, and implementing Southbound Bond Connect. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 36 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\nFurthermore, the plan proposes exploring cross-border credit reporting cooperation and supporting Hong Kong and Macao financial institutions to operate in the GBA. Overall, the action plan seeks to unleash market vitality, strengthen global resource mobilization, and enhance the GBA's competitiveness in the global business environment. \n\n## 7.1.2 Future development opportunities for Belgian companies \n\nThe 14th Five-Year-Plan of China, spanning from 2021 to 2025, outlines a comprehensive strategy directed toward positioning the nation as a global technology powerhouse. Emphasizing innovation, automation, and the strengthening of China's industrial supply chain, the plan seeks to drive economic growth. Key elements include fostering self-reliance and self-improvement in science and technology to achieve high-income status by leveraging technology across industries. \n\nDespite China's advancements in digital and green infrastructure, there's a continued need for foreign expertise, particularly in areas with technology gaps. This presents opportunities for European tech companies, given the evolving dynamics of international trade. \n\nFIT's (Flanders Investment & Trade) proactive approach involves establishing a Science &Technology Office in Guangzhou's Greater Bay Area. This serves as a strategic hub to facilitate collaboration for Flanders' tech companies across China and attract R&D investment from Chinese partners, focusing on Digital Tech, Climate Tech, and Health Tech. \n\nHealth Tech holds promise for Flemish biotech and biopharma companies, with opportunities for collaboration with China in clinical trial developments. FIT organizes matchmaking events and missions to China to facilitate networking and partnerships between Flemish and Chinese companies. \n\nFIT's extended partnership with the Belgian-Chinese Chamber of Commerce (BCECC) strives to foster long-term collaborative relationships between Belgium and China, promoting trade, investment, and technological exchange. \n\nThe Greater Bay Area initiative links key cities in South China to create an integrated economic zone focused on innovation and technology. With 11% of China's GDP and a population of 86 million, the GBA demonstrates consistent GDP growth across its cities. \n\nHong Kong, Macao, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen play pivotal roles in the GBA. Hong Kong and Shenzhen rank among the top for GDP per capita. The \"Twin Cities, Three Circles\" strategy promotes collaboration and development between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, focusing on economic, technological, and tourism development. \n\nDevelopment plans aim to deepen integration and connectivity within the GBA, fostering economic growth, innovation, and a high quality of life for residents. \n\n# 7.2 PARTICIPATION SUGGESTIONS AND STRATEGIES \n\nEntrepreneurial Dynamics in the Greater Bay Area Entrepreneurs within the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China confront multifaceted challenges as they strive to ensure the sustainable development of family enterprises amidst the region's economic vibrancy. The GBA, comprising Guangdong Province, Hong Kong, and Macau, is a vital economic powerhouse, contributing significantly to China's GDP, with a notable 10.73% share in 2021. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 37 of 41\n\nWithin this dynamic landscape, distinct categories of entrepreneurs have emerged, reflecting the diverse socioeconomic fabric of the region. These include wealth creators, individuals who have amassed substantial fortunes through astute business acumen; highly educated elites, equipped with advanced academic credentials and global perspectives; and next-generation leaders, who inherit and steer family enterprises toward continued success. \n\nThe historical legacy of the GBA as a hub for trade, combined with its favorable business environment, has fostered the rise of influential entrepreneurs commonly referred to as the \"Cantonese Merchants.\" Since China's economic reforms and opening-up policies, the GBA has experienced unprecedented growth, fueled by its strategic geographic location, robust infrastructure, and supportive government initiatives. Consequently, the region has become a magnet for large-scale enterprises, with its cities collectively contributing significantly to China's overall GDP. \n\nHowever, despite the region's economic prowess, entrepreneurs in the GBA encounter a myriad of challenges, particularly in navigating disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these entrepreneurs oversee family businesses characterized by the involvement of multiple generations. Achieving sustainable development in such enterprises necessitates striking a delicate balance between personal aspirations, familial dynamics, and business imperatives. \n\nNevertheless, amidst these challenges, the allure of the GBA for entrepreneurial endeavors remains undeniable. The region continues to offer abundant opportunities for growth, innovation, and collaboration across various sectors, making it an attractive destination for ambitious. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 38 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\n# 8.

It argues that, since this country's independence in the 1960s, its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have both been run in a manner conducive to commercial viability and highly aligned with governmental economic priorities. This ‘commercially viable strategic alignment’, largely absent in SOEs worldwide, has favored cautious privatization and thus the maintenance of a strong SOE sector in Singapore. While recent political backlash from investing abroad has led the government to apparently distance itself from SOEs and Temasek – the SOE-holding-company-turned-investment-fund – their role in developing venture capital and entrepreneurship – both governmental priorities – suggests that a ‘strategic alignment’ remains. Drawing from their substantial financial resources, these entities complement other government efforts in terms of funding, being important players in the Singaporean venture capital markets and have even directly and indirectly invested in Singapore's most successful high-growth companies. In addition, due to their presence in global networks and the complimentary assets they possess, such as access to customers and intellectual property, they provide investees with resources that facilitate their growth and increase their likelihood of succeeding.\nSuggested Citation\nPaiva-Silva, João, 2022.\n\"\nUnderstanding the Singaporean approach to state ownership: ‘commercially viable strategic alignment’ in historical perspective (https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/streco/v61y2022icp43-58.html)\n,\"\nStructural Change and Economic Dynamics (https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/streco.html)\n, Elsevier, vol. 61(C), pages 43-58.\nHandle:\nRePEc:eee:streco:v:61:y:2022:i:c:p:43-58\nDOI: 10.1016/j.strueco.2021.10.014\nas\nHTML\nHTML with abstract\nplain text\nplain text with abstract\nBibTeX\nRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)\nReDIF\nJSON\nDownload full text from publisher\nFile URL:\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954349X21001454\nDownload Restriction:\nFull text for ScienceDirect subscribers only\nFile URL:\nhttps://libkey.io/10.1016/j.strueco.2021.10.014?utm_source=ideas\nLibKey link\n: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n--->\n<---\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to\nsearch\nfor a different version of it.\nReferences listed on IDEAS\nas\nHTML\nHTML with abstract\nplain text\nplain text with abstract\nBibTeX\nRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)\nReDIF\nJSON\nHuff,W.

Most existing studies on the convergence and competition of the manufacturing structure in the Greater Bay Area lack a comprehensive measurement and analysis from the perspective of the metropolitan circle by using multiple indicators in multiple dimensions, especially the intra-city division of labor.\nThis paper addresses the gap by examining the structural convergence, industrial competition, and cooperation networks, specialization, and labor division in the manufacturing sector of mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area for the years 2011, 2016, and 2021. The findings are as follows. 1) There are varying degrees of convergence among mainland cities, with the Guangzhou and Shenzhen metropolitan circles showing significant convergence. This is primarily driven by intra-industry labor division and industrial chain cooperation between core and cooperative cities within these metropolitan circles. 2) Industrial competition in the Greater Bay Area manifests as horizontal competition between cities of similar economic levels, both within and across city circles. Conversely, industrial cooperation appears as a vertical collaboration between core and cooperative cities, predominantly within metropolitan areas. Horizontal competition has diminished while vertical cooperation has strengthened. 3) The convergence and cooperation within the Greater Bay Area are significantly influenced by the strengthening of metropolitan circle connections, the radiating and driving roles of core cities, geographical proximity, and the positive impact of Hong Kong and Macao.\nThis paper extends existing literature in three aspects. 1) Utilizing multiple indicators, the paper offers a thorough investigation into the convergence and evolution of manufacturing structures in mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area, thus enriching research on industrial structure convergence. 2) This paper distinguishes the structural similarity and changes among the three metropolitan circles within the Greater Bay Area, focusing on core and collaborative cities as well as cities of similar economic levels. 3) It not only compares the industrial structure horizontally across the Greater Bay Area but also evaluates the vertical industrial division among mainland cities using multi-regional input-output tables from relevant years.\nThe conclusions provide valuable insights and empirical evidence for shaping industrial development policies and regional integration strategies in the Greater Bay Area, highlighting the dynamic interplay between competition and cooperation in fostering regional economic growth.\nKey words\nGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (javascript:;)\n/\nindustrial competition and collaboration (javascript:;)\n/\nmetropolitan circle (javascript:;)\n/\nindustrial structure convergence (javascript:;)\n[No Text] (javascript:;)\nCite this article\nEndNote (https://jnxb.jnu.edu.cn/skb/CN/article/getTxtFile.do?fileType=EndNote&id=7031)\nRis (Procite) (https://jnxb.jnu.edu.cn/skb/CN/article/getTxtFile.do?fileType=Ris&id=7031)\nBibtex (https://jnxb.jnu.edu.cn/skb/CN/article/getTxtFile.do?fileType=BibTeX&id=7031)\nDownload Citations\nYANG Yaping, QIN Ning.\nHas the Industrial Structure in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Became Increasingly Homogeneous: From the Perspective of Convergence and Competition in the Industrial Structure of Manufacturing Industries.\nJinan Journal\n. 2024, 46(7): 146-164 https://doi.org/10.11778/j.jnxb.20231414\nPrevious Article\nNext Article\nPDF(1464 KB)\n276\nAccesses\n0\nCitation\nAltmetric\nDetail (javascript:;)\nSections\nRecommended\nAbstract (https://jnxb.jnu.edu.cn/skb/EN/10.11778/j.jnxb.20231414#0)\nKey words (https://jnxb.jnu.edu.cn/skb/EN/10.11778/j.jnxb.20231414#1)\nCite this article (https://jnxb.jnu.edu.cn/skb/EN/10.11778/j.jnxb.20231414#2)\nContact us\nAddress: Jinan University No.601 Huangpu Dadao West,Guangzhou,China\nPostal Code: 510632\nOffice Phone: 020-85224092\nLiberal Arts Phone: 020-85220281\nVisited\nTotal visitors:\n190579\nVisitors of today:\n1997\nNow online:\n16\nCopyright © Jinan Journal, All Rights Reserved.\n粤ICP备12087612号 (https://beian.miit.gov.cn)\n/\n〈\n〉",

By 1985 it had become a modern metropolis with more than 80% of its residents living in public housing.   This globally unparalleled transformation was achieved through compulsory, often controversial, land acquisition and resettlement. The policy remains central to Singapore's urban planning and development.   The Land Acquisition Act (LAA) was passed in 1966, the year after Singapore became independent. It gave the government sweeping powers to acquire vast amounts of private land at below-market rates. Spaces for public housing, industrial parks and infrastructure were obtained quickly as the state's decisions could not be challenged in court.   Early acquisitions were primarily for public housing built by the Housing Development Board (HDB). They went hand in hand with resettlement, which was largely accomplished without serious public backlash.   The policy dovetailed with founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on home ownership for building a stakeholder society. He encouraged this by allowing Singaporeans to use their Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to make down payments, and the HDB offered subsidised mortages.\nDownload PDF [PDF, 8.1 MB] (https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/50/aac3af3c-1e66-411c-93eb-41c12cd6730f/uss-land-acquisition-and-resettlement.pdf)\nBack to\nPublications library (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/)\nOther pages in\nPublications library\n“Urbanisation is Not An Accident” (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/urbanisation-is-not-an-accident/)\n10 Principles for Liveable High Density Cities Lessons from Singapore (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/10-principles-for-liveable-high-density-cities-lessons-from-singapore/)\n13th Asia Smart City Conference ASCC in Yokohama, Japan, 22-24 Oct 2024 (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/13th-asia-smart-city-conference--yokohama--japan--22-24-oct-2024/)\n50 Years of Urban Planning in Singapore (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/50-years-of-urban-planning-in-singapore/)\n200 Years of Singapore and the United Kingdom (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/200-years-of-singapore-and-the-united-kingdom/)\nA Better World: Sustainable Cities and Communities (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/a-better-world-sustainable-cities-and-communities/)\nA Chance of a Lifetime: Lee Kuan Yew and the Physical Transformation of Singapore (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/a-chance-of-a-lifetime-lee-kuan-yew-and-the-physical-transformation-of-singapore/)\nA City in Blue and Green - The Singapore Story (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/a-city-in-blue-and-green-the-singapore-story/)\nA City of Culture: Planning for the Arts (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/a-city-of-culture-planning-for-the-arts/)\nA City-to-City Exchange (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/a-city-to-city-exchange/)\nSee all pages (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/)\nBack to top (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/land-acquisition-and-resettlement-securing-resources-for-development)\nCentre for Liveable Cities Knowledge Hub\nPublications (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications/)\nReach us\n[No Text] (https://sg.linkedin.com/company/clcsg)\n[No Text] (https://www.facebook.com/CLCsg/)\n[No Text] (https://www.youtube.com/@CentreforLiveableCities)\nContact (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/contact-us/)\nFeedback (https://www.form.gov.sg)\n©\n2025\nGovernment of Singapore\n, last updated\n15 August 2025\nReport Vulnerability (https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability)\nPrivacy Statement (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/privacy-statement/)\nTerms of Use (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/terms-of-use/)\nREACH (https://www.reach.gov.sg)\nMade withIsomer (https://www.isomer.gov.sg)\nBuilt byOpen Government Products (https://www.open.gov.sg)\nCentre for Liveable Cities Knowledge Hub\nPublications (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications/)\nReach us\n[No Text] (https://sg.linkedin.com/company/clcsg)\n[No Text] (https://www.facebook.com/CLCsg/)\n[No Text] (https://www.youtube.com/@CentreforLiveableCities)\nContact (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/contact-us/)\nFeedback (https://www.form.gov.sg)\n©\n2025\nGovernment of Singapore\n, last updated\n15 August 2025\nReport Vulnerability (https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability)\nPrivacy Statement (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/privacy-statement/)\nTerms of Use (https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/terms-of-use/)\nREACH (https://www.reach.gov.sg)\nMade withIsomer (https://www.isomer.gov.sg)\nBuilt byOpen Government Products (https://www.open.gov.sg)",

(https://research.hktdc.com/en/regulatory-alerts/asia/doing-business)\nSingapore: New Work Visa Rules Introduced to Attract Foreign Talent\n15 Sept 2022\nHKTDC Research\nSingapore has introduced new work visa rules to attract skilled foreign talent. According to the new rules, announced on 29 August 2022, foreigners earning at least SGD30,000 (US$21,450) monthly will be eligible for a five‑year visa under the Overseas Networks and Expertise (ONE) pass, available from January 2023.\nThe ONE pass will give holders the flexibility to simultaneously start, operate and work for several firms in Singapore. The pass will also allow their dependents to search for jobs after obtaining a letter of consent. Foreign talent that falls short of the salary threshold, but has outstanding achievements in the arts and culture, science and technology, research and academia, or sports fields, may still be eligible.\nTechnology professionals will also be eligible to apply for the five‑year visa from September 2023. Currently, visas for such professionals are only valid for two or three years. To monitor performance, ONE pass holders must report their professional activities annually. Singapore has also reduced the processing time for employment passes, cutting the current three weeks maximum processing time to 10 days.\nRelated Topics\nSingapore (https://research.hktdc.com/en/tag/?type=regionValue&key=%7C3%3B178%7C)\nASEAN (https://research.hktdc.com/en/tag/?type=regionValue&key=%7C4%3B17%7C)\nSoutheast Asia (https://research.hktdc.com/en/tag/?type=regionValue&key=%7C4%3B13%7C)\nVISA (https://research.hktdc.com/en/tag/?type=EN%21keywordValue&key=%7CVISA%7C)\nPROFESSIONALS (https://research.hktdc.com/en/tag/?type=EN%21keywordValue&key=%7CPROFESSIONALS%7C)\nOVERSEAS NETWORKS AND EXPERTISE PASS (https://research.hktdc.com/en/tag/?type=EN%21keywordValue&key=%7COVERSEAS%23NETWORKS%23AND%23EXPERTISE%23PASS%7C)\nIn focus: Philippines (2023 data) (https://research.hktdc.com/en/data-and-profiles/market-profiles/philippines)\nPopulation: 117.3 mn\nGDP: US$437.1 bn\nGDP per capita: US$3,906\nTrade with HK: 5\nth\nlargest import market in ASEAN\nDetail (https://research.hktdc.com/en/article/MzIwNjk4NzY3)\nRelated Articles\nVIETNAM: Da Nang Designated as First Free Trade Zone (https://research.hktdc.com/en/article/MjA4OTI1MzA3Mw)\nTHAILAND: Extended Ban Introduced on Electronic Waste Imports (https://research.hktdc.com/en/article/MjA4NzY3MDM4Ng)\nMALAYSIA: Trade Deal Signed with European Free Trade Association (https://research.hktdc.com/en/article/MjA4NjAxOTA2OA)\nLaos: Market Profile (https://research.hktdc.com/en/article/MzU3OTkwOTUx)\nCambodia: Market Profile (https://research.hktdc.com/en/article/MzIwNzAzMDA1)\nRecent Articles in Regulatory Alert -

In recent years, the geographic and functional structures of industries are constantly changing due to global industrialization and regional urbanization. Thus far, a scarcity of research has investigated spatial-functional organizations of sectoral industries in urbanized megaregions. By using points of interest (POIs) data collected in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), this paper seeks to portray the spatial extent of industrial agglomerations and to label their functional characteristics. A kernel density function is first applied to measure the spatial extent of industrial agglomerations. Next, we explore the industrial functions by implementing a semantic-based information retrieval to label the functional characteristics of industrial agglomerations via words that are tokenized from POI registered names. The empirical results suggest that the concentrations of industrial activities are strongly heterogeneous across different economic sectors, revealing that agglomerations across the GBA can provide a variety types of industrial products and services. Concerning manufacturing industries, the present analysis further confirms the existence of both specialization and diversification agglomerations along with far distinct spatial characteristics. This research supplements empirical evidence and provides novel insights into the geographical and functional organizations of economic activities regarding one of the largest urban megaregions in the world. The implications that are related to megaregional economic collaboration and development are discussed.\nOriginal language\nEnglish\nPages (from-to)\n1995-2010\nNumber of pages\n16\nJournal\nEnvironment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science (https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/publications/spatial-and-functional-organizations-of-industrial-agglomerations)\nVolume\n49\nIssue number\n7\nDOIs\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/23998083221075641 (https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083221075641)\nPublication status\nPublished -\nSept 2022\nKeywords\nagglomeration economies\nfunctional characteristics\nGeographic agglomeration\nmegaregion\nsectoral industries\nASJC Scopus subject areas\nArchitecture\nGeography, Planning and Development\nUrban Studies\nNature and Landscape Conservation\nManagement, Monitoring, Policy and Law\nUN SDGs\nThis output contributes to the following UN\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/)\nMore information\n10.1177/23998083221075641 (https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083221075641)\nOther files and links\nLink to publication in Scopus (http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?scp=85127708250&partnerID=8YFLogxK)\nFingerprint\nDive into the research topics of 'Spatial and functional organizations of industrial agglomerations in China’s Greater Bay Area'.

global recruitment agency Phaidon International, gives his view on the latest policy changes announced on 29 August 2022 (including the new Overseas Networks & Expertise pass), and what opportunities they bring in a post-pandemic world.\nBy Andrew McNeilis | 15 Sep 2022\nSingapore recently announced a slew of policy changes aimed at attracting top foreign talent. This includes the\nintroduction of the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass (https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2022-08-29%2Fsingapore-unveils-long-term-work-visas-to-end-talent-crunch&data=05%7C01%7CKatrina.Chui%40phaidoninternational.com%7Cf3f0e9e8eb284861d71308da8fba8b2c%7C4a1612ce20fc43f18c2771a95167b458%7C0%7C0%7C637980328604220293%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Jtks3%2BFOoB23cv8B8lIOG0KDX0qAEyJ1%2B6E%2BGcbD%2Fjg%3D&reserved=0)\n, a five-year visa for top talent. This supplements its existing passes, including the\nEntrePass and the Tech Pass (https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/passes/)\n.\nHere’s breaking down what this means for talent looking to move to Singapore and businesses looking to attract top talent.\nThe benefits of the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass\n1. Five years of stability\nSingapore is seen as the gateway to Asia Pacific and the respective economies within the region. Therefore the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass, once it kicks in on 1 January 2023, will be very appealing to firms seeking to attract top talent.\nThe pass allows for five years of stability, meaning professionals considering the move to Singapore who have family will have a timeframe of certainty to plan their relocation within. Should they decide to renew their pass, there is also a possibility of extending it by another five years, subject to eligibility criteria. In addition, spouses will be able to obtain a Letter of Consent (LOC), which permits them to work in Singapore.\n2. A fast turnaround time\nThere is also the fact that the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass approval is meant to be very quick – within 4 weeks. There is no need for\nComplementarity Assessment COMPASS Framework (http://mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/employment-pass/upcoming-changes-to-employment-pass-eligibility/complementarity-assessment-framework-compass)\nnor the\nFair Consideration Framework (https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/fair-consideration-framework)\njob advertising requirements, meaning a speedy turnaround. This is hugely beneficial to companies as they can get ahead in such a competitive talent market.\n3. Progression talent within Singapore\nThe Overseas Networks & Expertise pass enables talent to move technically under their own means to employers. For those businesses, they will need to be hot on ensuring they offer senior, high performing talent a great employment experience because of the autonomy the pass brings professionals. The reality is that the best talent has lots of options and the five-year timeframe of the pass, plus the ability to renew, means that businesses can secure talent long term, paving the way for career progression also within Singapore.\nOther policies change to secure talent\nBesides the latest initiative of the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass, Singapore has also been applying significant policy changes that eases international talent movements into Singapore.\nSingapore’s approach to hiring international talent and the corresponding visa policies in place have been incredibly dynamic in the true sense of the word. During Covid-19, the focus was on safe measures and job security for Singaporeans, and the reality was that during the pandemic hiring international talent was not an option.\nPost-Covid-19 there has been an evolution. There is clearly a desire and acceptance that Singapore requires skills that are not yet present in the country, but for many businesses hiring locally is the first port of call. It makes commercial and practical sense, from a speed point of view but also for easier access and certainty.\n1. Reducing Employment Pass processing time\nFor one, the processing time for Employment Pass has been reduced drastically to 10 business days. This short turnaround – approval or otherwise – is a huge help to businesses and should be applauded.\n2. Increasing Employment Pass duration for tech professionals with skills in shortage\nSecondly, the duration of Employment Pass for tech talent with in-demand skills, has been extended from the usual 2 years to 5 years. This refers to experienced professionals in tech occupations on the COMPASS shortage Occupation List – to be announced in the coming months – earning a fixed monthly salary of $10,500.\nThis is also a boon to companies looking to secure top talent for longer periods, and also offers more stability to talent relocating to Singapore, and things should be clearer when the shortage Occupation List is released in the coming months.\nSuch policies have accelerated the ability to hire the right international talent swiftly. Delays can be incredibly detrimental to the hiring process, as both businesses and professionals want to be in an environment with maximum certainty and control.\nBusiness-critical talent are exposed to global opportunities and as a talent partner we must remind ourselves and the companies we represent that Singapore is competing for these professionals on a global basis. Amplifying speed and certainty is a crucial action.\nAdvice on looking for career opportunities in Singapore\nSingapore is a wonderful place to live and work, and whenever relocating is always important to research and ask for guidance.\n1. Familiarise yourself with local labour laws\nFirstly, familiarise yourself with the labour laws and how – as international talent – you might secure entry. Have enough awareness and knowledge to know if your specific skillset and experience is in demand and worthy of a visa. A useful resource to reference is the\nwork pass comparison table (https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/passes/)\nthat the Singapore Global Network has put together.\nYou will position yourself well with any firm looking to hire internationally by being able to articulate clearly what skills and capabilities you bring. For this reason it is vital your CV and job search reflects this.\n2. Research all benefits\nSecondly, beyond employment, you should do your research – be smart and work out whether this is culturally where you, or importantly you and/ or your family, want to thrive in. Again, do your homework – research housing, schools, and health. Talk to specialist talent partners, look at government websites, and ask your own network for insights. For more tips on how you may go about doing this,\nI’ve put together some tips here (https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/stories/business/from-army-captain-to-recruitment-md-andrew-mcneilis-shares-expert-job-search-tips/)\n.\nFor example, at\nPhaidon International (https://hubs.ly/Q01lQ7p90)\n, we have produced a\nRelocation Guide (https://hub.selbyjennings.sg/hubfs/Selby%20Jennings%20APAC/Selby%20Jennings_Singapore%20relocation%20guide.pdf)\nand our consultants work in specific niches so they can not only advise you on roles, salary and benefits, but also connect you with those who made the transition successfully. In addition, the Singapore Global Network also offers\na series of guides (https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/guides/#workinsgguide)\nthat gives you insights into what life in Singapore could be like for you and your family.\nHow to attract business-critical talent to Singapore\nAll these new talent policies will only help Singapore secure the very best talent. Low tax, family friendly culture, excellent healthcare, and a safe law-abiding society with excellent legal recourse for business are hugely attractive features that benefit businesses and international talent alike looking to move to Singapore.\nThere is, however, a universal truth that for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction. Here are some of the challenges as a leading talent partner that we have found that could hold back attracting talent to Singapore.\n1. Rental Prices\nThe influx of talent from Shanghai and Hong Kong coming into Singapore has been well documented. This has, alongside construction delays due to Covid-19, impacted the price of accommodation.\nShort-term, there is no doubt that access and the price of rent has become a headline, and a key consideration for the best professionals with lots of international choices. If the cost of daily life eats up the low taxation benefits, this could present some challenges. As we move into 2023 perhaps rental price hikes will calm, but if not is something that candidates will need to consider as they make the move.\nRegarding availability of spaces at international schools, demand remains high at brand-name schools with Singapore’s growing popularity among global talent. However, it is worth noting that there are plenty of options available outside these top favourite international schools. For a list of schools and more details on their curriculum, refer to\nthis article (https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/stories/culture/an-introduction-to-international-schools-in-singapore/)\nby Expat Living.\n2. “Dual career” families\nThe vast majority of families have two parents who work, and previously the\nLetter of Consent (https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/loc-for-ica-issued-ltvp-holders/eligibility)\n(LOC) was very helpful because it entitled a spouse to work in Singapore. Without this, great talent could potentially be put off because they have no guarantee of envisioning moving their family to Singapore with them. For a start, holders of the new\nOverseas Networks & Expertise Pass (https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/passes/)\nare entitled to obtaining a LOC for spouses, and we are hopeful that future policies may reintroduce the LOC, possibly with heightened parameters.\nLooking ahead to the job market in South-East Asia\nTech continues to be a highly competitive environment across South-east Asia. The Financial Services sector continues to have strong demand for key tech and transformation skills, whereas some of the retail /e-commerce players have had less demand with occasional lay-offs.\nEmployers should be wary that a shortage of talent leads to some challenges. For example, when an employee resigns we are seeing astronomical levels of counter offers from their incumbent employer, with salaries, benefits and titles being thrown around to prevent a professional from leaving. The speed with which hiring firms are acting also reflects the talent shortage, but presents great opportunities for candidates seeking opportunities in Singapore.\nRegionally, we are seeing tech talent moving from hubs such as Vietnam, Hong Kong and mainland China. Importantly such talent is agnostic towards particular industry sectors – in simple terms great tech talent can move from Life Sciences to Supply Chain with ease due to their highly transferable set of technical skills.\nAbout Phaidon International\nPhaidon International (https://hubs.ly/Q01lQ7p90)\nis the talent partner of choice for clients and highly skilled professionals, securing business-critical talent worldwide across six specialist brands where a relentless supply demand imbalance exists:\nSelby Jennings (https://hubs.la/Q01lQ8480)\n– Financial Sciences & Services\nLVI Associates (https://hubs.la/Q01lQ88V0)\n– Engineering & Infrastructure\nDSJ Global (https://hubs.la/Q01lQ8610)\n– Supply Chain\nEPM Scientific (https://hubs.la/Q01lQ85j0)\n– Life Sciences\nGlocomms (https://hubs.la/Q01lQ8dL0)\n– Technology\nLarson Maddox (https://hubs.la/Q01lQ8gk0)\n– Regulatory & Legal\nWant to learn more about Singapore's work passes?\nLearn more (https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/passes)\nAbout Andrew McNeilis\nAndrew has over 30 years’ commercial experience working in strategic leadership roles across organizations ranging from start-ups to public companies throughout Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and the Americas.

Singapore’s trading history began in 1819 when the British East India Company established it as a trading settlement from which the British could extend their political and economic influence into East Asia. This historical positioning of Singapore as a place of trade, as well as a strong economy and intelligent work force, served as incentives for MNCs to invest and even base themselves in the internationalized country. Singapore encouraged MNC development with hopes that investments from developed countries would introduce modern technology and the quality of life that inherently follows from technological advancement. MNCs flocked to Singapore because telecommunications allowed them to hold coordinated offices across the globe. Companies were also better able to manage the Asian market from within; they had better market access and did not have to contend with import regulations. Despite the relationship appearing mutually satisfactory on the surface, Singapore experiences negative effects of MNC dominance, including MNC control of technology and MNC constraint on growth and development. Although the relationship between Singapore and MNCs is uneven, one can conclude that entities enter into, and remain in, relationships in order to gain political and economic advantages.\n\n**Keywords**: Singapore, multinational corporations, trade, investment, growth, development, technology, relationship, market, economy\n\n[Click here for full article](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/files/2019/11/Spring-1993-Angell.pdf)\n\n[Return to issue](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/journal-issues/issues-between-1990-1999/spring-1993/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/journal-issues/issues-between-1990-1999/spring-1993/eastern-europe-and-the-ec/) / [Next Issue](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/journal-issues/issues-between-1990-1999/fall-1993/)\n\n#### Search\n\nSearch for: \n\n#### Welcome!\n\n**Welcome to the Towson University Journal of International Affairs.**\n\n**Established in 1967, we are the oldest undergraduate-run journal of international affairs.**\n\n#### Speaker Series\n\n[![Image 4: Speaker Series](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/files/2024/09/Belgrad-Speaker-Flyer-1-544x263.png)](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/presenting-the-fall-2024-belgrad-speaker-event/)\n\n#### Recent Blog Posts\n\n*   [(no title)](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/2024/11/04/15615/)November 4, 2024\n*   [Grasping at Laws: Climate Litigation in International Courts a Step Toward Justice for Small Island Developing States?](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/2023/12/18/grasping-at-laws-climate-litigation-in-international-courts-a-step-toward-justice-for-small-island-developing-states/)December 18, 2023\n*   [The Freedom and Oppression of France’s Laïcité](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/2023/11/13/the-freedom-and-oppression-of-frances-laicite/)November 13, 2023\n*   [In the Wake of Wagner: The Dangers of Mercenary Groups](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/2023/11/11/in-the-wake-of-wagner-the-dangers-of-mercenary-groups/)November 11, 2023\n*   [BRICS Expansion: A Sign of Strength or Weakness?](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/2023/11/07/brics-expansion-a-sign-of-strength-or-weakness/)November 7, 2023\n\n#### Subscribe by Email\n\nCompletely spam free, opt out any time.\n\nPlease, insert a valid email.\n\nThank you, your email will be added to the mailing list once you click on the link in the confirmation email.\n\nYour Email Leave this field blank \n\nSpam protection has stopped this request.

  "https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/about/hongkong.html": "Title: Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area\n\nURL Source: https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/about/hongkong.html\n\nPublished Time: Fri, 15 Aug 2025 07:04:43 GMT\n\nMarkdown Content:\nMajor Social and Economic Indicators (2024)\n-------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 1](https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/filemanager/template/common/images/cities/city-HongKong.jpg)\n\n| Area | 1 115km 2 |\n| --- |\n| Population | Around 7.5 million |\n| Gross domestic product (GDP) | Around HK$3,200 billion |\n| GDP per capita | Around HK$420,000 |\n| Value of total merchandise trade | Around HK$9,500 billion |\n| Value of export | Around HK$4,500 billion |\n| Value of import | Around HK$5,000 billion |\n| Industrial structure (% of GDP)* | Primary industry (agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery): 0.1% of GDP Secondary Industry (industrial and construction): Around 7% of GDP Tertiary industry (service industry): Around 94% of GDP |\n| Port Cargo Throughput | Around 180 million tons |\n| Passenger Throughput | Visitor Arrivals to Hong Kong: Around 45 million passenger trips Hong Kong International Airport: Around 53 million passenger trips |\n\nNote: the above figures are provided by relevant department of the Hong Kong SAR Government\n\n* 2023 data\n\n*   Located on the southern coast of the country and heart of Asia, Hong Kong enjoys fortuitous geographic advantage and is a world city leveraging on the Mainland while engaging the world. Hong Kong is well connected to Asia's key markets, making it an ideal location for businesses to tap into the multitude of opportunities in the Mainland and Asia-Pacific region.\n\n### Impressive international reputations\n\n*   Hong Kong was ranked by Canada's Fraser Institute first globally in its Economic Freedom of the World: 2024 Annual Report.\n*   Hong Kong ranked third in the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) 37 Report published by the Z/Yen from the United Kingdom and the China Development Institute from Shenzhen.\n*   Hong Kong was recognised by the International Institute for Management Development World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025 as the third most competitive economies in the world.\n*   According to the World Trade Organization, Hong Kong ranked the seventh largest trading entity in the world in 2024.\n\n### Hong Kong's unique advantages in the Greater Bay Area\n\n*   Being the most international city in the Greater Bay Area, Hong Kong has a business-friendly environment, good tradition of the rule of law, free economic system, and well-established information technology infrastructure and financial system, as well as a wealth of high-end talents and professional services with extensive knowledge on global markets.\n*   The Outline of the 14 th Five-Year Plan for the National Economic and Social Development of the People's Republic of China (the 14 th Five-Year Plan) positions Hong Kong as the centres in eight important areas, including “four traditional centres” (namely international financial, transportation and trade centres as well as [centre for international legal and dispute resolution services](https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/opportunities/legal.html) in the Asia-Pacific region), and “four emerging centres” (namely an international aviation hub, an international innovation and technology centre, a regional intellectual property trading hub and an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange). Moreover, the 14 th Five-Year Plan supports Hong Kong in better integrating into the overall development of the country, emphasising the support for building a high-quality Greater Bay Area.\n\n### Transportation and logistics hub\n\n*   With a sound transport system and world-class infrastructure, Hong Kong is an international and regional transportation and logistics hub and is committed to developing into a cruise hub in the region.\n*   In the area of air transport services, Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is one of the world's busiest airports in terms of international passenger and cargo throughput. It has been frequently ranked one of the world's best airports. Hong Kong is within a four-hour flight from Asia's key markets and a five-hour flight from half the world's population. In the area of maritime services, Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world in terms of container throughput. Benefiting from Victoria Harbour's deep waters, no air draft limit and well-equipped cruise berthing facilities, the Kai Tai Cruise Terminal serves the world's largest cruise liners.\n*   Being well-versed in operation and regulations of international trade and possessing talents and international network, Hong Kong has been thriving in high value-added professional maritime services. On aviation, HKIA is a mature international and regional aviation hub with a well-established network of international air routes. Leveraging the advantage of an international maritime centre, Hong Kong will drive other Greater Bay Area cities to build a world-class harbour and airport cluster as well as a cluster for high-end maritime service industries in the Asia-Pacific region for the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n### Cross-boundary infrastructure\n\nThe commissioning of three significant transport infrastructure projects, namely the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB), the Hong Kong Section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL) and Liantang/Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point (LT/HYW BCP) will substantially reduce travelling time between Hong Kong and other Greater Bay Area cities, and vastly improve the transport connectivity within the Greater Bay Area, thereby creating a highly accessible Greater Bay Area as well as connecting the Greater Bay Area to the world. This will consolidate Hong Kong's status as international financial, transportation and trade centres as well as an international aviation hub.\n\n*   HZMB \n    *   The HZMB will significantly reduce transportation costs and time for travellers and goods. For example, the travelling time between the Kwai Tsing Container Terminal and Zhuhai will be reduced from currently three and a half hours or so to about 75 minutes, whilst the travelling time between the Hong Kong International Airport and Zhuhai will be reduced from currently four hours or so to about 45 minutes.\n    *   The Western Pearl River Delta (PRD) will fall within a reachable three-hour commuting radius of Hong Kong, enhancing the city's position as a trade and logistics hub as goods from the Western PRD, Western Guangdong and Guangxi can better make use of the airport and container ports in Hong Kong. The HZMB will accelerate the economic integration of the PRD and its neighbouring provinces.\n\n*   Hong Kong Section of the XRL \n    *   Scheduled to be commissioned in September 2018, the Hong Kong Section of the XRL will connect Hong Kong with the over 47 000-km National High Speed Rail Network.\n    *   The travelling time from the West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong to Shenzhen, Guangzhou as well as other cities in the PRD region will be greatly shortened, taking only about 14 minutes to Futian, 18 minutes to Shenzhen North and 47 minutes to Guangzhou South. Passengers can also reach other Greater Bay Area cities through onward transfer to the PRD Intercity Rapid Transit.\n\n*   LT/HYW BCP \n    *   The LT/HYW BCP will be the first road-based BCP in Hong Kong with direct access facilities for both passengers and vehicles. It connects with the Eastern Corridor to Longgang in Shenzhen and further extends to the eastern part of Guangdong Province via the Shenzhen-Huizhou Expressway (also known as Huizhou-Yantian Expressway) or Shenzhen-Shantou Expressway, providing a direct and efficient cross-boundary access to eastern Shenzhen, Huizhou, eastern Guangdong as well as the neighbouring provinces.\n\n### Economic and Trade Relations between Hong Kong and the Mainland\n\n*   Hong Kong has long been leveraging its unique advantages to enhance its role and functions in the process of the country's economic development and opening up of its economy. It continues to serve as a gateway for multinational companies accessing the Mainland market and as an important platform for Mainland companies seeking to expand overseas.\n*   In terms of trade, Hong Kong and the Mainland are each other's major trading partners. Since the reform and opening up of the country, the Mainland's share of Hong Kong's global trade had increased significantly from 9.3% in 1978 to 51.0% (HK$4,826.3 billion) in 2024.\n*   Hong Kong was the Mainland's third largest trading partner in 2024, and their total trade value accounted for 5.0% of the Mainland's total trade. Hong Kong was the Mainland's second largest export market, taking up 8.1% (HK$2,243.4 billion) of its total exports in 2024.\n*   The value of Hong Kong's total imports from the Mainland was HK$2,144.7 billion, accounting for 43.6% of Hong Kong's total imports in 2024. Meanwhile, the Mainland was Hong Kong's largest domestic export market, absorbing HK$20.4 billion worth of goods. In 2024, the value of goods re-exported through Hong Kong from and to the Mainland was HK$3,780.4 billion, accounting for 84.3% of Hong Kong's total re-export trade value.\n*   In terms of investment, the Mainland was Hong Kong's largest source of inward direct investment. At end-2023, investment from the Mainland accounted for about 31.1% of the total stock of Hong Kong's inward direct investment which was equivalent to HK$5,167.6 billion.\n*   Mainland companies also maintain a strong presence in Hong Kong. As at mid-2024, Mainland companies had established 2 620 regional headquarters and regional or local offices in Hong Kong.\n\n### Key areas of work\n\n1.   To consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as international financial, transportation and trade centres as well as an international aviation hub;\n2.   To develop an international innovation and technology hub;\n3.   To expand the scope of development for sectors in which Hong Kong's strengths lie;\n4.   To strengthen infrastructural connectivity;\n5.   To foster youth innovation and entrepreneurship; and\n6.   To fully utilise Hong Kong's international connections and networks to promote the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area overseas and attract capital and talents to the Greater Bay Area.\n\nGBA Cities\n\nHong Kong\n\nHong Kong\n\nMacao\n\nGuangzhou\n\nShenzhen\n\nZhuhai\n\nFoshan\n\nHuizhou\n\nDongguan\n\nZhongshan\n\nJiangmen\n\nZhaoqing\n",

(https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/itinerary-design-competition/en/home/index.html)\nOverview\nHome (https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/home/index.html)\nOverview\nPrint (javascript:;)\nOverview\nThe Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area) comprises the two Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao, and the nine municipalities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing in Guangdong Province. The total area is around 56 000 km\n2\n. Based on the latest figures provided by the Guangdong Province, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (SARG) and the Macao SARG, the total population in the Greater Bay Area is over 87 million and the GDP is over RMB 14 trillion in 2024.\nThe development of the Greater Bay Area is accorded the status of key strategic planning in the country's development blueprint, having great significance in the country's implementation of innovation-driven development and commitment to reform and opening-up. The objectives are to further deepen cooperation amongst Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, fully leverage the composite advantages of the three places, facilitate in-depth integration within the region, and promote coordinated regional economic development, with a view to developing an international first-class bay area ideal for living, working and travelling.\nOn 1 July 2017, witnessed by President Xi Jinping, the National Development and Reform Commission and the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao signed the\nFramework Agreement on Deepening Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Cooperation in the Development of the Greater Bay Area (https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/filemanager/en/share/pdf/Framework_Agreement.pdf)\nin Hong Kong.  The Framework Agreement sets out the goals and principles of cooperation and establishes the key cooperation areas in the development of the Greater Bay Area.  Since then, the relevant Central Government departments and the three governments have strived for policy breakthroughs with an innovative and open mind in taking forward the development of the Greater Bay Area jointly.\nBeing the most open and international city in the Greater Bay Area, Hong Kong is known for its status as international financial, transportation, trade centres and aviation hub as well as its renowned professional services. Enjoying the dual advantages of \"one country, two systems\", Hong Kong plays an important role in the Greater Bay Area Development. On the one hand, Hong Kong will facilitate and support the economic development of the region, with a view to enhancing the role and functions of the Greater Bay Area in the country’s two-way opening up; on the other hand, we will facilitate the development of industries in which Hong Kong’s strengths lie in the Greater Bay Area, capitalising on Hong Kong’s strengths to serve the country's needs.\nThe promulgation of the\nOutline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/filemanager/en/share/pdf/Outline_Development_Plan.pdf)\non 18 February 2019 signified a new milestone in the development of the Greater Bay Area.  With the full support of the Central Government, the Hong Kong SAR will proactively integrate into the overall national development, thereby expanding our scope of development and generating new impetus for growth to bring new development opportunities to different sectors of the community, especially our young people.\nTop (javascript:;)\nFacebook Page (https://www.facebook.com/hk.bayarea)\nInstagram (https://instagram.com/hk.bayarea)\nYoutube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-CXf5d5EQ65af1XQjjwMvA)\nWeChat (https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/social/index.html)\nYouku (http://i.youku.com/i/UNjEzNjIyMDk1Ng==?spm=a2hzp.8244740.0.0)\nw3c (http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance)\nRelated Links (https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/related-links/index.html)\nContact Us (https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/contact-us/index.html)\nSite Map (https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/sitemap/index.html)\nImportant Notices (https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/notices/index.html)\nPrivacy Policy (https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/privacy/index.html)\n© 2018 Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau",

It focuses in particular on Singapore, which offers a unique platform for business in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific area, and where many Bay Area companies have established major regional operations. In doing so, it looks at the distinctive synergies between the Bay Area and Singapore around technology, innovation, urban development, and other fields where priorities and capacities align.\n\nAbout This Report \n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nThis report was developed and written by Sean Randolph, Senior Director at the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.

ASEAN, much like the European Union and other multinational economic communities, endeavors to increase economic prosperity through economic, political, social, and cultural cooperation. The ASEAN member nations compose a region with a population of 650 million that has sustained high growth for more than three decades.\n\n### Singapore and ASEAN’s Five Fast-Growing Economies at a Glance, 2017–2018\n\n[![Image 3](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Exhibit1EconomiesAtAGlance.jpg)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Exhibit1EconomiesAtAGlance.jpg)\n\n### As Manufacturing Shifts from China, Southeast Asia Will Be the Primary Beneficiary\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, many Southeast Asian economies lost ground to China, whose size and growth attracted international investment at a large scale. Since 2015, however, they have regained ground. This has been driven in part by rising costs in China, trade conflicts with the US and other countries driven by Chinese industrial and technology policies, and challenges faced by overseas companies in accessing China’s market. As US companies look to diversify their Asian presence, economic growth and rising middle classes in Southeast Asia offer an alternative destination in the region.\n\n### The Region’s Internet Economy is Growing Rapidly\n\n*   There were more than 360 million internet users in the six leading countries in 2019—100 million more than in 2015.\n*   More than 90% of Southeast Asians connect to the internet primarily through smartphones, making Southeast Asia one of the most mobile-first internet regions globally.\n*   In 2019, Southeast Asia’s internet economy reached an estimated $100 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) across the online travel, e-commerce, online media, and ride hailing sectors—up 40% from 2018.\n*   Internet economy investment in the region has grown at an exponential pace since reaching the $1 billion mark in 2015. The inward funding flow reached a record high of $14.1 billion in 2018, and internet firms raised $7.6 billion in the first 6 months of 2019, about 7% more than in the first half of 2018.\n*   Governments across the region are capitalizing to accelerate the delivery of government services digitally.\n*   This activity is reflected in increasingly vibrant startup ecosystems.\n\n[Read the Full Report (PDF)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/files/pdf/SingaporeAndTheBayAreaJanuary2020.pdf)\n\nSingapore's Economy\n-------------------\n\nPlanning Execution, and Open Markets\n\n[![Image 4](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SkylineAndMerlionADJUST1280x457.jpg)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SkylineAndMerlionADJUST1280x457.jpg)\n\n Since its independence in 1965, Singapore has evolved from a small trading center to become a major transshipment port, an international financial center, a regional base for multinational corporations, and a production center intimately linked to global supply chains. It is now aspiring to become a regional center for technology and innovation. Strategically, its economy has been moving progressively toward higher value activities.\n\n*   Global Rankings: Global indexes consistently rank Singapore among the world’s most competitive and innovative economies.\n*   Government Strategies: Singapore’s government engages deeply in economic planning and has been extraordinarily effective in the development and execution of medium and long-term strategies. In contrast to many countries, execution is a priority and existing plans are closely monitored and adapted as conditions change.\n*   The Push for Innovation: Singapore’s government is attempting to build a local innovation ecosystem. A work in progress, its push builds on initiatives led by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the National Research Foundation (NRF), and the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE).\n*   A Focus on Startups: BLOCK71 provides Singaporean and other startups one-stop access to supportive services; the program’s seven buildings now house 250 companies and 30 incubators and venture firms, and there are additional facilities in Indonesia, China, and San Francisco. Fusionopolis and Biopolis, facilities in Singapore’s one-north area, are designed to stimulate concentrated key technology clusters. EDBI (the investment arm of the Economic Development Board), Singtel Innov8, SG Innovate, and SEEDS Capital invest in startups across multiple stages. Sovereign wealth funds GIC and Temasek invest globally in both listed companies and startups.\n\n[Read the Full Report (PDF)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/files/pdf/SingaporeAndTheBayAreaJanuary2020.pdf)\n\nThe Bay Area and Singapore\n--------------------------\n\nExpanding Economic Ties and Business Opportunities\n\n[![Image 5](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14532384255_e39ca942e1_oFlickr-NigelSwalesADJUST1280x457.jpg)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14532384255_e39ca942e1_oFlickr-NigelSwalesADJUST1280x457.jpg)\n\n### An Important Trade and Investment Relationship\n\nDespite its small population, Singapore is an outsized trading partner.\n\n*   Under a free trade agreement between the United States and Singapore that has been in place since 2004 supporting two-way market access in goods, services, investment, and government procurement, US goods exports to Singapore are subject to zero tariffs, and US service exports receive national treatment (meaning that US service suppliers are treated the same as domestic suppliers).\n*   Two-way trade, already strong before the agreement was signed, has continued to grow, reaching $90 billion in goods and services in 2018, with a positive trade balance.\n*   Singapore is California’s 12th largest global export market, with sales of $4.435 billion in 2018.\n*   Singapore was the 6th fastest-growing source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States in 2018. The stock of Singaporean FDI in the US totaled $54.2 billion in 2018, while the stock of US FDI in Singapore totaled $218.8 billion. \n\n### The Bay Area in Singapore\n\nAlong with other global companies, Bay Area companies have a substantial presence in Singapore, making it a business hub for Southeast Asia whose reach also extends to East Asia, Australia, and in some cases to India. Many factors lie behind this, including favorable tax policies, a high quality of life for expatriates, and a central location in Southeast Asia with access to efficient transportation networks. Singapore’s open economy and rule of law offer a stable long-term base.\n\n### Singapore in the Bay Area\n\nReflecting the Bay Area’s central role as a global technology and innovation hub, Singapore’s government has established a significant footprint in the region. By leveraging its assets, the goal is to support entrepreneurial activity, attract investment, and more deeply connect the two innovation ecosystems. Presences include the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), Enterprise Singapore (ESG), BLOCK71 San Francisco, Smart Nation, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore’s sovereign wealth funds GIC (Government Investment Corporation) and Temasek, and startups and corporate connections.\n\n[Read the Full Report (PDF)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/files/pdf/SingaporeAndTheBayAreaJanuary2020.pdf)\n\nSingapore and ASEAN\n-------------------\n\nBuilding New Synergies\n\n[![Image 6](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wengang-zhai-yzi2t_p8n5Q-unsplash1280x457.jpg)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wengang-zhai-yzi2t_p8n5Q-unsplash1280x457.jpg)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEconomic growth in Singapore and the ASEAN region is offering new opportunities for Bay Area and California companies and organizations to expand or diversify their presence in Asia. Of 18 high-growth “outperformers” identified in a September 2018 McKinsey Global Institute study of high-growth emerging economies, four long-term outperformers—Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia—are ASEAN member countries. Underlying this performance are pro-growth policies, fueled by strong competitive dynamics. Young populations, rising middle classes, increased technological capacity, and an explosion of internet and mobile activity are driving the process. Singapore in particular offers a business environment characterized by open markets, transparency, and the rule of law.\n\nThese developments are producing new synergies with the Bay Area based on investment, R&D, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity. These opportunities, led by Singapore as a unique regional platform, will continue to expand as Southeast Asia grows in strategic and economic importance.\n\n[Read the Full Report (PDF)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/files/pdf/SingaporeAndTheBayAreaJanuary2020.pdf)\n\nGet Email Updates\n\n*   Name* First Last  \n*   Email*  \n\n![Image 7: Bay Area Council Economic Institute Logo](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/themes/bacei/img/logo.png)\n\n**Bay Area Council Economic Institute**\n\n The Historic Klamath, Pier 9\n\n San Francisco, CA 94111\n\n Phone: (415) 981-7117 • Fax: (415) 981-6408 •[Email](mailto:bacei@bayareacouncil.org)\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bay-area-council)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/bayareaeconomy)\n\nNotifications\n\n*   [Tweet](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection on Twitter\")\n*   [Facebook](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection on Facebook\")\n*   [](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection by email\")\n\nShare this selection \n*   [Tweet](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection on Twitter\")\n*   [Facebook](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection on Facebook\")\n*   [](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection by email\")\n",

It does not represent in any way a forecast or projection by MAS or by me. My intention is merely to paint a plausible scenario for Singapore. I can only be sure that someone reading this in 2065 will view it as totally lacking in imagination or realism or both.\nProfessor Euston Quah, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.\nThis year, Singapore celebrates 100 years as an independent nation. The Global-Asian Economic Review, or GAER, is relatively young, at 25 years old. But the GAER comes from a long tradition that goes back to the very beginnings of Singapore.\nIt began life as the Malayan Economic Review in 1956, was renamed the Singapore Economic Review in 1969, and took new birth as the Global-Asian Economic Review in 2040.\nAs the leading journal on economic issues that lie at the intersection of the world and Asia, the GAER's evolution has mirrored that of Singapore itself - starting life as part of Malaya, becoming independent, and then expanding its vision to become a Global-Asian entity limited neither by geography nor history.\nWe are a young nation by the standards of other countries but a hundred years is not a flash in the pan either. Amidst the centennial celebrations, it is worthwhile recalling the journey that Singapore has made as a nation since its humble beginnings in 1965. As this is a gathering of economists, I will do so in the form of a brief economic history of Singapore over the last century.\nOur economic progress in a nutshell\nLet me begin by reviewing the economic progress we have made as a nation in the last 100 years, from three perspectives, namely the level, generation, and distribution of income.\nFirst, the level of income. I will use Gross Domestic Product rather than Gross National Income since the GNI measure that we use today is not available for the earlier years.\nIn 1965, Singapore's nominal GDP per capita was around US$500. We were at the same level as Mexico and South Africa.\nIn 1990, GDP per capita had risen to about US$13,000, surpassing South Korea, Israel, and Portugal.\nIn 2015, GDP per capita was about US$56,000. We had caught up with Germany and the United States.\nBy 2040, when our GDP per capita had reached US$96,000, we were already among the top-ranked countries in the world and our benchmark became cities. We were among the top 25 cities then.\nToday, in 2065, GDP per capita is US$120,000, fifth highest among cities in the world.\nSecond, the generation of income. Just as important as the level of income is: how we produced it, and what resources did we use?\nOutput per hour worked has increased considerably.\nIn 2015, Singaporeans worked 2,300 hours.\nThis year Singaporeans are expected to work only 1,400 hours.\nBut we are now generating nearly three times as much income as 50 years ago.\nThe carbon intensity of our economy has fallen sharply.\nIn 2015, we emitted 0.2 kilograms of carbon to produce a dollar of output.\nToday, we emit just 0.05 kilograms.\nThird, the distribution of income.\nIncome distribution has become more equal, thanks to heavy investments in building human capital and skills as well as a tax and transfers system that has become more progressive over the years.\nIn 2015, the Gini coefficient after taking account of taxes and transfers was 0.41.\nToday, it is 0.36.\nWealth inequality has remained more stubborn though.\nToday, the top 1% and 10% of wealth holders in Singapore own around 20% and 60% of total wealth respectively.\nThis is little changed from 30 years ago, when we first started to collect this data.\n1965-1984: Export-led industrialisation through multinationals\nIn 1965, when Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia, few expected it to survive let alone prosper. Singapore's first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, had said in 1957 that the idea of an independent Singapore was a \"political, economic, and geographical absurdity\". It is not hard to see why.\nAn island of 580 squares kilometres at low tide, Singapore in 1965 had no natural resources, no hinterland, no industry.\nIt depended on the outside world not just for food and energy, but even water.\nIndustrial strife was common. Unemployment was close to 9%.\nSingapore's birth pangs were traumatic.\nSeparation from Malaysia meant the loss of not just a common market but a hinterland.\nIndonesia's Confrontasi cut off Singapore's southern hinterland, further undermining the fledgling nation's traditional role as an entrepot trading post for the region.\nIn 1968, the British government announced a withdrawal of its troops from Singapore, which left thousands of workers without a job and as much as a fifth of the economy at risk of coming to a halt.\nSurviving as a nation and creating a better life for the people were thus the over-riding priorities. And economic growth was seen as the principal means to help achieve this.\nThe government made two strategic decisions - both sharply at odds with the conventional economic wisdom of the time.\nThe first was to shift away from import-substitution in favour of export-led industrialisation.\nThe second was to attract global multinational corporations as vehicles to achieve industrial growth.\nThese two decisions proved to be among the most important in our economic history. Promoting exports and promoting foreign direct investments at a time when few other countries were doing the same gave Singapore a decisive advantage.\nBut it was an advantage that Singapore had to work hard to realise.\nThe government developed industrial land, put in place infrastructure facilities, reformed labour laws to promote industrial peace, and invested in basic education with emphasis on technical skills relevant to industrialisation.\nSound fiscal and monetary policies ensured macroeconomic stability and underpinned investor confidence.\nThe two strategies paid off handsomely.\nBy 1975, Singapore had established a substantial industrial base, with manufacturing's share in GDP climbing to 22% from 14% in 1965.\nThe economy was at full employment and it was clear that Singapore had to move up the value chain towards more capital-intensive and skill-intensive activities.\nThe compositional change within manufacturing was striking.\nIndustrialisation began in the 1960s with factories producing items such as matches, fish hooks and mosquito coils.\nBy the way, for those unfamiliar, mosquitoes used to spread life-threatening diseases in the tropics in those days until the disease-causing ones were eradicated in 2033 by genetic modification.\nIn any case, these labour-intensive industries saw a steady decline through the 1970s.\nBy the late 1970s and early 1980s, we saw the emergence of strong clusters in higher value-added electronics, petrochemicals, component and precision engineering.\nIn the 1980s, Singapore became the world's leading producer of hard disk drives - an early form of memory storage used in computers at the time.\nThe first two decades of Singapore's economic history could be described as the \"take-off\" phase. It was the period when the economic fundamentals of prudent public finances, sound monetary policies, co-operative industrial relations, outward orientation, and market-based strategies took root. The economy grew by an average of about 10% each year during this period, and Singapore emerged as a newly-industrialised economy at the forefront of developing countries.\n1985-2010: Liberalisation and the rise of modern services\nIn 1985, the Singapore economy went into recession - the only time in our history the domestic economy contracted while the global economy was still growing. The 1985 recession exposed structural strains in the economy, which had hitherto been masked by strong economic growth.\nAs the earlier phase of \"catch-up\" growth came to an end, resource constraints and diminishing returns to investment began to set in.\nThe cost advantage that Singapore enjoyed began to narrow.\nThe 1985 recession was a significant milestone in Singapore's development history. It led to a fundamental review of the policies and strategies that prevailed at the time. The most important outcomes from that period of review which continued into the 1990s were the structural reforms to:\nenhance wage flexibility in the labour market;\ntap more decisively into regional markets for trade and outward investment;\nstep up the pace of industrial upgrading;\npromote innovation, enterprise, and entrepreneurship in the economy; and\nliberalise various services sectors such as finance, telecommunications, and utilities.\nIn fact, the key story post985 recession up till the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 was the rise of modern services as a twin engine of growth alongside manufacturing.\nThe share of modern services in GDP increased steadily, from 16% in 1965 to 24% in 1985 and 28% in 2010.\nFinancial services\n. Singapore was already a thriving regional financial centre since the 1970s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the insurance and securities industries were completely liberalised and progressive steps were taken to open up the domestic banking industry to foreign competition.\nBusiness services\n. A broad range of business activities - accounting, law, advertising, and consultancy - grew in importance, playing an important role in cementing Singapore's status as a regional hub.\nInfo-communications services\n. The government embarked on a plan to computerise the civil service in the early 1980s. This helped to kick-start the info-communication services industry, one of the mainstays of the economy ever since.\nEntertainment services.\nIn 2005, the government decided to allow two casinos to operate within integrated resorts that also included leisure facilities, business and convention zones, and high-end retail outlets. This sparked the growth of a thriving entertainment services industry over the next few decades, attracting the burgeoning Asian middle class.\nThis second phase of our economic development essentially saw the transition of Singapore from Third World to First World. By 2010, Singapore was an affluent society and a global city, at the cross-roads of international flows of trade, investment, finance and talent. Real GDP grew an average 6.7% per annum during this period.\nIt was also a period in which the economy was buffeted by one crisis after another:\nthe Asian Financial Crisis in 1998;\nthe collapse of the global IT industry in 2001;\nthe spread of the deadly SARS virus in 2003; and\nthe Global Financial Crisis in 2008\nBut the economy grew in resilience, rebounding sharply and emerging stronger after each economic shock.\n2011-2025: Demographic slowdown and economic restructuring\nThe dominant theme in the third phase of Singapore's economic history was the overcoming of resource constraints through a significant restructuring of the economy. While Singapore had always been short of land and labour, these constraints came to a head in the 2010s.\nBy 2011, annual growth in the total working age population had declined to less than 3%, and continued to fall steadily over the decade.\nForeign labour, which had driven Singapore's labour force growth since the late 1970s, was already one-third of the total workforce.\nIt was neither economically efficient nor socially desirable to allow the foreign workforce to expand much faster than the local workforce. By 2020, average total labour force growth was down to 1% per annum.\nThe central thrust of economic strategies in the 2010s and early 2020s was therefore to shift to a productivity-driven growth model. The aim was to increase productivity growth to at least 2% per annum, from the 1.4% averaged during the 2000s.\nThe growth of lower-skilled foreign labour was curbed through increases in the foreign worker levy and reductions in the foreign worker dependency ratio ceilings.\nFinancial incentives were given to firms to undertake capital deepening and adopt technology solutions to raise productivity.\nProgrammes were put in place to help Singaporeans develop and master skills in new growth clusters.\nWhile the manufacturing sector had continually undergone restructuring and moved up the value chain in the preceding five decades, this was the first time the entire economy was undergoing such a transition.\nIt proved particularly challenging for many traditional domestically-oriented services like retail, hospitality, construction, real estate, and social services, which had come to be heavily dependent on cheap labour over the decades.\nWhile many firms in these sectors successfully upgraded themselves and became more efficient, there was a substantial reduction in the size of these sectors by the early 2020s.\nBut the decisive turnaround in the quest for productivity came when services industries with a traditionally domestic orientation, like education and healthcare, re-positioned themselves by scaling up, investing in technology and talent, and exporting their services.\nThe idea of Singapore as a Global School House was not new but it was pursued with renewed vigour and came to full fruition only during this period. Singapore positioned itself as a choice location for quality education for a growing Asian middle class.\nBy 2025, international students studying in Singapore could be awarded joint degrees from 10 of the top 20 universities in the world.\nSingapore was well on its way to become the premier educational hub of Asia.\nSimilarly, the healthcare sector was opened up.\nBy 2025, Singapore had become a multi-faceted medical hub hosting the world's top medical professionals and multi-national healthcare companies.\nThis led to a vibrant ecosystem that created jobs in areas from research and training to conventions for medical professionals both locally and abroad, in addition to the large and diverse number of good jobs in hospitals.\nThis third phase of Singapore's economic history marked the most significant step-down in Singapore's economic growth, with real GDP growing by 3.6% per annum. However, it also marked the painful but successful economic transition towards productivity-led growth. By 2025, the economy had matured, with productivity growth accounting for virtually all of economic growth.\n2026-2040: Regional integration and technological transformation\nThe fourth phase of Singapore's economic development saw the fruition of the decades-long quest for regional integration and the rise to prominence of what we refer to today as our offshore economy. This was also the period that saw widespread technological transformation and the emergence of the ideas economy.\nBy 2040, the global centre of economic gravity had shifted decisively to Asia.\nChina was by far the largest economy in the world, with per capita incomes approaching that of upper middle income countries.\nIndia emerged as the third largest economy in the world, with the largest middle class and a global network of indigenous multinationals.\nBut perhaps most significant for Singapore was the emergence of Indonesia as the fastest growing economy in the world, following far-reaching economic reforms in the early 2020s.\nSingapore's high-end manufacturing and modern services benefitted significantly from trade and investment links with these Asian giants, in addition to the Unites States and the North Euro Area.\nBut the real game-changer was the setting up of two supra-national economic zones.\nIn 2028, Malaysia and Singapore got together to set up the Iskandar-Singapore Economic Zone or ISEZ: one economic system spanning two sovereign countries.\nThe experiment succeeded beyond expectations, providing global and regional investors an integrated production and services base that was unmatched in Southeast Asia.\nIn 2030, the most ambitious blueprint of the ASEAN Economic Community process came into being, with the establishment of the ASEAN Free Economic Zone, or AFEZ.\nUnlike traditional economic zones like the ISEZ which were contiguous entities, the AFEZ was a network of the major cities across ASEAN connected by extensive road, rail, air, and sea links, not to mention advanced digital communications.\nThere was free movement of goods, services, capital, and people between these cities, which become vibrant hubs for trade and enterprise.\nWhile the bulk of the economic benefits of the AFEZ rightly accrued to the developing economies of Indo-China, Singapore benefitted from being the nerve centre of this network with extensive backward and forward linkages between the offshore economy and the territorial economy.\nThe Singapore economy which had hitherto been characterised by the export of goods and services was increasingly being driven by the export of capital and people.\nSingapore firms shifted a substantial volume of production offshore and increased ownership of production facilities in the AFEZ.\nIncreased connectivity enabled large numbers of Singaporeans to work in the AFEZ while maintaining home in Singapore.\nThe government partnered the private sector to build offshore satellite towns and industrial parks in the AFEZ to cater to the needs of Singapore MNCs and overseas communities.\nThe gross inflows of income derived from the deployment of Singapore's capital and people abroad rose by 50% between 2026 and 2040.\nFor the first time, these inflows exceeded the income repatriated abroad by MNCs operating in Singapore.\nGross National Income (GNI) per capita became the more relevant measure of Singapore's income and standard of living than just GDP per capita.\nThe 2020s and 2030s saw the proliferation and convergence of several technological trends that transformed economies and societies globally.\nRapid progress in digital and mobile technologies, coupled with advanced biometrics and global wi-fi access, made payments virtually costless and highly secure, precipitating an explosion in the growth of digital commerce and digital finance.\nAdvances in cloud computing, big data analytics, smart sensors and learning machines transformed the provision of consumer and business services, including financial, legal, auditing, consultancy, and logistics.\nThey also spurred a transformation in the provision of social and public services such as telemedicine, online learning, and congestion control, substantially enhancing efficiency and consumer welfare.\nSingapore was well-positioned for the pervasive digitisation of the global economy that occurred in the 2020s and 2030s, mainly due to two key initiatives that it embarked on in 2015 in the drive towards productivity-led growth:\nThe first was the concerted national effort to build and deepen skills at all levels through extensive worker retraining programmes and subsequent introduction of the teaching of digital technology across the education system.\nThe second was the drive to create a Smart Nation - building critical infrastructure and capabilities in digital and sensor technologies.\nBy 2040, a thriving ideas economy had taken root in Singapore, with value-added embedded in ideas rather than physical form.\nThe creation of economic value was associated increasingly with \"dematerialised products\" such as telecommunications, algorithms, software, design, testing and research.\nAt the same time, Singapore built on its traditional strengths in the ideas economy, namely marketing, branding, and global supply chain management.\nAdvances in robotics and 3-D printing helped to spawn new activities in Singapore's offshore facilities in the AFEZ:\nproduction of space vehicles and supersonic jet engines;\nadditive manufacturing of components for electric cars and autonomous vehicles.\nTechnological advances also transformed the structure of the territorial economy.\nCutting-edge biologics to produce drugs for cancer, auto-immune diseases, congenital disorders and dementia emerged as the largest component of manufacturing.\nReal-time genome sequencing for disease control started from scratch to become one of the fastest growing segments within the territorial economy.\nInfrastructure financing became the largest contributor to modern services, with Singapore-based financial institutions and markets financing projects ranging from the Sino-Indian lunar complex to the pan-ASEAN nuclear fusion reactors.\nDuring this period, regional integration and technological advances helped sustain GNI growth of 2.9% per annum and GDP growth at 2.6% per annum, a remarkable performance given the maturing of the economy. But the period was not free of crisis.\nThe Global Cyber Crisis of 2034 triggered the deepest recession in Singapore's history, with the economy contracting by 8.5% that year.\nThe resurgence of smallpox and resultant pandemic in 2039 plunged the global economy into a recession that lasted two years, not to mention the tragic toll on human lives. It remains till today the darkest period in our nation's history.\n2041-2065: Climate change mitigation and adaptation\nBy 2040, climate change had become the defining issue facing the global economy, including Singapore. It has been the key driver of the transformation of our economy over the last 25 years.\nAs recently as 50 years ago, climate change was still a matter of debate internationally, although it was known that global surface temperatures had been rising since 1850.\nBut by 2020, it had been established firmly that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases were the dominant cause of global warming and that climate change on an existential scale was inevitable if urgent actions were not taken.\nIt took the global community another 10 years to reach an agreement on carbon emission reductions.\nThe Global Climate Change Compact of 2030 - with subsequent reviews every ten years - was probably the most important international agreement in history.\nBy committing countries to significant absolute reductions in carbon emissions, it helped slow down and eventually arrest global warming, thereby forestalling calamitous changes in the climate.\nBut in some respects, the Compact was too late. Some degree of climate change and its effects could not be avoided, chief of which was a persistent rise in sea levels.\nAdapting to climate change thus became as important a consideration as mitigating it. In 2041, the government announced a comprehensive programme to restructure the economy and reposition society for the new world emerging in the wake of climate change.\nThe introduction of a carbon tax helped to reduce carbon intensity in economic activities, increase energy efficiency, and modify consumption patterns. By 2055, the green industry emerged as the largest contributor to Singapore's Gross National Income, covering a wide range of economic activities:\nreconfiguration of earlier technologies, such as robots that were powered by electricity, to make them more sustainable in a carbon-constrained world;\ndevelopment of geo-engineering solutions to reduce the earth's capacity to absorb heat and re-freeze the polar ice caps through altering the natural environment;\nresearch, production, and deployment of renewable energy solutions centred on solar, hydrogen, nuclear fusion, algae biofuels, and zero-carbon diesel fuels recycled from atmospheric carbon;\ntrading of carbon emission permits, carbon credit options, and other derivatives to manage carbon-related risks;\nenergy consultancy and engineering services as well as specialty insurance against various kinds of climate change occurrences.\nIn the area of climate change adaptation, the Dyke Construction Programme, launched in 2045, proved critical not only in preventing the ongoing rise in sea levels from inundating our island, but also in generating a variety of ancillary economic activities. Adapting and building on the earlier Dutch designs and technologies, Singapore became a major exporter of dyke solutions to many other coastal cities around the world.\nThe last 25 years have seen perhaps the most significant transformation of the Singapore economy - competitive, dynamic, resilient, and environmentally sustainable. GDP grew by an average 1.5% per annum, and GNI 1.7% per annum.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude.\nI have described the evolution of our economy over the last 100 years, chiefly from the perspective of industrial developments, technological trends, and other global forces. It is a story of continuous restructuring, made possible by a judicious blend of the invisible hand of the market and the visible hand of good government.\nBut the key non-economic factor that made this development journey possible is the culture of our people.\nIt is a culture of innovation. Today, we have a highly productive and engaged workforce with deep skills, continually learning and taking advantage of new technologies, and building meaningful careers. It is this spirit of constant adaptation and lifelong learning that has\nIt is also a culture of resilience. Singapore has undergone various upheavals and crises over the last 100 years - recession, terrorism, pandemic - not to mention the dislocations and anxieties caused by globalisation, technological advance, population ageing, and climate change. Our strength has not been to insulate ourselves from crisis but to bounce back from it, stronger and more resolute.\nFinally, it is a culture of cohesion. We have come this far because we have worked together and stayed together, with those who have done well doing their part for the less fortunate. It is not only about a willingness to pay higher taxes to support an ageing population but the spirit of philanthropy and volunteerism that has taken root in our society, especially over the last 50 years. Our economic success could not have been possible without this deeper social cohesion that has held the nation together.\nAbout the author\nRavi MenonMore from this author (https://www.bis.org/author/ravi_menon.htm)\nRelated information\nMorespeeches from \"Monetary Authority of Singapore\" (https://www.bis.org/cbspeeches/index.htm?cbspeeches_institutions=41)\nCountrypage: Singapore (https://www.bis.org/country/SG.htm)\nTop (https://www.bis.org/review/r150807b.htm#0)\nShare this page\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/share)\n[No Text] (https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle)\n[No Text] (https://www.bis.org/review/r150807b.htm)\nStay connected\nFollow us\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/BIS_org)\n[No Text] (https://www.linkedin.com/company/bis)\n[No Text] (https://www.youtube.com/user/bisbribiz)\n[No Text] (https://www.bis.org/rss/index.htm)\n[No Text] (https://www.bis.org/podcast)\n[No Text] (https://www.instagram.com/bankforintlsettlements/?hl=en)\n[No Text] (https://www.bis.org/emailalerts.htm)\nSign up to receive email alerts\nAbout BIS\nSitemap (https://www.bis.org/sitemap/index.htm)\nFAQ (https://www.bis.org/about/faq.htm)\nContact (https://www.bis.org/about/contact.htm)\nCareers (https://www.bis.org/careers/index.htm)\nTranslations (https://www.bis.org/translations/index.htm)\nLegal information\nTerms and conditions (https://www.bis.org/terms_conditions.htm)\nCopyright and permissions (https://www.bis.org/terms_conditions.htm#Copyright_and_Permissions)\nPrivacy notice (https://www.bis.org/privacy.htm)\nCookies notice (https://www.bis.org/cookies.htm)\nEmail scam warning (https://www.bis.org/about/warning0405.htm)",

Covering 56,000 square kilometres, the 80 million-resident region produced more than 11 trillion RMB in economic output in 2020. Since the return of Hong Kong and Macao to China, collaboration between the three regions has been deepened, leading to increased eco-nomic prowess and greater competitiveness. \n\nMajor business layouts of the three regions \n\nHong Kong focuses on finance, shipping, logistics and modern services. While home to many world-class universities, however, it suf-fers from sluggish economic and social devel-\n\nopment due to difficulties in commercializing \n\nacademic achievements and a lack of industri-al resources. Therefore, it should give play to its advantages in finance, shipping, logistics and modern services to better serve the GBA, while stepping up technology innovation to industrialise academic achievements. Macao is dominated by tourism and leisure. Similar to Hong Kong, its relatively singu-lar economic structure coupled with small geographical area has led to slow growth. Therefore, the government’s decision to al-low Macao and Guangdong to jointly govern the 106-square-kilometer Hengqin Island has provided needed land to help Macao di-versify its economy and achieve sustainable development. Macao should focus on further \n\nZhao Xiande \n\nCEIBS Professor of Operations and Supply Chain Management and Associate Dean (Shenzhen Campus) \n\nCEIBS KNOWLEDGE \n\n## 23 \n\nThe LINK Volume 2, 2022 exploring diversifying economic structures in Hengqin. Meanwhile, Guangdong’s nine major cities have large economic volume, and are well-po-sitioned to support emerging industries, ad-vanced manufacturing and modern services. For Guangdong, the next step should be to promote its emerging industries, step up inno-vation and coordinate more development with other two regions. \n\nHow can the three regions com-plement each other? \n\nThe GBA can achieve greater coordination in a number of ways. First, promoting the con-struction of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macao Science and Technology Inno-vation Corridor to facilitate cross-border ex-change; second, strengthening capital market interconnection and further improving offshore and onshore markets; third, advancing judicial coordination mechanisms for intellectual prop-erty rights; fourth, boosting the coordinated development of shipping and aviation indus-tries between the four places; fifth, fostering closer cooperation in the cultural and creativi-ty industries. Meanwhile, more consideration should also be given to the roles of Qianhai and Henqin to combine institutional innovation and industry development. \n\nThe role of new infrastructure construction in developing the GBA \n\nFrom the perspective of supply chains, new in-frastructure plays a critical role in the upgrade and transformation of the industrial and supply chains in the GBA in the following three ways: \n\nFirstly, to fill in the gap of China’s industrial \n\nand supply chains. Take chips, for example. Currently, China is dependent on overseas sup-plies which can easily be restrained. The tech-nological innovation and industrial transfor-mation of the GBA can propel the research and development of China’s chip industry by lev-eraging Hong Kong’s advantages in innovation and talent, as well as chip design enterprises such as Huawei and Hisilicon in Shenzhen. \n\nF o r G u a n g d o n g , t h e n e x t step should be to promote its emerging industries, step up innovation and coordinate \n\nmore development with Hong \n\nKong and Macao. \n\n> CEIBS KNOWLEDGE\n\n## 24  \n\n> The LINK Volume 2, 2022\n\nSecondly, to enhance the effective coordina-tion of the GBA’s industrial and supply chains to improve the global competitiveness of prod-ucts and services. The key is to integrate the supply chain mindset into the planning and de-velopment process of new infrastructure. For example, while digitally upgrading industrial parks, it is also necessary to plan and coor-dinate industrial and supply chains between different parks so as to create a sound ecology \n\nthat integrates industry and finance. In the pro -cess of building intelligent logistics hubs (such as airports, ports and distribution centres), we should also emphasis the digital networks of different supply chains, making sure they are manageable to help clients optimise the logis-tics supply chain based on data analysis. Thirdly, to promote the national ‘dual car-bon’ goals. Taking charging stations of new energy vehicles as an example, at present, we still have a large number of public charging stations, with the vehicle-pile ratio dropping to 2.9:1. However, in practice, you will find that many public charging stations are slow to charge and some are even broken. Therefore, in the future, the GBA can tap into building high-powered, fast-charging stations and ex-ploring new types of infrastructure such as battery swapping stations to assist the EV transformation. \n\n> CEIBS KNOWLEDGE\n\n## 25\n",

  "https://www.cityu.edu.hk/cshk/OC.pdf": "Title: \n\nURL Source: https://www.cityu.edu.hk/cshk/OC.pdf\n\nPublished Time: Tue, 31 May 2022 07:02:42 GMT\n\nMarkdown Content:\n# Oppor tunities And Challenges Br ought by Institutional Differ ences under \" One Countr y, Two Systems\" \n\n-- In the context of the development of the Gr eater Bay Ar ea \n\nTIAN Yao \n\n# Abstr act \n\nIt has been almost 25 years since Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, which marked the implementation of \"one country, two systems\". The present stage is of monumental value, because we are halfway through the innovative policy of \"one country, two systems\" proposed by Deng Xiaoping, the inventor of the policy, \"not to be shaken for at least 50 years\". It is necessary to sort out the opportunities and challenges of \"one country, two systems\" at this stage.The proposal of the Greater Bay Area Strategy and the design and implementation of relevant policies undoubtedly provide a more intuitive \"microscope\" for us to observe and evaluate \"one country, two systems\". Discussing the opportunities and challenges of \"one country, two systems\" in the context of the Greater Bay Area will crystallize these concepts, and even non-scholars can understand them, which is the motivation of this paper.The framework for this article is very simple. First of all, I will make use of relevant literature to sort out the research status of \"one country, two systems\" under the Greater Bay Area. Then, on this basis, I’ll discuss the unique advantages that the institutional differences under \"one country, two systems\" bring to the construction of the Greater Bay Area and the difficulties that need innovation to overcome. Based on these opportunities and challenges, this paper puts forward suggestions for the follow-up development of the Greater Bay Area, hoping to provide some inspiration for the advance assumptions of policy design. \n\n# Key Wor ds \n\nGBA,One Country-Two Systems,Policy Design,Belt and Road,Socialist Capitalism,Free Market 1.Intr oduction \n\nAs one of the representatives of regional economic cooperation, GBA has its particularity compared with other regional economic collaborative development regions in China, such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and Yangtze River Delta. Since GBA includes two special administrative regions, Hong Kong and Macao, and implements different capitalist systems in the two SARs from mainland China, GBA has become a precedent for innovative and pioneering regional economic cooperation worldwide. Everything has two sides. The difference of systems under \"one country, two systems\" has brought unique advantages to the development of GBA that other urban agglomerations in the world do not have, enabling the Greater Bay Area to make use of the advantages of the two systems at the same time to complement each other and achieve the best integration. However, when policies are implemented, differences and even contradictions may occur between Guangdong Province and Hong Kong and Macao due to inappropriate connection between different systems and blank policy connection. If not properly handled, these contradictions may lead to deviation between the development of GBA and policy planning. This paper will analyze the unique advantages and differences caused by institutional differences under \"one country, two systems\", and try to put forward suggestions on how to skillfully use institutional differences to serve the construction of GBA, so as to make the two systems more smoothly connected. \n\n# 2.Liter atur e Review \n\nLi et al.(2019) pointed out that as one of the regional cooperation in urban agglomeration, the GBA's inherent \"one country, two systems\" provided advantages for its development. They linked the significance of GBA to the Belt and Road Initiative led by China and pointed out that GBA plays an important role in China's integration into international trade cooperation and the establishment of international economic status, which is a key change from the previous positioning of the Pearl River Delta region.Li et al.(2020) took Shenzhen Qianhai Pilot Zone as an example to analyze the disconnection and disunity of standards caused by system differences in the practice of \"one country, two systems\" policy in GBA, and introduced the management adjustments made in response to these difficulties. In terms of law, finance and service, the experience of Qianhai Pilot Zone can provide inspiration and reference for suggestions on maximizing the advantages of institutional differences in this paper.Li et al.(2017) pointed out that Hong Kong, as the second system of \"one country, two systems\", provided institutional supplement and more diverse perspectives for the economic development of GBA and even the whole country. Of course, all this was on the premise of \"one country\". They believe that Hong Kong and Mainland China should agree to develop together as a whole while adopting a different system. This is especially true within GBA.Yu, Hong.(2021) analyzed that Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in GBA are in fact competing with each other because they belong to different customs districts and administrative regions, which makes it challenging for them to build common goals and highly cooperate. This is an obstacle to the economic integration and collaborative development of GBA caused by the division of systems and management modes.Peck, Jamie.(2021) regarded GBA as the best test ground for combining the \"free market\" represented by Hong Kong and Macao with the \"state capitalism\" of Mainland China, and believed that GBA needs to build a new political and economic scale to transcend the gap between the two systems.Chan, Fung.(2020) concluded that Hong Kong's integration into GBA is inevitable, because its positioning is to show the world the possibility and feasibility of economic cooperation between capitalist economy and Mainland China. In this process, measures such as information sharing and allowing stakeholders to carry out discussions can reduce the resistance to the integration of GBA and make the two systems more smoothly combine and integrate.Sun et al.(2020) takes GBA as the research area to analyze the starting point and growth rate of development of cities within GBA. This provides reference information for the discussion of the development gap between GBA cities under the difference of system and the function positioning of synergistic development.Hui et al.(2020) believes that solid infrastructure and strong transportation capacity promote the flow of elements within GBA and play an important role in promoting GBA's regional integration. In this context, it can be inferred that the construction and improvement of infrastructure will help cities within GBA transcend the gap of institutional differences. Overcome resistance to development caused by institutional differences.Weng et al.(2020) tries to provide suggestions for GBA's city positioning and policy improvement by calculating and studying the carrying capacity of cities within GBA. GBA is a representative urban agglomeration in China, and the carrying capacity of each city can provide reference for this paper to summarize the development suggestions under the institutional differences and overcome the related problems caused by the institutional differences. \n\n# 3.Complementar y Advantages under Institutional Differ ences \n\n3.1 The \" Socialist Mar ket Economy\" in Mainland China --The Fir m Backing of The Development of GBA \n\nMainland China implements the socialist system, and its economic system is particularly different from that of Hong Kong and Macao. Although they all follow the law of market economy, the market economy in mainland China is more government-led. Economic development follows the law of market, but the government takes the leading advantage in the economy and has a strong initiative to regulate the economy, which can ensure that the country's economic development is controlled within the normal track. In the development of GBA, Guangdong province, as the representative of implementing the socialist market economic system, plays the role of strong reserve for the economic development of GBA. Due to the strong financial dominance of the state, GBA can have sufficient infrastructure investment and construction, such as the construction of cross-border railway and the planning of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, which are all promoted under the state's leadership. The socialist economic system provides solid support and foundation for regional economic development. And when markets fail, as they usually do in emergencies, governments can take the first step to remedy them. For example, in the era of COVID-19, market failure and economic stagnation have often occurred. When the society is at a standstill due to emergencies, the government is responsible for the unified allocation of resources and the guarantee of minimum living expenses to keep the society running. The most direct manifestation of the advantages of a socialist market economy is that Shenzhen recently used a seven-day period to eliminate the risk of infection, all in a unified arrangement by the government. In the future, Shenzhen's experience can serve as an example for cities in GBA to deal with epidemic risks. This is the institutional advantage of the socialist system reflected in the development of GBA. At the same time, as a region implementing socialist market economy, Guangdong province can provide insurance for the development of \"free market\" dominated economic model for Hong Kong and Macao, so that the two places have enough reserves and capacity to cope with market failure. \n\n# 3.2 The \" Fr ee Mar ket\" System of Capitalism in Hong Kong And Macao Pr ovides Space for GBA to Connect China with The Wor ld \n\nSince Hong Kong and Macao still kept their local system and social life unchanged after their return to China, it means that they are still institutionally \"Western\". Compared with the \"socialist\" market economy model in Mainland China, which is not familiar to western countries, Hong Kong and Macao have become a window for foreign investment in China. As they both belong to the capitalist economic system, foreign investment will trust the economic model of Hong Kong and Macao more in the initial stage of investment. This makes these two SAR's play a special and irreplaceable key role in the development of GBA, connecting China and the world. Moreover, SAR's independent legal system is a big reason for attracting foreign investment. Independent judicial system can provide convenience and guarantee for foreign enterprises to pay taxes and accept management, so that they have greater profit space and development prospects. As an international financial centre, Hong Kong also plays an important role as a hub for financial markets and international trade cooperation in GBA. The practice of GBA has forced Guangdong province and Hong Kong and Macao to carry out very close integration, which is a kind of innovative social experiment. The integration model of Guangdong Province and Hong Kong and Macao explored by GBA can provide examples and references for countries around the world to carry out close trade cooperation and financial circulation with Mainland China, and at the same time speed up China's integration into the world economy, so that China's socialist market economy is more and more recognized internationally. At the same time, due to its special geographical location and policy implications, GBA plays a leading and promoting role in the China-led Belt and Road Initiative, which complement each other and together become an important part of China's national development strategy. \n\n# 4.Inconveniences And Differ ences Br ought by Institutional Differ ences in \" One Countr y, Two Systems\" -- Challenges to The Development of GBA 4.1 Tax And Legal Differ ences -- Ar bitr age in Gr ey Ar eas \n\nDue to the differences between Hong Kong, Macao and the Mainland in taxation, legislation and justice, there are blank areas of supervision in related business management, trade supervision and other affairs. We can regard the areas where the legislation of the two systems is not properly connected as gray areas, which provide possibilities for speculation and arbitrage activities. For example, due to differences in tax systems, the prices of goods in Hong Kong and Macao are different from those in the Mainland. As a result, many people work in cross-border smuggling to earn the price difference, forming the phenomenon of \"water passengers\" in GBA, which disrupts the market order. Companies are also one of the subjects of speculation using laws and tax systems. Due to the differences in taxation policies between Hong Kong and Macao and the Mainland, some enterprises take advantage of the differences in the system to avoid tax arbitrage speculation. \n\n# 4.2 Institutional Differ ences Have Led to Uneven Responses to COVID-19 \n\nFree customs clearance between Hong Kong and the Mainland and Macao has been suspended for more than two years, which has made the actual development of GBA lag behind the strategic layout and policy intentions. The Chinese Mainland has adopted a \"cask theory\" to protect the weakest under the \"socialist\" system, which can be interpreted as a \"dynamic zero clearance\" with Chinese characteristics to protect the safety of its people at the expense of economic growth. So far, most countries in the world have adopted a policy of opening their doors to the outside world and unrestricted daily activities, which is what Hong Kong is implementing. What we can tell is that Hong Kong, Mainland China and Macao have embarked on different anti-epidemic paths. Such differences will deepen divisions within GBA and cause inconvenience and obstacles to exchanges between Hong Kong and other cities in GBA. The choice of the road to fight the epidemic actually comes from the differences in economic systems. As Mainland China is a government-led economic model, the government has the authority and ability to allocate and supplement resources in the face of social emergencies, so that the society can maintain operation even when partial production stops. However, as a capitalist market economy, Hong Kong follows the principle of \"free market\". Under such a system, the losses caused by compulsory regulation of market activities are unbearable and may even cause collateral damage to the society and public opinion. Due to differences in core institutional concepts, it is difficult for Hong Kong and the Mainland to reach a consensus on anti-epidemic policies. The policy inconsistency will lead to a long period of free customs clearance, which will seriously consume the cost of the preliminary construction of the Greater Bay Area and make the implementation of GBA strategy difficult. \n\n# 5.Possible Solutions&Conclusion \n\nIn view of the inconveniences of policy implementation caused by institutional differences in GBA, the government has also paid attention to and taken corresponding policies and measures to solve the relevant problems. For example, in order to promote mutual legal exchange and mutual trust in law enforcement within GBA, lawyers from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao can obtain practicing qualifications in GBA by taking the practice examination. In order to reduce smuggling and arbitrage, Guangdong province has cooperated with the Exit and Entry Authorities in Hong Kong and Macao to control the frequency of entry and exit for ordinary visas, so as to control smuggling activities of speculation and arbitrage. In order to promote the flow of human resources in GBA and make the functional positioning of each city clearer, Guangdong Province has issued corresponding policies on taxation and social insurance for employees from Hong Kong and Macao to minimize the differences caused by institutional differences. Although there are still management challenges and inconveniences caused by institutional differences in GBA, the corresponding adjustments made by the government are developing in a positive direction. In the past, most of the differences in management caused by institutional differences were targeted solutions after problems occurred. In order to minimize the obstacles in the development of GBA, the future policy adjustment can move the threshold forward, predict the possible problems and take possible solutions into account when designing policies, so as to change resolving differences into preventing problems, so as to gain initiative for the smooth development of GBA.

Personal\nInformation within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong\nKong)”\nFacilitation Measure of “Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)”\nThe “Standard Contract for Cross-Boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (the “GBA Standard Contract”) is the first facilitation measure jointly announced by the ITIB and CAC on 13 December 2023 under the “Memorandum”. Its aim is to promote the safe and orderly cross-boundary flow of personal information within the GBA. The relevant facilitation measure will be implemented through administrative arrangements by the Digital Policy Office (DPO) (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer).\nThe facilitation measure of the GBA Standard Contract is now extended to all sectors of industries, promoting more cross-boundary services to benefit the public and businesses while facilitating data flow throughout the GBA.\nIndividuals or organisations who have the need to arrange cross-boundary flow of personal information between Mainland and Hong Kong within the Greater Bay Area are encouraged to adopt the GBA Standard Contract and file with the Digital Policy Office in Hong Kong.\nWhat is the GBA Standard Contract?\nAdopted on a voluntary basis, the GBA Standard Contract refers to the contract entered into between the Personal Information Processor\n1\nand Recipient when conducting cross-boundary flow of personal information within the GBA. It is a pre-designed contract template that outlines the obligations and responsibilities of both contractual parties in protecting the personal information being transferred across the boundary. Individuals and organisations of both Hong Kong and the nine Mainland cities in the GBA (namely, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing) may enter into a GBA Standard Contract, in accordance with the\n“Implementation Guidelines on the GBA Standard Contract” (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf)\n, to facilitate the flow of personal information\n2\nbetween the nine Mainland cities and Hong Kong (i.e., flow of the personal information from the aforesaid nine Mainland cities in the GBA to Hong Kong, and vice versa).\n1\nUnder the GBA Standard Contract, for the Mainland China, the “Personal Information Processor” refers to an organisation or individual who, in the course of personal information processing activities, decide on their own the purpose and the manner of processing. For the HKSAR, it also refers to a “data user” who, either alone or jointly or in common with other persons, controls the collection, holding, processing or use of the data.\n2\nUnder the GBA Standard Contract, the personal information being processed by Personal Information Processors in the Mainland within the GBA, is defined in accordance with the Personal Information Protection Law of the Mainland China. Personal information being processed by Personal Information Processors in the HKSAR is defined in accordance with the interpretation of “personal data” under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance of the HKSAR.\nBenefits of the GBA Standard Contract\nThe GBA Standard Contract streamlines the compliance arrangement of cross-boundary data flow for enterprises, thus facilitating the provision of relevant cross-boundary services in the GBA and bringing convenience to the public and business. It can lower the cost of compliance arrangement in data flow, which further promotes the digital economy and research development in the Greater Bay Area. It also solids the growth of Hong Kong into an Innovation hub and its integration into the GBA region and complement national development.\nWith the facilitation measure in place, the key assessment areas of Personal Information Protection Impact Assessment (PIA) in the GBA Standard Contract are simplified from six to three areas. The GBA Standard Contract, also, lifts the restriction on the volume of cross-boundary flow of personal data that a Personal Information Processor can transfer under the Mainland’s framework. The filing process for the GBA Standard Contract is also shortened to 10 working days. Thus simplifying the assessment areas and saving time and cost. Meanwhile, the processing and export of personal data from Hong Kong will continue to be regulated in accordance with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance of Hong Kong\nRole to Play in Cross-Boundary Data Flow\nThe contractual parties either play the role as the Personal Information Processor or the Recipient in the cross-boundary flow of personal information. Both parties need to comply with the relevant administrative measures, perform filings to protect personal information against risks and safeguard the safe and orderly flow of personal information across the boundary.\nThe Personal Information Processor may provide personal information across the boundary upon a legal and necessary business need. Prior to that, the Personal Information Processor must be in accordance with the law of its jurisdiction to get the consent of the personal information subject. The Personal Information Processor also need to conduct the Personal Information Protection Impact Assessment (PIA) within 3 months before the filing date. By entering into the GBA Standard Contract, the personal information provided across the boundary shall not be transferred to any organisation or individual outside the GBA, including the group of companies, no matter it is the parent or subsidiary corporations of organisation that are situated outside Hong Kong.\nThe Recipient is the receiver of personal information across the boundary. The Recipient is required to ensure the retention period of personal information shall be the minimum time necessary to achieve the purpose of processing. Upon expiry of the retention period, the personal information shall be erased. The Recipient is also required to put in place the technical and management measures to ensure the security of personal information. According to the GBA Standard Contract, the Recipient\nshould not provide personal information to any organisation or individual outside the Greater Bay Area, including to a third party\nor the group of companies, no matter it is the parent or subsidiary corporations of organisation that are situated outside Hong Kong. It needs to be in the same jurisdiction of the Recipient, which is, registered or located in the nine Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area or Hong Kong.\nVideo on “Introduction to the GBA Standard Contract”\n[No Text] (https://youtu.be/Y7gSfKLomcg)\nCantonese (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/tc/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/gbacbdf/cross-boundary_data_flow/index.html#Video_introduction)\nor\nPutonghua version (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/sc/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/gbacbdf/cross-boundary_data_flow/index.html#Video_introduction)\nSteps of Commencing Cross-Boundary Data Flow in the GBA\nSigning of GBA Standard Contract based on the template\nAdoption of the GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis.

What are the benefits of entering the Memorandum between Hong Kong and the Mainland?\nThe National 14th Five-Year Plan promulgated solid support for Hong Kong’s development as an international innovation and technology hub. Facilitating data flow in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (“GBA”) is an important initiative for promoting the high quality development of the GBA, which is conducive to promoting the development of digital economy and smart city in the GBA. To this end, the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau (ITIB) and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) entered into the “Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area” (“the Memorandum”) on 29 June 2023 to foster cross-boundary data flow in the GBA in a safe and orderly manner under the national management framework. The signing of the Memorandum is iconic and a policy breakthrough. It will facilitate enterprises in the GBA and streamline the compliance arrangements for conducting cross-boundary flow of data. Meanwhile, the export of data from Hong Kong will continue to be regulated in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong.\nWhat is the “Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)”?\nThe “Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (“the GBA Standard Contract”), is a facilitation measure formulated jointly by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau (ITIB) under the “Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area” aiming to facilitate the cross-boundary flow of personal information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The adoption of the GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis. It allows individuals and organisations in the Mainland cities within the GBA and Hong Kong to enter into a GBA Standard Contract based on a standardised contract with both contractual parties’ responsibilities and obligations in protecting personal information under the regulations.\nThe GBA Standard Contract refers to the contract entered into between Personal Information Processors and the Recipients when conducting cross-boundary flow of personal information within the Greater Bay Area. The GBA Standard Contract comprises both contractual parties’ responsibilities and obligations, the rights of personal information subjects and related remedies, the termination of a contract, the liability for breach of contract, and other matters.\nUnder what circumstances of the cross-boundary transfer of personal information will the “GBA Standard Contract” be applicable?\nThe GBA Standard Contract is a facilitation measure to promote the cross-boundary flow of personal information in the Greater Bay Area. Adoption of the GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis. The Personal Information Processors and the Recipients should be registered (applicable to organisations)/located (applicable to individuals) in the Greater Bay Area, that is, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing in the Guangdong Province, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. By entering into the GBA Standard Contract, they may conduct cross-boundary flow of personal information from the nine Mainland cities within the GBA to Hong Kong, and vice versa.\nWhat are the edges of Hong Kong regarding cross-boundary data flow? What are the benefits of implementing the GBA Standard Contract?\nData is the key element for promoting innovation and high-quality development. The HKSAR government recognises the strategic role of data in promoting the development of smart city and digital economy.\nUnder the “One Country, Two Systems” principle, Hong Kong allows free flow of information and possesses a sound legal system and its edges in infrastructure investments, financing and Fintech which are conducive to the convergence of global information hub. Meanwhile, Hong Kong is set to leverage the unique advantage of “convergence” of data from the Mainland and overseas, thus providing important elements for the development of smart city and digital economy. In parallel, the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance of Hong Kong has set clear regulations on protecting the privacy and security of personal data. This provides an important legal basis for protection of cross boundary flow of personal data to Hong Kong and enhances the credibility and reliability of data flows.\nFurther on the integration of cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA), the demand for data flow between Hong Kong and other cities in the GBA is increasing. Under the “Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow Within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area”, the Government of HKSAR and the Cyberspace Administration of China jointly introduce the GBA Standard Contract facilitation measure. With the implementation of the facilitation measure, the compliance arrangements of cross-boundary data flow for enterprises would be greatly streamlined, thereby facilitating the provision of relevant cross-boundary services in the GBA and bringing convenience to the public and businesses.\nCan the content of the GBA Standard Contract be altered based on the commercial considerations of both parties?\nNo. The GBA Standard Contract shall be entered into strictly in accordance with the “Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract”,\ntemplates of the GBA Standard Contract (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_a1_tc_en.docx)\nand\nUndertaking (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_a2_tc_en.docx)\n, and cross-boundary personal information transfer shall only be conducted after the GBA Standard Contract has come into effect. Personal Information Processor may agree on other terms with the Recipient, but such terms shall not be in conflict with the GBA Standard Contract. If there is any conflict between the GBA Standard Contract and any other legal documents conducted by both parties, the terms of the GBA Standard Contract shall prevail.\nWhat procedures are required for adopting the GBA Standard Contract?\nAdoption of the GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis. Prior to the cross-boundary transfers of personal information by entering into GBA Standard Contract, the Personal Information Processor shall conduct a personal information protection impact assessment and complete it within 3 months before the filing date.\nThe Personal Information Processor and the Recipient shall, according to its jurisdiction concerned, conduct the filing procedures of the GBA Standard Contract with the Cyberspace Administration of Guangdong Province and the Digital Policy Office (DPO) (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO)) respectively within 10 working days from the effective date of the GBA Standard Contract (that is the signing date of the GBA Standard Contract). For details, please refer to the\n“Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract” (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf)\n.\nWhat should Personal Information Processors (including data users) and Recipients pay attention to when adopting the GBA Standard Contract for cross-boundary flow of personal information?\nAdoption of the GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis. The Personal Information Processor and the Recipient shall understand and observe the\n“Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract” (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf)\nand the\nGBA Standard Contract (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_a1_tc_en.docx)\n, including conditions and requirements for entering into the contract, management procedures, etc. The Personal Information Processor or the Recipient of Hong Kong shall voluntarily undertake to be supervised and managed by the Digital Policy Office (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer).\nThe Personal Information Processor and the Recipient who had entered into the GBA Standard Contract shall fulfill the obligations and responsibilities set out in the contract and undertake the responsibilities to protect personal information concerned. Meanwhile, the processing and export of personal data from Hong Kong will continue to be regulated in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong, including the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.\nIs the GBA Standard Contract applicable to the cross-boundary flow of personal information between Hong Kong and Macau?\nCurrently the GBA Standard Contract is only applicable to cross-boundary flow of personal information between the nine Mainland cities within the GBA (i.e. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing) and Hong Kong, Macau is not included in the scope.\nOur Mainland partner (registered in Mainland cities within the GBA) is planning to provide personal information of citizens who are located in Mainland cities outside the GBA (e.g., Beijing, Shanghai, etc.). Can my organisation (registered in Hong Kong) adopt the GBA Standard Contract to receive such personal information?\nIn adoption of the GBA Standard Contract, the Personal Information Processors and the Recipients must be registered (applicable to organisations)/located (applicable to individuals) in the nine Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area, that is, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing in the Guangdong Province. If your Mainland partners are registered (applicable to organisations)/located (applicable to individuals) in the above-mentioned regions, you may consider adopting the facilitation measure of “GBA Standard Contract” for cross-boundary flow of personal information.\nAccording to the GBA Standard Contract, personal information being processed by Personal Information Processors in the Mainland cities of the Greater Bay Area, is determined in accordance with the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China.\nMy organisation and our Mainland partners have entered into a standard contract for personal information transfer activities in accordance with the Measures on the Standard Contract for Export of Personal Information (“Measures on Standard Contract”). Do we need to re-enter the “Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (“GBA Standard Contract”) for conducting cross boundary flow in the Greater Bay Area?\nThe “GBA Standard Contract” facilitation measure aims to streamline the compliance arrangements for the cross-boundary flow of personal information in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and its adoption is on a voluntary basis.\nThe “Measures on Standard Contract” and the “GBA Standard Contract” facilitation measure are two different arrangements. While the scope of application, requirements, restrictions and management framework, etc., of the “Measures on Standard Contract” and the “GBA Standard Contract” facilitation measure are different, individuals or organisations that conduct cross-boundary transfers of personal information may consider adopting the “Measures on Standard Contract” and/or the “GBA Standard Contract” facilitation measure based on actual circumstances and needs. It is advised to consult legal or professional advice if necessary.\nDue to business needs, my organisation (registered in Hong Kong) needs to transfer customers’ personal information to our partners in Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area. Is it a must to adopt the GBA Standard Contract?\nAccording to the “Guidance on Cross-Boundary Data Transfer: Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” issued by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data of Hong Kong (PCPD), for cross-boundary transfer of personal data within the Greater Bay Area, the PCPD recommends eligible Personal Information Processors and Recipients in the Greater Bay Area to adopt GBA Standard Contract.\nThe adoption of GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis. Individuals or organisations that conduct cross-boundary transfers of personal information may consider adopting GBA Standard Contract based on actual circumstances and needs. It is advised to consult legal or professional advice if necessary.\nWhat should I do if a Personal Information Processor (covers data user) and/or Recipient are found failed to fulfill the obligations and responsibilities as specified in the “Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract and / or the GBA Standard Contract?\nIf any organisation or individual discovers that a Personal Information Processor or a Recipient that conducts cross-boundary flow of personal information within the Greater Bay Area in accordance with\n“Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract” (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf)\nand / or the GBA Standard Contract fails to fulfill its obligations and responsibilities required, they may file a complaint or report to the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Cyberspace Administration of Guangdong Province or the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the Digital Policy Office (DPO) (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO)) and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data Hong Kong (PCPD).\nUpon receipt of complaints or reports, the DPO (or the then OGCIO) shall handle them in accordance with the “Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract”, if necessary, the DPO (or the then OGCIO) shall request the Personal Information Processor or the Recipient to make necessary rectification in case. The DPO (or the then OGCIO) shall work closely with the PCPD, when handling the case.\nThe PCPD will perform their supervisory and management roles under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, including handling complaints, reports, investigations, and handling of illegal personal data processing activities.\nMy Mainland partner is not registered in the Greater Bay Area. Can we adopt the “GBA Standard Contract”?\nNo. To adopt the GBA Standard Contract, the Personal Information Processors and the Recipients should be registered in the Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area, i.e., Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing in the Guangdong Province, or the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).\nThe GBA Standard Contract aims to facilitate cross-boundary flow of personal information in the Greater Bay Area. Will this, in disguise, encourage or cause data users in Hong Kong to transfer the personal data of Hong Kong citizens to Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area?\nThe GBA Standard Contract is a facilitation measure to promote the cross-boundary flow of personal information in the Greater Bay Area and its adoption is on a voluntary basis. Meanwhile, the processing and export of personal data from Hong Kong will continue to be regulated in accordance with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) of Hong Kong.\nBesides, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) had participated to formulate the GBA Standard Contract and provided professional advices in order to ensure the implementation of cross-boundary flow of personal information to the nine Mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area under the GBA Standard Contract shall fulfill the regulations under the PDPO.\nThe GBA Standard Contract is a facilitation measure being implemented through administrative arrangements by the Digital Policy Office, it does not affect the PCPD in performing their supervisory and management roles under the PDPO.\nMy organisation (registered in Hong Kong) has already entered into the GBA Standard Contract with our Mainland partner for the cross-boundary flow of personal information. Do we or our Mainland partner need to conduct the filing procedures?\nAccording to the\n“Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract” (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf)\n, the Personal Information Processor and the Recipient\n(i.e., both contractual parties) are required to conduct the filing procedures of the GBA Standard Contract\nwithin 10 working days from the effective date of the GBA Standard Contract (that is the signing date of the GBA Standard Contract).\nThe contractual party (whether as a Personal Information Processor or a Recipient) registered / located in Hong Kong shall conduct the filing procedures with the DPO (or the then OGCIO). For details, please refer to the\nSteps of Commencing Cross-Boundary Data Flow in the GBA (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/gbacbdf/cross-boundary_data_flow/index.html#steps)\n.\nThe contractual party (whether as a Personal Information Processor or a Recipient) registered / located in the nine Mainland cities within the GBA (i.e. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing) shall conduct the filing procedures with the GDCAC. For details, please refer to the\nAnnouncement by Cyberspace Administration of Guangdong Province on Facilitation measure on “Standard Contract for Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information Within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (Chinese only) (https://www.cagd.gov.cn/v/2024/01/4401.html)\n.\nIt is noted that our Mainland partner (as Personal Information Processor) has conducted the filing procedures in Mainland as required. Do we still need to conduct the filing procedures as a Recipient in Hong Kong?\nYes. In accordance with the\n“Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract” (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf)\nthe Personal Information Processor and the Recipient shall, according to the jurisdiction concerned, conduct the filing procedures with the Cyberspace Administration of Guangdong Province and the Digital Policy Office (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer) of the HKSAR Government respectively within 10 working days from the effective date of the GBA Standard Contract (that is the signing date of the GBA Standard Contract). For details, please refer to the\n“Filing Guidelines on Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc02_fg_en.pdf)\n.\nMy organisation (registered in Hong Kong) and our Mainland partner are planning to conduct cross-boundary of personal information from Mainland to Hong Kong and vice versa. Do we need to sign TWO (2) sets of GBA Standard Contract to serve the purposes?\nYes, by adopting the GBA Standard Contract, the Personal Information Processor and the Recipient are subject to different obligations and responsibilities. Therefore, each set of GBA Standard Contract is only applicable to cross-boundary flow of personal information from the nine Mainland cities within the GBA to Hong Kong or vice versa.\nCan we adopt one (1) set of GBA Standard Contract for all personal data, which covers multiple business aspects, of my organisation?\nThe adoption of GBA Standard Contract covers personal information of multiple business aspects and scenarios, such as loan business, syndication, or wealth management, etc., of banking industry, of the same organisation. With a view to save the efforts in entering into several contracts for multiple scenarios, an organisation can adopt one set of GBA Standard Contract covering all scenarios of cross-boundary transfer of personal information, provided that the concerned Personal Information Processor and the Recipient as well as purposes on cross-boundary transfer of personal information are same in these business scenarios.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced the “Provisions on Promoting and Regulating Cross-border Data Flow (the Provisions)” on 22 March 2024. Under the Provisions, are Personal Information Processors still required to adopt the “Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (“the GBA Standard Contract”)?\nOn 22 March 2024, the CAC announced the Provisions which lifted certain restrictions on conducting cross-border data transfer from the Mainland with a view to facilitate cross-boundary data flow under the national regime of protecting data security. The Provisions lifted certain restrictions regarding the need of entering into “Standard contract for cross-border transfer of personal information”, which are applicable to the GBA Standard Contract.\nIf data has been transferred to Hong Kong, can it be viewed through internet beyond the GBA (for example Singapore or other cities)?\nNo. According to The GBA Standard Contract, Article 3 (7); Personal information received through the GBA Standard Contract should not be provided to organisations / individuals outside the GBA (including transfer; storage; access).\nUseful Reference

in Review: Singapore’s incentives and schemes for global businesses and local enterprises\n27 Dec 2023\n27 Dec 2023\n6\n6 min read\n[No Text] (https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/2023-in-review-singapores-incentives-and-schemes-for-global-businesses-and-local-enterprises.html&title=)\nFrom AI to supply chain to talent, innovation and sustainability, Singapore announced new incentives and schemes this year to support global businesses and local enterprises as they position themselves for growth. Here are the highlights:\nINNOVATION\nIn Budget 2023, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong announced a new\nEnterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS) (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/budget-2023-new-scheme-enhances-tax-deductions-for-innovation-activities.html)\nthat enhances tax deductions for businesses working on five key activities that boost innovation. The tax deductions will be raised on qualifying expenditure for activities such as R&D conducted in Singapore, registration of intellectual property and innovation carried out with polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education.\nBesides the EIS, Singapore has other incentives and schemes to encourage businesses to upgrade their capabilities or expand the scope of their business operations here. EDB’s\nCorporate Venture Launchpad (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/incentives-and-programmes/corporate-venture-launchpad-programme.html)\nprogramme helps companies incubate innovative business ideas that have the potential to grow into globally competitive businesses from Singapore.\nGlobal companies can also partner with Singapore government agencies to drive their innovation mandate in the region. This year,\nJohnson & Johnson International inked a first of its kind collaboration with EDB (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/johnson-and-johnson-innovation-announces-collaboration-with-edb-to-help-transform-singapore-life-science-innovation-ecosystem.html)\nto boost life sciences innovation in the region. US biotech venture creation company Flagship Pioneering, best known for its role in backing Moderna,\nopened its regional hub in Singapore (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/flagship-pioneering-expands-into-asia-pacific-region-with-regional-hub-in-singapore.html)\n, seeking to boost new collaborations with the healthcare and life sciences industry in APAC.\nInteresting fact:\nSingapore was ranked top in Asia and fifth in the world, in the 2023 Global Innovation Index. The World Intellectual Property Organization, which put together the index, noted that Singapore’s performance was due to government effectiveness, access to information and communications technology (ICT) and a thriving venture capital environment.\nSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT\nSingapore is emerging as a preferred supply chain management (SCM) hub for manufacturers and brand owners to orchestrate regional and global supply chains, and build new capabilities for more efficient and resilient supply chain operations. As such, there is a growing demand for talent with advanced digital knowledge and skills in SCM.\nIn 2023, EDB and SkillsFuture Singapore launched the\nSupply Chain Management (SCM) Skills Plan (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/market-and-industry-reports/supply-chain-management-skills-plan-staying-relevant-in-a-fast-changing-global-supply-chain-landscape.html)\n- a one-stop reference document on the trends shaping new SCM jobs and the available reskilling support offered in Singapore.\nClick here to learn how businesses are futureproofing their supply chains from Singapore (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/from-semiconductors-to-consumer-goods-heres-how-businesses-are-shaping-and-future-proofing-global-supply-chains-from-singapore.html)\n, and read more about\ntrends in APAC supply chain networks (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/market-and-industry-reports/findings-from-the-2023-gartner-trends-in-apac-supply-chain-network-survey.html)\n, a report by consulting firm Gartner.\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting existing industries and reshaping how business is done. Singapore is supporting companies in finance, e-commerce, healthcare, and professional services to develop technical prototypes for new AI applications through generative AI models.\nSingapore continues to\ninvest in AI research and development efforts (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/about-S500-million-invested-in-ai-innovation-in-last-5-years-josephine-teo.html)\n, having already invested over $500 million in the last five years. On December 4, Singapore launched a\nrenewed AI strategy (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/singapore-updates-ai-strategy-with-aim-to-contribute-globally-valuable-breakthroughs.html)\nthat will see it:\nMore than triple the number of AI practitioners, including machine-learning scientists and engineers to 15,000. This will be done by training locals and hiring from overseas\nEstablish a dedicated site to nurture the country’s AI community\nIncrease government incentives for the AI sector, including by backing accelerator programmes for AI startups and encouraging companies to set up AI “centres of excellence”\nThe\n“AI Trailblazers” initiative (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/mci-disg-sndgo-and-google-cloud-launch-ai-trailblazers-initiative-to-accelerate-the-development-of-impactful-generative-ai-solution-singapore.html)\n, launched by government agencies including\nDigital Industry Singapore (https://www.imda.gov.sg/disg)\n, and Google Cloud, allows Singapore-based businesses to tap on Google Cloud’s AI toolsets to create generative AI products, hence accelerating the development and adoption of AI solutions.\n“Our top priority is to be quite AI-forward as a nation, to establish Singapore as a thriving hub for AI innovation. To achieve this, we will continue to invest in the key enablers that support this vision,” said Jacqueline Poh, Managing Director of the Economic Development Board, at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Public Sector Day conference in October 2023.\nTALENT\nSingapore has enhanced its workpass framework to attract complementary global talent, including those with skills in high demand. Take a look at the different hiring schemes and\npasses here (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/hiring-and-talent/hiring-talent-in-singapore.html)\n.\nIn 2023, Singapore rolled out a new points-based\nComplementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/singapores-employment-pass-all-you-need-to-know-about-compass.html)\nto assess Employment Pass (EP) applications for non-local employees. This is aimed at giving businesses greater clarity and certainty for manpower planning. New EP applicants will need to score 40 points to pass COMPASS, which considers several firm and employee-related attributes, such as the firm’s nationality diversity and the individual’s qualifications. Those in occupations requiring specialised skills that are currently in shortage are eligible for bonus points.\nSingapore’s policies to attract global talent are in addition to efforts to develop and strengthen its local talent pool through training and upskilling programmes. There is also the\nSingapore Leaders Network (SGLN) (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/leadership-network-that-primes-singaporeans-for-work-abroad-marks-its-first-year.html)\n, which was formed to increase the global and regional exposure of Singaporean talent so that they can take up leadership positions in global firms.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nSingapore boosted its transition to clean energy this year, with\nthree major initiatives (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/3-highlights-for-singapore-international-energy-week-2023.html)\naround the use of hydrogen as a fuel source, clean energy imports and centralised procurement of natural gas announced at the Singapore International Energy Week 2023.\nBy 2035, businesses will be able to connect to up to 4GW of imported low-carbon electricity (making up 30 per cent of projected electricity supply) from regional power grids by 2035, alongside efforts to expand solar, energy storage and low-carbon alternatives.\nClean energy imports\nSingapore’s energy regulator, the Energy Market Authority, granted six conditional approvals to import low-carbon electricity this year. In March, Keppel Energy was given conditional approval to import 1GW of low-carbon electricity from Cambodia. In September, EMA granted\nconditional approvals to five (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/singapore-to-start-imports-of-renewable-energy-from-indonesia-within-5-years.html)\nprojects to import a total of 2GW of low-carbon electricity from Indonesia into Singapore. There are also plans for an ASEAN power grid to integrate the national power systems of the 10 member countries.\nSolar, energy storage and low-carbon alternatives (including hydrogen)\nSingapore intends to have at least 2GWp of solar capacity installed by 2030, allowing it to meet the annual electricity needs of about 350,000 households. As of end-2022, Singapore has a solar capacity of over 820 megawatt-peak and there is a collective effort to boost solar deployment across the public and private sectors, and individual households.\nIn February, SembCorp announced it had built a\nnew, large-scale battery storage system (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/sunny-days-ahead-for-solar-adoption-in-singapore.html)\non Jurong Island that can store excess solar energy generated in the day to be used at times of higher electricity demand. In July, Keppel held a groundbreaking ceremony for its\nnew hydrogen-ready power plant (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/new-hydrogen-ready-power-plant-to-be-built-by-2026-as-singapore-seeks-greener-energy-generators.html)\n, which will have a lower carbon footprint than conventional power plants and can operate on fuels with 30 per cent hydrogen content. In November,\nTuas Power (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/tuas-power-to-buy-green-energy-from-12-3b-solar-plants-near-batam-from-2027.html)\nsaid it had signed an agreement with an Indonesian renewable energy company to import solar energy generated on Batam to Singapore.\nCarbon services\nEDB welcomes companies providing services such as carbon advisory, project development, trading and more to set up headquarters in Singapore. Close to 100 organisations here provide carbon services, and the\nInternational Emissions Trading Association launched its Asia hub (https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/ieta-launches-asia-hub-in-singapore-to-support-carbon-market-initiatives.html)\nin Singapore in June. That same month, Singapore-based carbon exchange Climate Impact X (CIX) launched its global spot trading platform to boost the liquidity of carbon offset trading and set a benchmark price for nature-based carbon credits. Singapore has also published\na list of eligible host countries, programmes and methodologies (https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/)\nunder its International Carbon Credit framework, which will allow companies to offset up to five per cent of their taxable emissions beginning in 2024.\nAt COP28, Singapore and organisations based here announced new initiatives to support and accelerate the green transition in our region and beyond.

Resident taxpayers pay a progressive tax on personal income. For tax year 2024 and beyond, the highest marginal rate is 24% for income above S$1 million.\n1\nSingapore generally doesn't tax capital gains.\n2\nNote that all figures in this article are quoted in\nSingapore dollars (SGD) (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sgd-singapore-dollar.asp)\n.\nThis kind of tax policy, and a location that makes it a gateway for companies that want to expand into emerging Asian economies, make this island city-state a global hub for international investment and commerce.\nKey Takeaways\nSingapore is lauded as a center for international trade and finance.\nIt is considered a tax haven with several favorable policies for people living and doing business there.\nThe country offers several tax breaks, boasts a relatively low corporate tax rate and top personal tax bracket, and does not levy taxes on capital gains.\nSingapore's Corporate Rates\nThe corporate income tax rate in Singapore is a flat 17%. However, the effective\ncorporate tax rate (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatetax.asp?o=40186&l=dir&qsrc=999&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&ap=investopedia.com)\ncould be lowered by other incentives introduced by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore.\n3\nStartups (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp)\nin Singapore can take advantage of a tax exemption of up to S$125,000 on the first S$200,000 of income for their first three consecutive years of business. To qualify for the startup tax exemption, companies must be incorporated in Singapore and have a maximum of 20 shareholders. If all shareholders are not individuals, then at least one shareholder must be an individual who holds a minimum of 10% of shares.\n3\nCompanies that have not previously claimed the Tax Exemption for New Start-Up Companies can claim the Partial Tax Exemption for Companies. This allows for an exemption of up to S$102,500 on the first S$200,000 of chargeable income.\n3\nFast Fact\nBetween tax years 2017 and 2023, the top marginal rate was 22%. The highest tax bracket was defined as income above S$320,000.\n1\nOther Tax Breaks\nSingapore also offers\ntax exemptions (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax_exempt.asp?o=40186&l=dir&qsrc=999&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&ap=investopedia.com)\nfor businesses in certain industries. These include breaks for qualifying foreign banks, offshore funds, and global trading companies.\nBanks are eligible for a withholding tax exemption on payments to non-resident companies made between April 1, 2011, and December 31, 2026, that are based on agreements that take effect between those dates.\n4\nQualifying offshore funds are also exempt from tax on some income, including income from dividends, gains, profits, and interest from traditional investments including deposits, bonds, shares, stocks, and securities.\n5\n6\n7\nGlobal trading companies are eligible for concessionary tax rates of 5%, 10%, and 15% for five years if they qualify for Singapore's Global Trader Programme. Singapore typically grants Global Trader status to companies with established track records in international trade.\n8\nOversight in Singapore\nBanks and financial institutions in the city-state are required to exercise\ndue diligence (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp)\nto help prevent\nmoney laundering (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneylaundering.asp?o=40186&l=dir&qsrc=999&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&ap=investopedia.com)\nand other international criminal activity.\n9\nUnder Singapore law, records are private. As such, financial institutions are not required to provide access to personal data about individuals.\n10\nHowever, Singapore provides exceptions to banking confidentiality agreements upon request by foreign authorities in cases where accounts were used to shield criminal activity.\n11\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates its financial institutions.\n12\nHow Stable Is Singapore's Economy?\nSingapore's economy is considered to be safe and stable. According to the World Bank, the nation functions on a \"high-income\" economy with strong investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and public services. Its regulatory environment is very business-friendly. Singapore's economic growth was 1.1% in 2023 and the country ranked among the top countries in human capital development.\n13\nHow Do I Invest in Singapore?\nThere are different ways to take advantage of Singapore's growth. You can invest directly in companies based in the island nation by trading stocks through a brokerage account. You can also purchase\nAmerican depositary receipts (ADRs) (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp)\nthat trade on domestic exchanges, shares of\nexchange-traded funds (ETFs) (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)\n, and/or mutual fund shares that have Singaporean companies and assets (like bonds) in their portfolios.\nWhat Is a Tax Haven?\nA tax haven is a jurisdiction that offers favorable tax treatment to individuals and corporations, specifically to those who don't permanently reside there. Tax havens may offer low tax rates, secrecy, asset protection, and financial privacy. They may also waive any residency requirements for favorable treatment. Some of the most common tax havens include the Cayman Islands, Switzerland, Bermuda, and Singapore.\nThe Bottom Line\nTax havens are often characterized by favorable tax treatment, especially when it comes to offshore corporations. This is one reason why Singapore is often considered to be one. Startups can take advantage of tax exemptions and capital gains are generally not taxed in the country. Singapore also provides financial privacy as long as there is no criminal activity suspected.\nCorrection—Oct. 20, 2022:\nThis article has been edited from a previous version that misstated the currency for the marginal income tax bracket in Singapore as United States Dollars instead of Singapore Dollars.\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Income\n-----------------------------\n\nForeign income refers to income derived from outside Singapore. Generally, such income is [taxable in Singapore](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/taxable-non-taxable-income \"taxable in Singapore\") when remitted to and received in Singapore. Where the foreign income arises from a trade or business carried on in Singapore, it is taxable in Singapore upon accrual, regardless of whether it is received in Singapore.\n\nIn many cases, foreign income is taxed twice - once in the foreign jurisdiction and a second time in Singapore.\n\nThere are tax reliefs available to Singapore tax residents to alleviate the double taxation suffered, such as:\n\n*   Exemption or reduction in tax imposed on specified foreign income that is derived in a jurisdiction that has an Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement with Singapore\n*   Tax exemption on specified foreign-sourced income such as foreign-sourced dividends, foreign branch profits and foreign-sourced service income under Section 13(8) of the Income Tax Act 1947\n*   Foreign tax credit for the taxes paid in the foreign jurisdiction against the Singapore tax payable on the same income\n\nExpand all\n\n[### Claiming Benefits under Avoidance of Double Tax Agreements](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income#claiming-benefits-under-avoidance-of-double-tax-agreements)\n\nAn Avoidance of Double Tax Agreement (DTA) is an agreement between Singapore and another jurisdiction (i.e. a DTA partner). It serves to relieve double taxation of income that is earned in 1 jurisdiction by a resident of the other jurisdiction.\n\nOnly Singapore tax residents and tax residents of the DTA partner can enjoy the benefits of a DTA. Find out who are our [DTA partners](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/international-tax/list-of-dtas-limited-dtas-and-eoi-arrangements).\n\n### Purpose of DTAs\n\nA DTA states the taxing rights between Singapore and her DTA partner on the different types of income arising from cross-border economic activities between the 2 jurisdictions.\n\nThe DTA also provides for reduction or exemption of tax on certain types of income.\n\n* * *\n\nWhere the benefit under the DTA is not an exemption of tax but a reduction of tax rate, the Singapore company may have to pay tax in both the foreign jurisdiction and Singapore.\n\nThe DTA provides relief for this double taxation by allowing the Singapore company to claim a credit of the foreign tax suffered against its Singapore tax payable on the same income.\n\nLearn more about this credit, also known as [Double Tax Relief](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-reliefs/foreign-tax-credit).\n\n* * *\n\n### For Singapore Tax Resident Companies\n\nSingapore tax resident companies can claim benefits under the DTA (i.e. the company is exempt from tax or subject to withholding tax at a reduced rate in the foreign jurisdiction) when they derive foreign income from a DTA partner.\n\nTo claim DTA benefits, the company must show the DTA partner that it is a tax resident of Singapore by:\n\n*   [Applying for a Certificate of Residence (COR)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/applying-for-a-certificate-of-residence-tax-reclaim-form)\n\nThis is a letter certifying that a company is a tax resident of Singapore for the purpose of claiming tax benefits under the DTAs.\n\n*   [Seeking IRAS’ certification of a tax reclaim form](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/applying-for-a-certificate-of-residence-tax-reclaim-form)\n\nThe DTA partner may require the company to submit a tax reclaim form issued by that jurisdiction together with or in place of a COR.\n\n### For Tax Resident Companies of our DTA Partners\n\nTax residents of our DTA partners can claim benefits under the DTA (i.e. the foreign company is exempt from tax or subject to withholding tax at a reduced rate in Singapore) when they derive income from Singapore.\n\nTo claim DTA benefits, they have to show IRAS that they are a tax resident of the DTA partner by submitting a completed Certificate of Residence that is duly certified by the tax authority of their country/ territory of residence.\n\nLearn how to [claim tax relief/ exemption under the DTA for non-resident companies](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-filing/claim-of-relief-under-the-avoidance-of-double-tax-agreement-(dta)).\n\n[### Tax Exemption on Specified Foreign-Sourced Income](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income#tax-exemption-on-specified-foreign-sourced-income)\n\nSingapore tax resident companies may enjoy tax exemption on specified foreign-sourced income that is remitted into Singapore.\n\n### Scope of Specified Foreign-Sourced Income\n\nForeign-sourced income is foreign income that does not arise from a trade or business carried on in Singapore.\n\nThe 3 categories of specified foreign-sourced income are:\n\n*   Foreign-sourced dividend\n*   Foreign branch profits\n*   Foreign-sourced service income\n\n### Qualifying Conditions for Tax Exemption\n\nUnder Section 13(9) of the Income Tax Act 1947, tax exemption is granted when **all**of the following 3 conditions are met:\n\n1.   The foreign income has been subject to tax in the foreign jurisdiction from which it is received (known as the '[subject to tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income#subjectToTax)' condition). The rate at which the foreign income was taxed can be different from the headline tax rate;\n2.   The highest Corporate Income Tax rate (i.e. [foreign headline tax rate](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income#foreignHeadline) condition) of the foreign jurisdiction from which the income is received is at least 15% at the time the foreign income is received in Singapore; and\n3.   The Comptroller of Income Tax is satisfied that the tax exemption is beneficial to the Singapore tax resident company.\n\n#### 'Subject to Tax' Condition\n\nTo meet this condition, the specified foreign income received in Singapore must have been subject to tax in the foreign country/ territory from which the income is received.\n\n* * *\n\n##### For Substantive Business Activities\n\nThe Comptroller of Income Tax will regard the ‘subject to tax’ condition as met if the income is exempt from tax in the foreign jurisdiction due to tax incentive(s) granted for substantive business activities carried out in that jurisdiction.\n\nThe following documents must be prepared and [retained for at least 5 years](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements) from the relevant Year of Assessment (YA):\n\n*   A declaration by the company that the foreign jurisdiction has exempted the foreign income from tax because of substantive business activities carried out by the company in that jurisdiction\n*   A copy of the tax incentive certificate/ approval letter issued by the foreign jurisdiction. In the case of a foreign-sourced dividend, a dividend voucher (if available) stating that the dividend is exempt from tax due to tax incentive granted to the dividend-paying company for carrying out substantive business activities in that foreign jurisdiction is sufficient\n\n* * *\n\n##### For Foreign-Sourced Dividends\n\nFor the purpose of this ‘subject to tax’ condition, tax paid or payable on foreign-sourced dividend received in Singapore includes:\n\n*   The dividend tax, which is income tax levied on the dividend by the foreign country/ territory of source\n*   The underlying tax, which is income tax paid or payable by the dividend paying company on the income out of which the dividend is paid\n\nThe following documents must be prepared to substantiate that the underlying tax has been paid on the income out of which the foreign-sourced dividend is paid:\n\n*   **Audited accounts of the foreign dividend paying company**\n\nTo demonstrate that its foreign-sourced dividend has suffered underlying tax, the company can provide the audited accounts of the foreign dividend paying company for the financial period ending in the year before the year the dividend is received in Singapore. The accounts must show a positive current year tax (excluding deferred tax expense).\n\nIRAS is also prepared to accept the consolidated accounts of the foreign dividend paying company and its group companies as proof that the ‘subject to tax’ condition has been met. However, the foreign dividend paying company must be:\n\n*   A company listed on a stock exchange; and\n*   An operating company carrying out substantive business activities (investment holding is excluded). This must be supported by evidence such as description in the consolidated accounts or any official publication showing the principal activities of the foreign dividend paying company to be such (as opposed to the Group).\n\nThe consolidated accounts of the foreign dividend paying company and its group companies for the financial period ending in the year before the year the dividend is received in Singapore must show a positive current year tax (excluding deferred expense).\n\nFor example, if the dividend is received in Singapore on 30 Jun 2023, the consolidated accounts of the foreign dividend paying company and its group companies for the financial year 2022 must show a positive current year tax.\n\n*   **Alternative documents accepted**\n\nIRAS also accepts the following documents to show that the income of the foreign dividend paying company has been subject to tax:\n\n*   A certification from the bank through which the taxpayer invested into the foreign dividend paying company\n*   A confirmation letter from the foreign dividend paying company that foreign tax has been paid on the income out of which dividends are paid\n\nIf you are unable to secure any proof that tax has been paid on the income of the foreign dividend paying company, the ‘subject to tax’ condition will not be considered met.\n\nThe relevant information/ documents must be [retained for at least 5 years](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements) from the relevant YA.\n\nIRAS may review and modify the use of alternative documents should there be any cases of abuse.\n\n* * *\n\n#### 'Foreign Headline Tax Rate of at least 15%' Condition\n\nDividend is considered to be sourced in the jurisdiction that the dividend paying company is tax resident of. Where the dividend paying company is a non-Singapore tax resident, the dividend is considered foreign-sourced.\n\nForeign-sourced dividend may be paid by a company listed on the stock exchange in 1 jurisdiction (e.g. Hong Kong) but tax resident of another jurisdiction (e.g. Bermuda). Hence, it cannot be presumed that the jurisdiction of the listing of the dividend paying company is where the dividend is sourced.\n\nWhere a dividend paying company is incorporated outside the jurisdiction where it is listed, the Comptroller of Income Tax may treat the dividends as not sourced in the jurisdiction of listing unless there are facts to show otherwise. In such a circumstance, the ‘headline tax rate condition’ will be considered not met if the jurisdiction in which the dividend paying company is incorporated has a headline tax rate of less than 15%.\n\n### Expenses Incurred in Respect of Foreign-Sourced Income\n\nAll expenses incurred in respect of foreign-sourced income received in Singapore that qualifies for tax exemption must be deducted against such foreign-sourced income. These expenses are not available for deduction against any other taxable income.\n\n### How to Claim Tax Exemption\n\nTo enjoy the tax exemption, you have to provide the following information in your Corporate Income Tax Return (Form C):\n\n*   Nature and amount of income received\n*   Jurisdiction from which the income is received\n*   Headline tax rate of the foreign jurisdiction\n*   Confirmation that foreign tax has been paid in the jurisdiction from which the income is received. This is to satisfy the ‘subject to tax’ condition\n\nIf you are filing Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite) instead of Form C, you should include the above information in the company's tax computation and [retain any supporting documents/ information for at least 5 years](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements) from the relevant YA.\n\n[### Foreign Tax Credit](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income#foreign-tax-credit)\n\nCompanies may claim foreign tax credit for tax paid in a foreign jurisdiction against the Singapore tax payable on the same income.\n\nLearn more about [foreign tax credit](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-reliefs/foreign-tax-credit). \n\nRelated Content\n---------------\n\n[Pages ### Foreign Tax Credit](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-reliefs/foreign-tax-credit)[Pages ### Applying for a Certificate of Residence/ Tax Reclaim Form](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/applying-for-a-certificate-of-residence-tax-reclaim-form)[Pages ### Tax Residency of a Company/ Certificate of Residence](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/tax-residency-of-a-company-certificate-of-residence)[Documents ### Tax Exemption for Foreign-Sourced Income (PDF, 286KB)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/tax-exemption-for-foreign-sourced-income285e5d43d6af4001b3ce35da1e9005b5.pdf?sfvrsn=b5092fba_16)\n\nInland Revenue Authority of Singapore\n-------------------------------------\n\n*   [Careers](https://www.iras.gov.sg/careers)\n*   [News & Events](https://www.iras.gov.sg/news-events)\n*   [Useful links](https://www.iras.gov.sg/useful-links)\n\n[SUBSCRIBE TO OUR eALERTS](https://www.iras.gov.sg/subscribe-to-iras-ealerts)\n\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.iras.gov.sg/contact-us)\n*   [Feedback](https://www.iras.gov.sg/feedback)\n\n*   [IRAS Facebook![Image 140](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/icons-png/facebook4a61cfb7-4fe2-4283-91a6-6742f7d304a0.png?sfvrsn=d2b12b17_1)](https://www.facebook.com/irassg)\n*   [IRAS Instagram![Image 141](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/icons-png/instagram.png?sfvrsn=f1ceb65b_1)](https://www.instagram.com/irassg/)\n*   [IRAS TikTok![Image 142](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/asr/tiktok.png?sfvrsn=a94f28bf_1)](https://www.tiktok.com/@irassg)\n*   [IRAS Twitter![Image 143](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/asr/icons8-twitterx-25-(5).png?sfvrsn=f8edd28a_1)](https://twitter.com/IRAS_SG)\n*   [IRAS LinkedIn![Image 144](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/icons-png/linkedin.png?sfvrsn=3a5ebaa8_1)](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/iras)\n*   [IRAS Youtube![Image 145](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/icons-png/facebook.png?sfvrsn=cb691f57_3)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVWvCzqueXUdrT7VdnrnpaQ)\n*   [Add Telegram Icon to IRAS Website![Image 146](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/assets/telegram-icon.png?sfvrsn=7ed4fd83_6)](https://t.me/irassg)\n*   [IRAS Whatsapp![Image 147](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/asr/whatsapp.png?sfvrsn=15eeb3ea_1)](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VZzNwbsEAKW8218Tl60R)\n\n*   [Report Vulnerability](https://www.tech.gov.sg/report_vulnerability)\n*   [Privacy Statement](https://www.iras.gov.sg/privacy-statement)\n*   [Terms of Use & Browser Compatibility](https://www.iras.gov.sg/terms-of-use-browser-compatibility)\n*   [Sitemap](https://www.iras.gov.sg/sitemap)\n\n© 2025, Government of Singapore\n\nLast updated on 13 June 2025\n\nChat with IRAS\n\n![Image 148: Bot Avatar](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/asr/irasbot-avatar.png)\n\n![Image 149: Bot Avatar](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/asr/irasbot-avatar.png)\n\nIRAS Bot\n\nRate chat\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nPowered by GovTech\n",

The trade -related and modern services clusters, \n\nwhich posted strong outturns in Q4 2021, contracted sequentially in Q1 \n\n2022. In comparison, the domestic -oriented cluster saw a broad -based \n\nexpansion. Within the travel -related cluster, performan ce was uneven, with \n\ngains in the air transport and arts, entertainment & recreation (AER) \n\nsectors partially offset by a sharp pullback in the accommodation sector. \n\n• Supply shocks arising from the Russia -Ukraine conflict have introduced \n\nrenewed uncertaintie s surrounding the outlook for the rest of the year , at \n\na time when global supply chain frictions arising from the pandemic have \n\nyet to be fully resolved. Supply -driven price shocks are eroding real \n\nincomes and could lead to an aggregate demand shock. A static analysis \n\nof global trade and input -output linkages suggests that Singapore’s direct \n\nand indirect exposures to Russia through the income and production \n\nchannels are relatively small. However, the impact could be amplified by \n\nconfidence effects arisin g from higher inflation, tighter financial \n\nconditions , and heightened uncertainty, which would restrain domestic \n\nconsumption and investment. \n\n• Meanwhile, Singapore took a major step towards living with COVID -19 by \n\neasing domestic safe management measures an d border restrictions \n\nsubstantially at the end of March. Reduced restrictions will bring forward \n\nthe projected recovery in the domestic -oriented and travel -related sectors \n\nto Q2, earlier than the previous expectation of the second half of this year. \n\nHoweve r, external -oriented sectors such as manufacturing, wholesale \n\ntrade, water transport and financial services could face some headwinds \n\namid the less optimistic global economic outlook. Barring further \n\nescalation in the Russia -Ukraine conflict or a severe se tback to the \n\nimproving trajectory of the pandemic , the Singapore economy remains on \n\ntrack to grow by 3 –5% in 2022, its second year of above -trend growth. \n\n• From a longer -term perspective, the restructuring of the Singapore \n\neconomy has yielded greater pro ducti vi ty gains in the tradable sector over \n\nthe past decade , with higher returns accruing to capital owners and \n\nspecific segment s of skilled labour . Consequently, the gap between wages \n\nin the tradable and non -tradable sectors ha s persisted over time . The next \n\nphase in Singapore’s restructuring journey is likely to see this divergence \n\nnarrow, as market forces and government polic ies , that incentivise \n\ninvestments in productivity -enhancing technologies and processes , for \n\nexample, facilitate the adjustmen ts . Lower - and middle -income \n\nhouseholds are likely to benefit most from this transition .The Singapore Economy 21 \n\n# 2.1 Recent Economic Developments \n\nGDP growth slowed in Q1 as the trade -related and modern services clusters \n\ncontracted sequentially \n\nThe Singapore economy picked up further at the end of 2021, growing by 2.3% q -o-q SA \n\nin Q4 2021, after some weakness in the preceding two quarters (Chart 2.1) . GDP growth in Q4 \n\nwas largely underpinned by strong outturn s in the trade -related and modern services clusters \n\n(Chart 2 .2) . The se clusters were less affected by the pandemic, with activity already \n\nsurpassing pre -COVID levels by end -2020 . However , the domestic -oriented and travel -related \n\nclusters remained below pre -pandemic levels even at the end of last year. \n\nNot unexpectedly, the high growth momentum could not be sustained and  the trade -\n\nrelated and modern services clusters  contracted sequentially  in the first quarter of 2022 ,\n\nresulting in a slowdown in overall GDP growth  to  0. 4% q-o-q SA (based on the \n\nAdvance \n\nEstimates ). In comparison, the domestic -oriented cluster saw a broad -based expansion. The \n\nperformance was uneven in the travel -related cluster, with gains in the air transport and AER \n\nsectors partially offset by a sharp pullback in the accommodation secto r. On a y -o-y basis, \n\noverall GDP increased by 3.4% in Q1 this year, moderating from the 6.1% expansion in the \n\npreceding quarter .\n\nChart 2.1 Singapore ’s GDP growth moderated in \n\nQ1 …\n\n> Singapore’s GDP growth\n\nChart 2.2 … dragged down by trade -related \n\nactivity a nd modern services                  \n\n> Contribution to GDP growth\n> Source: DOS\n> * Advance Estimates\n> Source: EPG, MAS estimates 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022Q1*\n> -15\n> -10\n> -5\n> 0\n> 5\n> 10\n> 15\n> 20\n> Per Cent\n> YOY\n> QOQ SA 2021 Q2 Q3 Q4 2022Q1\n> -2\n> -1\n> 0\n> 1\n> 2\n> 3\n> 4\n> % Point Contribution to\n> QOQ SA Growth\n> Trade-related Modern Services\n> Domestic-oriented Travel-related\n> Others Overall 22 Macroeconomic Review |April 2022\n\nManufacturing activity contributed most to the GDP slowdown in Q1 \n\nSingapore’s Index of Industrial Production (IIP ) contracted by 2. 7% q-o-q SA in Q1 2022, \n\nreversing the 5.6 % expansion in the preceding quarter which was mainly driven by the \n\nbiomedical and transport engineering clusters (Chart 2.3) . Both clusters subsequently saw a \n\npullback in Q1 from the high base in Q4 2021. Meanwhile, electronics output surged in Q1 ,\n\nsupported by strong global demand for semiconductors used in data centres and 5G \n\nproducts , following a mild contraction in Q4 2021. Elsewhere in the trade -related cluster, \n\ngrowth in wholesale trade slowe d in Q1 2022 , reflecting weaker outturns in the machinery, \n\nequipment & supplies subsegment .\n\nChart 2.3 Industrial production contracted in Q1, weighed down by the biomedical and transport \n\nengineering clusters   \n\n> Index of industrial production (IIP)\n> Source: EDB\n\nModern services lost some momentum after posting strong outturns in \n\nprevious quarters \n\nThe modern services cluster expand ed by 2.5% q -o-q SA in Q4 2021, before declining by \n\n2.0% in Q1 this year (Chart 2.4) . Growth in the cluster in Q4 was driven by the finance & \n\ninsurance sector, which was in turn underpinned by the cyclical recovery in other auxiliary \n\nactivities (mainly payme nts processing), fund management and bank ing , as the pandemic \n\nreceded . Similarly, the firm expansion in the information & communications sector was \n\nsupported by strong mobile phone sales amid new product launches , as well as ongoing \n\ncorporate investments i n digitalisation. 60      \n\n> 80\n> 100\n> 120\n> 140\n> 160\n> 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022Q1\n> Index (2019=100), SA\n> Electronics\n> Chemicals\n> Biomedical\n> Precision\n> Eng\n> Transport Eng\n> General Mfg\n> Overall The Singapore Economy 23\n\nChart 2.4 Modern services contracted sequentially in Q1 2022  \n\n> VA growth of the modern services cluster\n> Source: DOS\n> * Advance Estimates\n\nHowever, the growth momentum in modern services dissipated in Q1 this year , led by a\n\ndecline in the information & communications sector. This was driven by l ower outturns in \n\ngames publishing activities, following several quarters of strong performance , which more \n\nthan offset the expansion in the telecommunications and IT & information serv ices segments. \n\nLikewise, growth in the financ e & insurance sector moderated from its Q4 outturn and \n\nwas only marginal ly positive in Q1 2022, dragged down by the fund management and \n\ninsurance segments. The fund management segment fell sharply, as ongoing geopolitical \n\ntensions and the prospect of policy tightening across major economies weighed on global \n\nequities. Meanwhile , the insu rance segment contracted amid a decline in net premiums from \n\ngeneral insurance, although this was partially offset by improved sales of single -premium life \n\ninsurance products. In comparison, activit y in the banks and other auxiliary segments \n\ncontinued to s upport growth. The banks segment was buttressed by higher loans and \n\nadvances to residents in Jan –Feb , while the other auxiliary segment continued to benefit from \n\na pickup in consumer spending. \n\nThe domestic -facing sectors benefited from the gradual easing o f social \n\nrestrictions \n\nDomestic -oriented activities remained generally lacklustre in Q4 2021, weighed down by \n\nrenewed tightening of COVID -19 safe management measures . Under the “Stabilisation \n\nPhase ” which lasted for about two months from late September , som e restrictions were re -\n\nimposed to moderate the transmission rate of the virus and ease the strain on Singapore’s \n\nhealthcare system. These included the reduction in social gathering and dining -in group sizes \n\nfrom five to two persons and the return to a default work -from -home arrangement. \n\nThere was some improvement in the consumer -facing sectors from late November as \n\nsocial restrictions were ease d (Chart 2. 5) . F&B sales expanded by 11.4 % q -o-q SA in Q4 2021, -6       \n\n> -4\n> -2\n> 0\n> 2\n> 4\n> 6\n> 2019 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022Q1*\n> QOQ SA % Growth\n\n24 Macroeconomic Review | April 2022 \n\nand a further 1.7% in Jan –Feb 2022, supported by the measured but progressive relaxation \n\nof dining -in and event restrictions. Sales of both restaurants and food catering services rose \n\nstrongly by 24.0% q-o-q SA and 13.1% respectively in Q4, and by a further 5.9% and 3.4% in \n\nJan –Feb. The land transport sector also expanded in Q1 following the contraction in the \n\nprevious quarter . Public transport ridership picked up, as up to 50% of employees work ing \n\nfrom home were allowed to return to office at the beginning of 2022. In contrast, retail sales \n\ncontracted by 2.4% q -o-q SA in Jan –Feb, following the 4.8% increase in Q4 . W eaker sales were \n\nrecorded at supermarkets as well as provision and sundry shops, with more households \n\ndin ing out at restaurants. Sales of computer & telecommunication s equipment also \n\ncontracted during this period. In general , t he retail sector has outperformed the other \n\nconsumer -facing industries over the last two years , in part reflecting the shift in demand \n\ntowards essential and durable goods and away from high -touch services during the \n\npandemic .\n\nChart 2.5 The F&B sector saw improved outturns in Q1 as social distancing measures were gradually \n\nrelaxed    \n\n> Retail and F&B sales volumes\n> Source: DOS\n\nIn the construction sector , supply -side disruptions continued to affect activity in Q4 last \n\nyear . The sector contracted by 2.1% q -o-q SA, as new border -entry restrictions 1 on migrant \n\nworkers were put in place in early December because of the Omicron variant. As these \n\nrestrictions we re eased from late Feb ruary , alongside some improvement in the supply of \n\nconstruction materials, t he sector returned to growth of 2. 8% q -o-q SA in Q1 2022. While \n\npublic certified progress payments in the construction sector saw broad -based \n\nimprovements in Jan –Feb, private certified progress payments dipped over the same period, \n\nweighed down by the commercial and industrial segments (Chart 2. 6) .                   \n\n> 1Employers were not allowed to make new applications for Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process (CMP) S Pass and\n> Work Permit holders, as well as other dormitory -bound work pass holders, to enter Singapore via Vaccinated Travel Lanes\n> (VTLs ).Such workers could only enter Singapore via ongoing industry initiatives or the Work Pass Holder General Lane .Retail Sales\n> Food & Beverage\n> Circuit\n> Breaker\n> Heightened\n> Alert\n> 40\n> 50\n> 60\n> 70\n> 80\n> 90\n> 100\n> 110\n> Q4\n> 2019\n> 2020 Q2 Q3 Q4 2021 Q2 Q3 Q4 2022\n> Index (Q4 2019=100), SA\n> Jan –Feb\n\nThe Singapore Economy 25 \n\nChart 2.6 Some recovery was seen in certified progress payments in certain subs egments in Q1, \n\nfollowing the easing of border restrictions on construction workers      \n\n> Nominal c ertified progress payments in the construction sector\n> Source: BCA and Haver Analytics\n> * Estimated based on Jan –Feb 2022 data\n> Note: Certified progress payments refer to the value of all construction works done and certified for progress payments of\n> ongoing projects.

Travel activity picked up further in Q1 with the launch of additional VTL s. MICE \n\nevents 2 ha ve also resumed on a larger scale since mid -August last year , with up to 1,000 \n\nvacci nated attendees permitted for each gathering. Average monthly air passengers carried \n\ndoubled in Q1 2022 compared to Q4 last year , to 774 ,692 (Chart 2.7 ). Average monthly visitor \n\narrivals also grew by 55.8 % in Q1 this year to 82,040 , after having tripled in Q4 from the \n\nprevious quarter . Nonetheless, visitor arrivals were still only about 5% of their pre -pandemic \n\nlevels in 2019 .\n\nThe accommodation sector contracted in Q1 2022, extending the weakness from Q4. \n\nThe decline was largely due to a sharp fall in government bookings. With the majority of \n\nCOVID -19 patients being placed on the Home Recovery programme since October last year, \n\nthere has been a steady decline in demand for hotel quarantines. The hotel occupancy rate \n\nfell to 61% in Q1 this year, from the monthly average of 71 % in Q4 2021, reflecting an increase \n\nin the supply of available rooms as the release of government bookings was not fully \n\nabsorbed by a rise in demand from visitor arrivals and staycation s (Chart 2. 8) . The support \n\nfrom utilisation of Singapore Rediscover Vouchers has also waned compared to last year .        \n\n> 2MICE refers to meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions. 2021 Q2 Q3 Q4 2022Q1*\n> -10\n> -5\n> 0\n> 5\n> 10\n> 15\n> 20\n> % Point Contribution to QOQ SA Growth\n> Public Residential Public Non-residential\n> Public Civil Engineering Private Residential\n> Private Non-residential Private Civil Engineering\n\n26 Macroeconomic Review | April 2022 \n\nChart 2.7 The air transport sector improved amid \n\nsome pickup in visitor arrivals …\n\n> Air transport indicators\n\nChart 2.8 … but the accommodation sector \n\nweakened    \n\n> Hotel Bookings\n> Source: CAAS and Haver Analytics Source: STB\n\n# 2.2 Economic Outlook \n\nThe Russia -Ukraine conflict has dented Singapore’s economic outlook, \n\ndampening the recovery momentum expected this year \n\nThe invasion of Ukraine and sanctions on Russia since late February ha ve cast a pall \n\nover the economic outlook. The shock is , in the first instance, supply -driven, initial ly \n\nmanifest ing as higher inflation at a time when global supply chain frictions arising f rom the \n\npandemic have yet to be fully resolved. Supply -driven price shocks will dent real incomes and \n\ncould lead to a pullback in aggregate demand. These factors will continue to play out in the \n\ncoming quarters, adding to significant uncertainty surroundin g the ripple effect s from the \n\nRussia -Ukraine conflict on Singapore’s economic growth. According to the Singapore \n\nCommercial Credit Bureau (SCCB), the Business Optimism Index dipped slightly in Q2 2022 \n\nto +5.35 % points, from +5.91 % points in the previous quarter, primarily due to the geopolitical \n\nuncertaint y from the war in Ukraine exacerbating risks of global supply chain disruptions in \n\nthe short to medium term. \n\nAn analysis of the income and production channels show s that the spil lover effects of \n\nthe conflict on Singapore ’s economy appear to be relatively contained, most ly limited to \n\nRussia’s role as a major global supplier of crude oil and natural gas. However, the impact \n\ncould be amplified by confidence effects amid heightened vo latility in global financial and \n\ncommodity markets. Moreover, higher input costs could curtail production, while higher \n\ninflation and weaker confidence could also restrain domestic consumption and investment. \n\nThe less optimistic global economic outlook will pose some headwinds to external -oriented \n\nsectors such as manufacturing, wholesale trade, water transport and financial services .\n\nThe additional drag on growth prospects from the conflict would be partially offset by a \n\nboost from the easing of domestic safe management measures and border restrictions from \n\nend -March. Th e loosening of restrictions bring s forward the projected recovery in the \n\ndomestic -oriented and travel -related sectors to Q2 , compare d to previous expectations of a \n\nH2 recovery .0                   \n\n> 20\n> 40\n> 60\n> 80\n> 100\n> 120\n> Dec Mar Jun Sep Dec Mar Jun Sep Dec Mar\n> Index (Dec 2019=100), SA\n> Air Cargo Handled\n> Aircraft Landings\n> Air Passengers\n> Carried\n> 2019 2020 2021 2022 2020 May Sep 2021 May Sep 2022\n> 0\n> 50\n> 100\n> 150\n> 200\n> 250\n> 0\n> 20\n> 40\n> 60\n> 80\n> 100\n> S$\n> Per Cent\n> Standard Average Occupancy Rate\n> Standard Average Room Rate (RHS)\n> Mar The Singapore Economy 27\n\nEconomic linkages between Russia and Singapore are relatively limited, \n\nalthough downside risks could be amplified via confidence effects \n\nRussia’s role in the global economy is more as a major energy supplier , accounting for \n\nmore than 10% of global crude oil and natural gas production , rather than a source of final \n\ndemand. Singapore ’s direct trade exposure to Russia is minimal .3 In 2021, imports from \n\nRussia accounted for just 0.8% of Singapore’s total goods impo rts, while exports to Russia \n\ncomprised 0.1% of total exports. Even for petroleum and related products, Russia contributed \n\nonly 2.8% of Singapore’s imports, with Malaysia, UAE, China, Qatar and Saudi Arabia being the \n\nmain source s. Aside from the effect on global commodity prices , there are two main channels \n\nof indirect exposures through which disruptions to Russia’s exports could have knock -on \n\neffects on Singapore: spillovers from external demand ( the income channel), as well as \n\nsu pply chain linkages ( the production channel). These indirect channels were quantified using \n\nthe latest available data from the 2018 OECD TiVA database. \n\nFigure 2.1 traces the indirect income channel , where Singapore’s key export partners \n\nwith significant ex posures to Russia suffer income losses , in turn reducing demand for our \n\nexports . The top five countries and region s with significant final demand VA originating from \n\nRussia in US$ terms were the Eurozone, China, US, Japan and UK (column 1 in Table 2.1) . As \n\na share of each of these economies ’ total final demand, Russia’s embodied VA is relatively \n\nsmall at less than 1% (column 2) .

Instead, the exposure of the industry to Russia \n\nand Ukraine comes from their role as major suppliers of two crucial inputs : Russia produces \n\n37% of the global supply of palladium 4 and Ukraine supplies 70% of neon .5 Major global chip \n\ncompanies such as Micron, UMC and GlobalFoundries , which have production presence s in \n\nSingapore , have thus far indicated limited disruptions as they have stockpiled raw materials \n\nand diversified sourcing since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Singapore imports \n\npalladium main ly from the UK and the US , rather than Russia , although some of Singapore’s \n\npalladium suppliers may themselves be importing from Russia.

At a round the \n\nbeginning of 2020, the industry entered the inventory accumulation phase (Chart 2.9 ). There \n\nwas a surge in final demand for electronics amid global lockdowns and the attendant switch \n\nto working from home and domestic leisure activities, which accelerat ed the structural trend \n\nof digitalisation. The onset of th e pandemic might also have induced panic buying and \n\nprecautionary hoarding of chips by electronics manufacturers. The industry subsequently \n\nentered the expansion phase in late 2020, with robust growth in chip sales leading to a \n\ndrawdown on chip inventory. The tight supply situation persisted throughout 2021, as \n\nindicated by global electronics PMI sub -indices on input prices, suppliers’ delivery time s and \n\nbacklog of work (Chart 2.10) . Towards the end of last year, the escalation in geopolitical \n\ntensions and persistent supply chain challenges triggered another round of hoarding. With \n\nthe outbreak of the Russia -Ukraine conflict , the industry is expected to maintain inventory at \n\na higher level for longer in the face of supply chain uncertainties. Together with s till -firm \n\nglobal chips sales , the inventory accumulation phase of the cycle is expected to extend well \n\ninto 2022.

Investment and consumption demand for electronics, which was robu st during \n\nthe height of the pandemic, ha s shown signs of normalisation in recent quarters. Notably, \n\nafter rapid growth in H1 2021, growth in consumption of IT products in the US and China \n\ndecelerated in H2 (Chart 2.11) . More recently, Apple has reportedly cut its planned output of \n\niPhone and AirPod s devices , citing the Russia -Ukraine c onflict and high inflation as factors \n\nweigh ing on demand for consumer electronics. Similarly , growth in investment demand for \n\ntechnology equipment in the US has eased since the latter half of 2021 (Chart 2.12) .\n\nChart 2.11 Growth in consumption of IT products \n\nhas moderated since H2 last year…      \n\n> Consumption of IT products in US and China\n\nChart 2. 12 … alongside slower growth in \n\ninvestment demand for technology equipment     \n\n> US investment in technology equipment\n> Source: Haver Analytics Source : Haver Analytics\n> Note: The US fixed investment for information processing\n> equipment is used as a proxy for investment in technology\n> equipment.\n\nMeanwhile , supply expansion has continued apace, with global semiconductor capital \n\nspending increas ing strongly by 34% to US$152 billion in 2021 (Chart 2.13) . Chip shortages \n\nand heightened geopolitical tensions have prompted governments to reassess their \n\ncountries’ position s across the semiconductor value chain , roll out new industrial policies ,\n\nand undertake significant investments in semiconductor manufacturing and R&D . In the US, \n\nthe CHIP S for America Act will boost chip manufacturing capacity by establishing a US$5 2\n\nbillion fund to subsidise domestic manufacturing and research. Meanwhile, China’s 14 th Five \n\nYear Plan (2021 –2025) aims to step up support for semiconductor production , includi ng by \n\nreducing or exempting the industry from tax ation, and by helping to build supply chains and \n\nto cultivate talent. \n\nThe global semiconductor value chain is mainly located in advanced economies such as \n\nthe US, South Korea, Japan and Europe. However , a few economies hold significant market \n\nshare in specific segments. For example, South Korea accounted for the principal share of \n\nglobal value added for memory chips at 59% in 2019 , while China and Taiwan comprised 38% \n\nand 27% , respectively, of t he value added for assembly, packaging, and testing (Chart 2. 14 ).\n\nGoing forward, there is a risk of further concentration in the semiconductor value chains \n\nwithin a handful of leading economies undertaking significant investment projects. Minor \n\ndisruptions in the supply of chips from these locations could be amplified into significant \n\nsupply bottlenecks and shortages globally. -60         \n\n> -30\n> 0\n> 30\n> 60\n> 90\n> 120\n> 2009 2012 2015 2018 2021\n> YOY % Growth\n> Q4\n> US\n> China -20\n> -10\n> 0\n> 10\n> 20\n> 30\n> 2009 2012 2015 2018 2021\n> YOY % Growth\n> Q4\n\nThe Singapore Economy 35 \n\nIn addition, t here is potential for some overcapacity in 2023 as large -scale expansions \n\nbegin to come onstream towards the end of th is year.

Slower growth could be offset in part by the \n\npetroleum refining industry , where prices of refined petroleum products such as gasoline and \n\njet fuel might be supported by the continued recovery in fuel demand as more countries relax \n\nCOVID -19 restrictions. Refining margins would be boosted if the rise in product prices \n\noutstrips crude feedstock costs. \n\nAs for the other trade -related sectors, wholesale trade and water transport are also \n\nexpected to see slower growth in 2022 , on a ccount of lower global trade growth and ongoing \n\nsupply disruptions arising from the Russia -Ukraine conflict. Europe’s ports are suffering from \n\ncongestion caused by custom s checks to comply with sanctions . Analysts also warn of a\n\nlabour squeeze in the global shipping industry where Ukraine and Russia account for 14% of \n\ncommercial seafarers. Renewed COVID -19 lockdowns in major port cities in China such as \n\nShanghai and Shenzhen have hamper ed logistics . Modern supply chains are compl ex and \n\ndifficult to dis entangle, and the war in Ukraine , with its associated sanctions, and ongoing \n\nCOVID -19 restrictions are likely to continue hindering trade flows. These disruptions could \n\ncontribute to shortages of key inputs and introduce frictions th at would slow the delivery of \n\ngoods to final consumers .\n\nGrowth in the financial sector could soften amid market uncertainties \n\nThe prognosis for the financial sector has weakened alongside the softer outlook for the \n\nglobal economy and a fall in business and financial market sentiment . The most significant \n\nnegative impact is likely to be felt in the fund management segment , which could experience \n\na material slowdown in growth compared to previous years ’ strong expansions. G lobal \n\nequities could underperform in the months ahead, reflecting the prospect of tighter -than -\n\nexpected monetary policy settings in advanced economies. While the segment’s longer -term \n\nstructural trend of rising wealth inflows from the region remains intact , the short -term outlook \n\ncould weaken amid the slowdown in regional economies, such as China. \n\nIn addition, the cyclical moderation in growth of the domestic and regional economies is \n\nlikely to c urb demand for credit and insurance. Acc ordingly, both the banks and general \n\ninsurance segments are likely to expand at a more modest pace than predicted earlier .\n\nSimilarly, growth in the payments processing industry could soften on the back of weaker \n\nconsumer sentiment, even if it remains suppo rted by the structural shift to e -payments .\n\nIn the quarters ahead , the downside risks to the financial sector remain elevated. First, \n\nslower growth and heightened inflation in the global economy owing to a prolonged Russia -\n\nUkraine conflict or a resurgence in COVID -19 c ould inhibit demand for credit and insurance .\n\nSecond, a f aster -than -expected pace of policy tightening in advanced economies could dent \n\nmarket sentiment and lead to a repricing of financial assets. Finally , a more significant \n\nslowdown in the Chinese economy could have a broad -based impact on the financial sector ,\n\nincluding through lower trade credit demand. 38 Macroeconomic Review | April 2022 \n\nThe s ubstantial easing of mobility restrictions from Q2 w ill hasten recovery in \n\nthe consumer -facin g and travel -related clusters \n\nWith the cresting of the Omicron wave , mobility restrictions were eased significantly \n\nfrom end -March. Social gathering group size s were doubled to 10 people , while the share of \n\nemployees working onsite and the capacity limit f or larger events was increased to 75%, from \n\nthe earlier 50%. These restrictions were fully lifted from end -April. Nightlife businesses we re \n\nalso allowed to re open from mid -April, after more than two years of closure . In addition, a new \n\nand simplified travel scheme, the Vaccinated Travel Framework, replaced the Vaccinated \n\nTravel Lane s scheme , with most restrictions lifted for fully vaccinated travellers to Singapore. \n\nThese measures should bring forward the projected recovery in the domestic -oriented and \n\ntravel -related sectors to Q2 , instead of the latter part of 2022 , as projected previously .\n\nNevertheless , the travel -related clusters are not expected to fully recoup their pandemic \n\nlosses in the near term, as the un certainty from the Russia -Ukraine conflict and spike s in \n\nprices could weigh on consumer sentiment . Further, there is a risk of a structural decline in \n\nbusiness travel . The a ccommodation sector could take time to recover fully as tourists ,\n\nparticularly from countries in the region whose vaccination rates are low er , return only \n\ngradually , even as domestic demand for staycations wane s. To speed up the recovery in the \n\ntourism sector and capture pent -up travel demand , the government has earmarked nearly \n\n$500 million in various initiatives to attract visitors to Singapore . Th ese include curating and \n\ncreating attractions and events with a sustainability and wellness focus, as well as defending \n\nSingapore’s position as a “Global -Asia” node for business tourism. For example, Singapore \n\nrecently hosted the Singapore International Water Week and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore \n\nand , in the coming months, will host other large -scale M ICE events, such as Asia Tech x \n\nSingapore , Food&HotelAsia and Design Fair Asia .\n\nSectoral growth drivers will broaden in 2022, with overall GDP growth \n\nexpected to come in at 3 –5% \n\nAll in, G DP growth is projected at 3 –5% in 2022, in the absence of further disruptions \n\ncaused by the war in Ukraine or a severe worsening of the pandemic . The projected growth \n\noutcome represents a moderati on from the 7.6% expansion in 2021 , but would still be above \n\ntrend for the second consecutive year . The drivers of growth shou ld broaden to the domestic -\n\noriented and travel -related clusters over the course of this year, with the substantial easing of \n\ndomestic safe management measures and border restrictions. Accordingly, sectors which \n\nbore the brunt of the pandemic are projected to stage a more decisive recovery and contribute \n\nmore significantly to GDP growth in 2022 compared to last year . The trade -related cluster, \n\nwhich led the recovery in 2021 , could see its contribution shrink this year , while the \n\ncontribution of modern services is expected to be stable. By the end of 2022, output levels in \n\nsome segment s of the economy are still expected to remain below pre -pandemic levels ,\n\nal though th ey would be significantly above their respective trough s. T hese includ e the travel -\n\nrelated industries of air transport, accommodation and AER, as well as the domestic -oriented \n\nindustries such as land transport, construction and administrati ve & support services .The Singapore Economy 39 \n\n# 2.3 The Next Phase of Economic Restructuring in \n\n# Singapore \n\nSingapore’s restructuring journey in the last decade has led to productivity -\n\ndriven growth \n\nThe E conomic Strategies Committee (ESC) was formed in 2009 to develop strategies for \n\nSingapore to achieve sustained and inclusive growth . One of the key recommendations was \n\na shift from a labour -driven to a productivity -driven growth model . A productivity growth target \n\nwas set at 2–3% per annum , which would in turn support annual economic growth of 3 –5%.\n\nIn the course of this restructuring journey , the economy was expected to experienc e several \n\nphases of adjustment s (Fig ure 2. 3). In the initial cost -adjustment phase (2011 –13), nominal \n\nwages would rise strongly, with CPI inflation stay ing above its historical average, reflecting \n\ntight labour market conditions , even as real GDP beg an to slow. In the consolidation phase \n\n(2014 –16), GDP growth would slow discernibly while wage growth remained elevated. The \n\nsteep rise in business costs could have caused some unproductive firms to consolidate or \n\nwind down their businesses in Singapore. In the recovery phase (2017 –19), there would be a\n\nnotable improvement in productivity (measured in terms of real VA per paid hour worked) ,\n\nand cost pressures were expected to ease. GDP growth was projected to pick up at the end \n\nof the decade. \n\nOverall, the macroeconomic outcomes have been broadly in line with the path that had \n\nbeen envisaged (Table 2.7 ). From 2011 to 2019, GDP growth took a step down from the \n\nprevious decade and became increasingly driven by productivity improvements. However, CPI \n\ninflation was capped in the latter half of the decade , in part due to the weakness in global oil \n\nprices. With inflation ed ging down and n ominal wage growth pick ing up, there was a rise in \n\nreal wage growth. \n\nFigure 2. 3 The 2010s saw three distinct phases of macroeconomic transition                           \n\n> Stylised profile of real GDP and CPI levels\n> Source: EPG, MAS estimates\n> Note: This chart depicts a stylised profile of the path of GDP and CPI over the transition period in comparison to abaseline\n> scenario envisaged in 2011 .2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n> CPI\n> GDP\n> Consolidation\n> Phase\n> Recovery\n> •Limited impact\n> on growth\n> •Mounting price\n> pressures\n> •Peak price pressures\n> •Unproductive firms\n> consolidate in the face\n> of higher business costs\n> •GDP growth\n> improves\n> •Price pressures\n> ease\n> Cost -adjustment\n> Phase\n\n40 Macroeconomic Review | April 2022 \n\nTable 2. 7 Productivity improve d following a period of transition  \n\n> Average annual change in key macroeconomic variables\n\n% YOY  2001 –10  Cost -adjustment \n\n(2011 –13) \n\nConsolidation \n\n(2014 –16) \n\nRecovery \n\n(2017 –19)  2011 –19 \n\nReal GDP  5.9  5.2  3.5  3.1  3.9 \n\nNominal wages  3.3  5.2  4.3  4.1  4.5 \n\nCPI -All items inflation  1.6  4.1  0.0  0.5  1.5 \n\nMAS Core Inflation  1.7  2.1  1.1  1.4  1.6 \n\nReal VA per paid hour worked  2.3  1.2  1.7  3.0  2.0 \n\nContribution of productivity to \n\nreal GDP growth  39%  23%  48%  97%  50%    \n\n> Source: DOS, MOM and EPG, MAS estimates\n> Note: Real VA per paid hour worked is computed using real VA per worker and average weekly total paid hours worked per\n> employee .\n\nThe overall transformation has been accompanied by widening divergence \n\nbetween the tradable and non -tradable sectors since the mid -2010s \n\nThe strong growth in overall wages and productivity during the recovery phase masked \n\nsectoral disparities within the Singapore economy .

Consequently, the VA share of the tr adable \n\nsector in the economy increased to 7 3% by 202 1, from around 65% in the mid -2010s (Chart \n\n2. 16 ). At the industry level, sectors involved in export activity, such as manufacturing, finan ce\n\n& insurance , information & communication s and professional services , recorded stronger VA \n\ngrowth on average over 2017 to 2019, compared to the domestic -facing secto rs such as retail \n\ntrade and F&B services (Chart 2. 17 ).        \n\n> 10 The tradable sector scomprise manufacturing, wholesale trade, transportation & storage, financ e & insurance , information\n> & communications, professional services and accommodation .

According to th e Samuelson -Balassa \n\nhypothesis , countries with high productivity in the tradable sector tend to have higher overall \n\nprice level s, compared to countries with lower productivity . High productivity in the tradable \n\nsector should lead to high wag es in the tradable sector . I f labour markets are competitive ,\n\nlabour will reallocate to the tradable sector a s workers move into the high -wage industries .\n\nThis leads to scarcity of labour in the non -tradable sector, bidding up wages there. As wages \n\nin the non -tradable sector rise, output prices in the sector increase , driving up overall price \n\nlevels correspondingly. \n\nChart 2.21 Productivity in Singapore’s tradable sector has exceeded that of most OECD countries   \n\n> Tradable sector labour productivity (GVA per worker), 2019\n> Source: OECD\n\nEmpirical studies provide robust support for the validity of the Samuelson -Balassa \n\nhypothesis. Countries with high productivity in the tradable sector tend to have high wages \n\nand prices in the non -tradable sector compared to countries with lower productivity . However, \n\nthis phenomenon generally did not occur in Singapore , with wages and prices in the non -\n\ntradable sector remaining substantially lower than those in the tradable sector . Th e\n\ndivergence could be attributed to the abundant supply of foreign workers in the non -tradable \n\nsector, including in many domestic -oriented services , which  has impeded the working of the \n\nSamuelson -Balassa transmission mechanism by dampen ing wage and price increases in the \n\nnon -tradable sector. 0\n\n> 30\n> 60\n> 90\n> 120\n> 150\n> 180\n> US$ Thousand\n\nThe Singapore Economy 45 \n\nLower - and m iddle -income households sh ould benefit from larger wage \n\nincreases in the next phase of restructuring \n\nIn t he next phase of Singapore’s restructuring , the wage gap between the tradable and \n\nnon -tradable sectors is likely to narrow, driven by market forces and government polic ies .\n\nFirst, as growth in the resident labour force slow s compared with the past decade , the \n\nresident workforce in the non -tradable sector is proj ected to grow at a slower rate than that \n\nin the tradable sector, reflecting residents’ preference for working in the latter, particular ly in \n\nmodern services. Second, w ith foreign worker policy likely to remain tight especially at the \n\nlower end of the skill s spectrum , the constraints posed by resident labour supply should \n\nbe come more binding, thereby lift ing wages in the non -tradable sector and reduc ing the wage \n\ngap. Finally , ongoing government policies , such as the expanded Progressive Wage Model to \n\nraise incomes for low -wage workers , will also help to support non -tradable sector wages. \n\nThere would be important distributional gains from this transition. 11 Based on EPG \n\nestimates, l ower - and middle -incom e households will likely see the largest increases in real \n\nwages, as the boost to their nominal employment incomes outweigh s higher non -tradable \n\nprices in their consumption baskets . A larger proportion of lower -income workers are \n\nemployed in the non -tradable sector s, such as F&B and accommodation services (Chart 2.22 ),\n\nthat would see relatively large wage increases during the transition . In comparison, higher -\n\nincome households may see relatively small increases in nominal income, as business \n\nincome and employment income from the tradable sector account for relatively large shares \n\nof their total income .\n\nChart 2.22 With a higher proportion of lower -income workers employed in non -tradable sectors, lower -\n\nand middle -income households cou ld see larger distributional gains                       \n\n> Share of workers in tradable and non -tradable sectors by gross monthly income from work bands, June 2017\n> Source: MOM and EPG, MAS estimates\n> Note: Data excludes employer CPF contribution s.\n> 11 The results are based on EPG’s estimation through merging data from MOM’s\n> Comprehensive Labour Force Survey , June\n> 2017 and Department of Statistics’\n> Household Expenditure Survey 2017/18. 0\n> 20\n> 40\n> 60\n> 80\n> 100\n> Per Cent\n> Tradable Non-tradable 46 Macroeconomic Review |April 2022\n\nIn summary , the restructuring of the Singapore economy over the past decade has \n\nyielded greater producti vi ty gains in the tradable sector. Spillovers to the non -tradable sector \n\nhave been weak er than expected , resulting in a persistent wage gap between the two sectors. \n\nThi s wedge will likely narrow in t he next phase of Singapore’s restructuring journey , due to a\n\ncombination of market forces and government polic ies. While it will entail a temporary period \n\nof adjustment in the form of higher business costs , the eventual rise in productivity in the non -\n\ntradable sector should help to offset these pressures. Lower - and m iddle -income households \n\nwould also benefit the most from this transition through an increase in their real incomes .\n",

Administration](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/images/BlackWhite-bungalow.jpg)\n\nIn land scarce Singapore, optimising the use of land resources is integral to sustaining Singapore’s economic and social growth.\n\nMinLaw formulates and reviews the following policies to support the optimal use of land resources:\n\n*   **Residential Property Act**\n    *   The [Residential Property Act (RPA)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/RPA1976) strikes a balance between ensuring that the limited supply of landed residential properties in Singapore remains the primary preserve of Singapore Citizens, whilst allowing selected foreigners who have demonstrated social commitment and are making a significant economic contribution to Singapore to also own landed homes. Foreigners who wish to purchase landed residential properties have to submit an application to the Land Dealings Approval Unit at the [Singapore Land Authority (SLA)](https://www1.sla.gov.sg/).\n    *   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to [purchase of landed residential property by foreigners under the RPA.](http://www.ifaq.gov.sg/sla/mobile/index.aspx#Docs/9005)\n\n*   **Land Acquisition Act**\n    *   The [Land Acquisition Act (LAA)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/LAA1966) is a key legislation that enables the compulsory acquisition of private land for public purposes, such as the building of transportation infrastructure and public housing. Landowners whose lands are acquired are paid market value compensation under the LAA. \n\n*   **Land Titles (Strata) Act**\n    *   The sale of private strata developments in en bloc sales, or collective sales, facilitates redevelopment and supports urban rejuvenation. The requirements and procedures for an en bloc sale by majority consent are governed by the [Land Titles (Strata) Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/LTSA1967).\n    *   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to [collective sale](https://www.stratatb.gov.sg/faq-ltsa.html#/).\n\nMinLaw is also the guardian of State land. Its Statutory Board, the [Singapore Land Authority (SLA)](https://www.sla.gov.sg/), manages approximately 11,000 hectares of State land and 5,000 State buildings.\n\nSLA provides the following land administration services:\n\n*   **Selling and leasing land to the public and private sector, and allocating land to support national development**\n    *   The SLA facilitates the sale and leasing of State land to both the public and private sectors for various uses, such as public housing, industrial development, community uses. The integrity of the land allocation and administration process is critical to meet ever-changing socio-economic needs, and to maintain confidence in land transactions. \n\n*   **Registration of land and property transactions and the issuance and guarantee of land titles in Singapore**\n    *   Land rights are of vital social and economic importance, because they form the basis on which many economic and business activities can take place. The high level of home and property ownership in Singapore also necessitates a secure land titles registration system. Land titles records are maintained by the SLA, the national land registration authority for property transactions and the issuance and guarantee of land titles in Singapore.\n\n*   **Managing and collating digitised information on Singapore's roads and MRT networks, property boundaries, outlines of public housing and industrial buildings**\n    *   SLA makes available information to the public through the following services:\n    *   [OneMap](https://www.onemap.sg/main/v2/)\n\n OneMap is an integrated online geospatial platform that provides reliable, timely and accurate location-based information and services to the public. Use OneMap for street directory information as well as services such as LandQuery, SchoolQuery and PopulationQuery, amongst others.\n    *   [Integrated Land Information Service (INLIS)](https://app1.sla.gov.sg/inlis/#/)\n\n Use this one-stop internet portal which provides information on land matters such as road line plans, survey plans and property boundaries. In addition, INLIS provides information on property such as ownership of property, property transaction history and surrounding amenities.\n\n*   **Maintaining the national land survey system**\n    *   SLA administers the national land survey system which provides the fundamental information about land in Singapore. It establishes and maintains geodetic reference system and infrastructure to support all land survey and geospatial activities. SLA regulates the process of property boundaries survey (known as the cadastral survey), which is now based on co-ordinates. The [Land Surveyors Board](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/lsb/en.html) provides for the registration of surveyors. It is also responsible for setting and maintaining standards for registered surveyors, and regulating and advancing the practice of land surveying in Singapore.\n\n**Video: Land Policy and

To promote resilient and sustainable economic development, we have adopted an open economy conducive to foreign investments and international trade since our independence in 1965. This has allowed\n    us to transform from a third world economy into a global business hub over the years, with substantive activities across diverse sectors.\nLocated at the crossroads between the East and West, Singapore is an attractive location for global businesses to access new and emerging markets in Asia. With our excellent infrastructure, robust and transparent regulatory environment, political stability,\n    skilled workforce, and a stable and efficient tax regime, Singapore has become a trusted hub for many businesses, with manufacturing being one of the largest sectors in our economy. Our Corporate Income Tax system has features that encourage enterprise,\n    growth, and internationalisation.\nStart-up Tax Exemption Scheme\nIncome derived by companies in Singapore is taxed at a flat rate of 17%. The start-up tax exemption scheme encourages entrepreneurship by providing newly incorporated companies some exemption on their taxable profits in their first three years of operation.\n    Please refer to\n    IRAS’ website for more details on the\nstart-up tax exemption\n    scheme and the qualifying conditions (https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-rate-rebates-and-tax-exemption-schemes)\n.\nPartial Tax Exemption Scheme\nThe Government recognises that small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are an important component of a vibrant economy. To help such companies grow and establish themselves, the Government has put in place a partial tax exemption scheme designed to\n    support SMEs. Please refer to IRAS' website for more details on the\npartial tax exemption scheme (https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-rate-rebates-and-tax-exemption-schemes)\n.\nGroup Relief\nAs companies grow and expand their operations, they may organise themselves as multiple holding companies, subsidiaries and associate companies to manage liabilities. Under Singapore’s group relief system, current year unutilised losses, donations\n    and unabsorbed capital allowances may be transferred to related companies within the group. This reduces the overall tax burden for the whole group. Please refer to IRAS' website for more details on the\ngroup relief system (https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-reliefs/group-relief)\n.\nMergers & Acquisitions (“M&A”)  Scheme\nThe M&A scheme aims to facilitate mergers and acquisitions, with a focus on developing a vibrant and dynamic SME sector. Please refer to IRAS' website for further details of the\nM&A scheme and qualifying criteria (https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-allowances/mergers-acquisitions-(m-a)-allowance)\n.\nDouble Tax Deduction for Internationalisation Scheme\nThe Double Tax Deduction for Internationalisation (“DTDi”) scheme provides support to businesses as they venture into international markets.

Companies may qualify for foreign tax credit to offset the taxes payable on foreign-sourced income. To allow businesses\n    to claim foreign tax credit in a more administratively efficient manner, the Government has introduced the foreign-sourced income exemption (FSIE) regime.\nConditions to be met\nUnder the FSIE regime, foreign-sourced dividends, branch profits and service income (collectively \"specified foreign-sourced income\") derived by any person who is a tax resident in Singapore is exempted from tax if the following conditions are met:\nthe specified foreign-sourced income has been subjected to tax in the foreign jurisdiction from which the income is received;\nthe headline tax rate of the foreign jurisdiction from which the specified foreign-sourced income is received is at least 15% at the time the foreign income is received in Singapore; and\nthe Comptroller of Income Tax is satisfied that the tax exemption would be beneficial to the person resident in Singapore.\nWhat if the conditions are not met?\nWhere the above general conditions are not met, tax exemption may be granted under section 13(12) of the Income Tax Act, for foreign-sourced income under the scenarios specified in the IRAS e-tax guide on “\nIncome Tax: Tax Exemption\n    under Section 13(12) for Specified Scenarios, Real Estate Investment Trusts and Qualifying Offshore Infrastructure Project/Asset (https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/e-tax-guides?taxtype=&industries=&topics=&years=&keyword=section%2013(12)&sort=datedesc&page=1&pg=1&taxtypes=Corporate%2BIncome%2BTax)\n”.\nThe  declaration form to avail of section 13(12) tax exemption under the specified scenarios is in the IRAS e-tax guide.\nOtherwise, any exemption may only be granted on a case-by-case basis, upon application. The application form can be found\nhere (https://www.mof.gov.sg/schemes/businesses)\n.\nPlease refer to IRAS' website for more information on the\nFSIE regime (https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income)\n.\nWhat is Foreign Tax Credit Pooling?\nForeign Tax Credit Pooling was introduced in 2011 to give businesses greater flexibility on their claims for foreign tax credit.\nWhat conditions must be met?\nTo claim Foreign Tax Credit Pooling, the following conditions must be met:\nincome tax is paid on the income in the foreign jurisdiction from which the income is derived;\nthe headline tax rate of the foreign jurisdiction from which the income is received is at least 15% at the time the foreign income is received in Singapore; and\nthere is Singapore income tax payable on the foreign income and the taxpayer is entitled to claim for foreign tax credit under the Income Tax Act.\nPlease refer to IRAS' website for more details on the\nForeign Tax Credit Pooling system (https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-reliefs/foreign-tax-credit)\n.\nTax Incentives\nSingapore uses tax incentives as one of the tools to encourage new and high-growth activities. Tax incentives are legislated and reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant.\nTax incentives are administered by Singapore’s economic agencies. The incentives are granted for a limited period to businesses that conduct substantive activities or have substantive business plans to establish or expand their operations in Singapore,\n    for income arising from qualifying activities. Income arising from non-qualifying activities will be taxed at the Corporate Income Tax rate. Read more on\ntax incentives (https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/applying-for-tax-incentives)\non IRAS’ website\nIncentive recipients are:\nrequired to significantly contribute to the deepening of activities and/or creation of new capabilities and high-value skilled employment in Singapore; and\nsubject to regular reviews of their economic contributions for the qualifying activities.\nAn incentive recipient needs to meet the committed contributions to continue enjoying its incentive award.\nTax Deduction for Donations\nTo continue encouraging Singaporeans to give back to the community and to provide strong support for the charity sector, the Minister for Finance announced in Budget 2023 that 250% tax\n    deductions for qualifying donations will be extended for another three years until 31 December 2026.\nTable 1 below further elaborates on the types of donations that will be granted the 250% tax deduction.\nTable 1: Qualifying Donations for 250% Tax Deductions\nDonation Scheme\nEligible Recipient\nEligible Donor\nCash donations for local causes\nInstitutions of Public Character (IPCs) and the Singapore Government\nAll donors\nGift of shares listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) or of units in unit trusts traded in Singapore\nIPCs\nIndividual donors only\nGifts of artefacts\nApproved museums by the National Heritage Board (NHB)\nAll donors\nDonation of public sculptures\nNHB or NHB-approved recipients\nAll donors\nGifts of parcels of land or buildings\nIPCs\nAll donors\nIn addition, from 1 Jan 2005, the following donations with naming opportunities will be granted the 250% tax deduction::\nDonations to name IPCs, IPC facilities, events or programmes,\nDonations to name facilities of approved beneficiaries (including artefacts and public sculptures) under any of the other approved donation programmes,\nDonations under any of the approved donation programme where the IPC or approved beneficiary acknowledges the donation by including the donor's name or logo in the IPC's collaterals (e.g. banners, publications, advertisements).\nThe 250% tax deduction will not be given in cases where the donor is  advertising at the IPC facility, event or programme. Donors displaying their banners, products, or other collaterals at the IPC facility, event, or programme to which it\n    has donated is regarded as advertising or marketing expenses and not a donation.\nOther forms of in-kind donations that do not fall under Table 1 or are not eligible naming opportunities as indicated above will not be awarded the 250% tax deduction.\nTax deductions for overseas donations\nTo encourage greater philanthropic giving among Single Family Offices and the growth of philanthropic capabilities in Singapore, the Minister for Finance introduced the Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme for Family\nOffices (PTIS) at Budget 2023. Qualifying donors approved under the PTIS can claim 100% tax deduction for overseas donations made through qualifying local intermediaries for a period of five years starting from an approved incentive commencement date\nwithin the period 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2028.

Through this movement, the skills, passion and contributions of every individual will drive Singapore's next phase of development towards an advanced economy and inclusive society.\n\nInvestment in human capital through education and training has been at the heart of Singapore’s progress, and has also helped Singaporeans develop and maximise their potential. By enabling a highly-skilled and competitive workforce, it has allowed Singaporeans to secure better jobs, higher incomes and enjoy higher standards of living.\n\nContinuous education and training remain core to our society and economy today and for the future. With the fast pace of technological advancements and stronger global competition for jobs, skills upgrading and deepening are essential for Singaporeans to maintain a competitive edge.\n\nAs our economy restructures and companies find ways to innovate and enhance productivity, the demand for higher-skilled workers will also increase.\n\nGiven these trends, the workplace must be a major site of learning, where every Singaporean is able to continue to develop themselves throughout their careers and through life.\n\nThe tripartite SkillsFuture Council, led by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, will coordinate and drive a national effort to help Singaporeans develop skills relevant to the future, and build a future based on the mastery of skills in every job. SkillsFuture encapsulates the impetus for Singapore to move towards an advanced economy and society, where individuals go beyond competence to attaining expertise and mastery of skills, motivated not just by current demands of their job but by a dedication to excellence and passion in each individual’s own area of strength and interest. It also embodies the spirit of lifelong learning, respect for skills in every job, and celebrating the skills and growth of every individual, no matter their background, age or qualifications.\n\nFour key areas of focus under the SkillsFuture Council are:\n\n1.   Helping individuals make well-informed choices in education, training and careers.\n2.   Developing an integrated, high-quality system of education and training that responds to constantly evolving industry needs.\n3.   Promoting employer recognition and career development based on skills and mastery.\n4.   Fostering a culture that supports and celebrates lifelong learning.\n\nIn line with SkillsFuture, the Ministry of Manpower, together with Workforce Singapore, the Ministry of Education and other economic agencies in government, are developing an integrated system of education and training to provide all Singaporeans with the enhanced opportunities to acquire greater skills proficiency, knowledge and expertise.\n\nFor continuing education and training (CET), workers can sign up for programmes and courses under the Singapore Workforce Qualifications System (WSQ) to upgrade their skills and enhance their employability.\n\nFor more info, please visit the [SkillsFuture website](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/).\n",

Growth during the quarter was due to increases in both external and domestic demand. For 2024 as a whole, total demand increased by 5.9 per cent, strengthening from the 3.8 per cent growth in 2023. The increase in total demand was supported by a rise in both external demand (4.0 percentage-points) and domestic demand (1.8 percentage-points). \n\nExternal Demand \n\nExternal demand rose by 3.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, easing from the 4.4 per cent expansion in the previous quarter (Exhibit 1.6). The rise in external demand could be attributed to an increase in the real exports of goods, even as the real exports of services fell. For the full year, external demand expanded by 5.4 per cent, slightly slower than the 5.7 per cent expansion in 2023. The increase in external demand could be attributed to increases in both real merchandise and services exports. In turn, these were led by higher real exports of machinery & transport equipment and financial services respectively. \n\nDomestic Demand \n\nTotal domestic demand rose by 8.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, faster than the 7.6 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. The increase in domestic demand during the quarter was due to increases in inventories, consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation. For 2024 as a whole, total domestic demand rose by 7.2 per cent, a rebound from the 2.2 per cent contraction in 2023. The rise in domestic demand was due to increases in consumption expenditure, inventories and gross fixed capital formation. \n\nConsumption Expenditure \n\nTotal consumption expenditure rose by 5.3 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, slower than the 6.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter. For the full year, total consumption expenditure rose by 5.7 per cent, faster than the 4.1 per cent growth in 2023. Consumption expenditure growth was due to both private and public consumption. Private consumption rose by 4.8 per cent, led by increases in transport, health and miscellaneous goods & services. At the same time, public consumption rose by 8.3 per cent, accelerating from the 1.8 per cent expansion in 2023.

GFCF rose during the quarter on account of increases in public GFCF (10.8 per cent) and private GFCF (3.6 per cent). For the full year, GFCF rose by 2.9 per cent, a turnaround from the 0.9 per cent contraction in 2023 (Exhibit 1.7). Private GFCF increased by 0.8 per cent, a reversal from the 1.7 per cent contraction in 2023, mainly due to higher investment spending on intellectual property products (Exhibit 1.8). Meanwhile, public GFCF rose by 12.4 per cent, accelerating from the 3.1 per cent expansion in 2023. The increase in public GFCF was due to higher investment spending across all components. \n\n## INCOME COMPONENTS OF NOMINAL GDP \n\nSingapore’s nominal GDP amounted to $731 billion in 2024, a 7.8 per cent increase over 2023. Gross operating surplus accounted for 54.9 per cent of nominal GDP, while compensation of employees accounted for 37.8 per cent (Exhibit 1.9). Taxes (less subsidies) on production and imports made up the remaining 7.3 per cent of nominal GDP. \n\n## NATIONAL SAVING \n\nWith factor income outflows exceeding inflows by $119 billion, Gross National Income (GNI) came in at $613 billion in 2024, lower than the $731 billion in nominal GDP. Gross National Saving (GNS) increased by 10.0 per cent to $291 billion in 2024. This comprised a net outflow of $128 billion that was lent or transferred abroad, and $162 billion in Gross Capital Formation. The national savings rate was 47.5 per cent of GNI in 2024, slightly lower than the 47.7 per cent in 2023. \n\nTotal Public Private Total 2.9 2.3 0.6 \n\nConstruction & Works 1.4 1.9 -0.5 \n\nTransport Equipment 0.5 0.0 0.4 \n\nMachinery & Equipment 0.5 0.3 0.2 \n\nIntellectual Property Products 0.6 0.0 0.6 Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n10 Exhibit 1.10: Singapore’s Earnings from External Economy as a Proportion of Total Income \n\n0510 15 20 25 30 \n\n2024 2019 2014 2009 2004 \n\n> Per Cent Factor Income From Abroad (FIFA) GDP + FIFA\n\n## GNI AND THE EXTERNAL ECONOMY \n\nFactor income from abroad reached $267 billion in 2024, up from the $221 billion in 2023.

Likewise, total employment growth excluding MDWs was slower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. By broad sectors, employment rose in the services (+8,500), construction (+4,300) and manufacturing (+700) sectors in the fourth quarter. Across the services sectors, employment gains were the largest in the other services and professional services sectors (Exhibit 2.2). \n\nExhibit 2.1: Changes in Total Employment Exhibit 2.2: Changes in Employment by Industry in 4Q 2024      \n\n> 010 20 30\n> IV III II IIV\n> Thousand\n> 2023 2024\n> Thousand\n> -5 0510\n> Transportation & Storage\n> Food & Beverage Information & Comms Accommodation Administrative & Support Finance & Insurance Manufacturing Retail Trade Wholesale Trade Real Estate Professional Services Construction Other Services Industries\n> -1.3 -1.2 -0.9 -0.1 0.7 1.6 2.4 4.3 6.8 1.0 0.9 0.7 -1.4\n> 1Figures for the fourth quarter of 2024 and full year of 2024 are preliminary estimates.\n\n# OVERVIEW 1\n\nTotal employment grew by 60,700 in 2024, driven by gains in both resident and non-resident employment. By broad sectors, the services and construction sectors saw employment gains, while employment contracted in the manufacturing sector. Excluding Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs), total employment grew by 45,500. At the same time, unemployment rates remained stable and low, while the number of retrenchments fell in 2024. Between 2019 and 2024, the real gross monthly income of full-time employed residents at the median and 20th percentile grew by 0.7 per cent per annum and 1.2 per cent per annum, respectively. Chapter 2: Labour Market and Productivity \n\n15 Exhibit 2.3: Unemployment Rates (Seasonally-Adjusted)    \n\n> Per Cent\n> 2023 2024 01234\n> Dec Sep Jun Mar Dec\n> Overall Resident Citizen\n\nFor the whole of 2024, total employment expanded by 60,700, moderating from the 96,700 increase in 2023. Across the broad sectors, employment gains were registered in the services (+50,900) and construction (+11,300) sectors, while the manufacturing (-500) sector posted a decline. Resident employment growth in 2024 is expected to be higher than in 2023, when resident employment declined. In contrast, non-resident employment growth in 2024 is expected to slow considerably from 2023. 2\n\n## UNEMPLOYMENT \n\nBetween September and December 2024, the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate at the overall level was unchanged (1.9 per cent), while the resident and citizen unemployment rates rose marginally, from 2.6 per cent to 2.8 per cent and from 2.7 per cent to 2.9 per cent respectively (Exhibit 2.3). In December 2024, there were 67,500 unemployed residents, of whom 59,700 were Singapore citizens. This was an increase from the 62,500 and 54,900 unemployed residents and Singapore citizens in September 2024, respectively. For the full year of 2024, the annual average unemployment rate increased slightly at the overall level (from 1.9 per cent in 2023 to 2.0 per cent), as well as for residents (from 2.7 per cent to 2.8 per cent), but was unchanged for citizens (2.9 per cent). In 2024, 67,600 residents, of whom 59,300 were Singapore citizens, were unemployed. These were marginally higher than their respective figures in 2023 (65,700 and 58,200). \n\n## RETRENCHMENTS \n\nThe number of retrenchments rose in the fourth quarter (3,600), compared to the third quarter (3,050). Over the quarter, the increase in retrenchments in the services (from 2,220 to 2,800) and manufacturing (from 580 to 700) sectors outweighed the decline in retrenchments in the construction (from 140 to 100) sector. The total number of retrenchments for 2024 (12,930) fell from the 14,590 retrenchments registered in 2023. The number of retrenchments fell across all broad sectors, led by the manufacturing (from 3,470 to 2,630) sector, followed by the services sectors collectively (from 10,440 to 9,720) and the construction (from 590 to 460) sector.  \n\n> 2Further details of the breakdown of employment growth in the fourth quarter and full year for 2024, including by resident status, will be released by MOM in the Labour Market Report Fourth Quarter 2024 in mid-March 2025. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024\n\n16 3 Outward-oriented sectors refer to manufacturing, wholesale trade, transportation & storage, accommodation, information & communications, finance & insurance and professional services. Domestically-oriented sectors refer to construction, retail trade, food & beverage services, real estate, administrative & support services and other services industries. \n\nExhibit 2.4: Changes in Value-Added per Actual Hour Worked for the Overall Economy Exhibit 2.5: Changes in Value-Added per Actual Hour Worked by Industry in 2024     \n\n> -4 -2 02468\n> 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020\n> Per Cent\n> Per Cent\n> -5 0510 15\n> Administrative & Support Real Estate Other Services Industries Retail Trade Food & Beverage Services Professional Services Construction Overall Productivity Finance & Insurance Accommodation Wholesale Trade Manufacturing Transportation & Storage Information & Comms\n> -0.5 1.1 1.4 3.0 3.6 5.0 5.5 6.4 10.5 -2.3 6.1 5.1 1.9 -0.9\n\n## PRODUCTIVITY \n\nReal Value-Added per Actual Hour Worked \n\nOverall labour productivity, as measured by real value-added per actual hour worked, rose by 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, extending the 4.5 per cent increase in the previous quarter. By sectors, the productivity of the wholesale trade, manufacturing, information & communications, construction, real estate, accommodation, transportation & storage, finance & insurance and food & beverage services sectors rose in the fourth quarter. By contrast, the productivity of the administrative & support services, professional services, other services and retail trade sectors fell. Collectively, the productivity of outward-oriented sectors increased by 4.8 per cent in the fourth quarter, while that of domestically-oriented sectors rose by 0.3 per cent over the same period. 3For the full year, real value-added per actual hour worked grew by 3.6 per cent, reversing the 1.5 per cent decline in 2023 (Exhibit 2.4). The productivity performance for the overall economy was supported by productivity improvements across most sectors, with the information & communications sector experiencing the largest gains in productivity. By contrast, productivity fell in the administrative & support services, real estate and other services sectors (Exhibit 2.5). \n\nReal Value-Added per Worker \n\nReal value-added per worker rose by 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, continuing the 4.2 per cent increase in the preceding quarter. For 2024, real value-added per worker rose by 2.7 per cent, reversing the decline of 2.7 per cent in 2023. The weaker performance of real value-added per worker compared to real value-added per actual hour worked in 2024 was because of a decline in the average number of actual hours worked per worker during the year.

Median nominal gross monthly income (including employer CPF contributions) of full-time employed residents grew by 5.8 per cent to $5,500, an increase from the 2.5 per cent growth in 2023. After adjusting for inflation 4, real median income rose by 3.4 per cent in 2024. Lower-income earners also saw an increase in their incomes after taking inflation into account, with real income at the 20th percentile growing by 4.6 per cent in 2024. With WIS and related payments included, real income at the 20th percentile saw a smaller increase (4.0 per cent). Over the last five years (i.e., June 2019 to June 2024), real median income rose by 0.7 per cent per annum (Exhibit 2.6). During this period, real income growth at the 20th percentile was stronger (1.2 per cent per annum), thus narrowing the income gap with the median income earner.  \n\n> 4The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items rose by 2.4 per cent in 2024.

The pickup in overall ULC during the quarter came on the back of an increase in total labour cost per worker that outpaced the rise in labour productivity (as measured by real value-added per worker). By broad sectors, the ULC of services producing industries rose by 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, faster than the 1.2 per cent increase in the previous quarter. Most services sectors saw a pickup in their ULCs, with the food & beverage services sector registering the largest increase (8.0 per cent) on account of an increase in total labour cost per worker and a decline in labour productivity. Meanwhile, the construction sector registered a ULC increase of 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, a reversal from the 0.1 per cent decrease in the previous quarter. The increase in ULC in the construction sector was due to an increase in total labour cost per worker which outpaced an increase in labour productivity. The ULC for the manufacturing sector fell by 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, following the 8.1 per cent decline in the third quarter. This decline was due to an increase in labour productivity, which more than offset an increase in total labour cost per worker. For the whole of 2024, the overall ULC rose at a slower pace of 1.2 per cent, compared to the 6.5 per cent increase in 2023. The rise in overall ULC was due to an increase in total labour cost per worker that outpaced labour productivity gains. \n\nExhibit 3.1: Changes in Unit Labour Cost in 4Q 2024    \n\n> Per Cent\n> 8.0 7.5 6.4 5.0 1.6 -1.9 1.0 -2.2 -2.8 3.6 2.7 5.8 1.3 -2.8 -5 0510\n> Transportation & Storage Information & Comms Wholesale Trade Manufacturing Overall Economy Construction Real Estate Finance & Insurance Accommodation Professional Services Retail Trade Other Services Industries Administrative & Support Food & Beverage\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nOverall ULC for the economy rose by 1.0 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, reversing the decline of 0.4 per cent in the preceding quarter. For the whole of 2024, overall ULC rose by 1.2 per cent. Total investment commitments attracted by EDB remained healthy in 2024. The manufacturing sector garnered a larger amount of commitments in terms of fixed asset investments (FAI) than the services sector, while the latter attracted a larger amount of total business expenditure (TBE) commitments. By clusters, the electronics and biomedical manufacturing clusters within the manufacturing sector were the biggest contributors to FAI commitments, while the headquarters & professional services cluster within the services sector contributed the most to TBE commitments. The Consumer Price Index-All Items (CPI-All Items) rose by 1.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, moderating from the 2.2 per cent increase in the previous quarter. For 2024 as a whole, CPI-All Items inflation came in at 2.4 per cent, lower than the 4.8 per cent recorded in 2023. Producer prices, as measured by the domestic supply price index (DSPI), the Singapore manufactured products price index (SMPPI) as well as the import and export price indices, fell on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. For the whole of 2024, the DSPI, SMPPI, as well as the import and export price indices decreased by 1.3 per cent, 0.5 per cent, 3.9 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively.

The decrease in manufacturing UBC came on the back of a decrease in unit services costs (-2.7 per cent) and manufacturing ULC (-1.9 per cent), which more than offset an increase in unit non-labour production taxes (33.9 per cent). For 2024 as a whole, manufacturing UBC increased by 0.2 per cent, moderating from the 5.8 per cent increase in 2023. \n\nExhibit 3.4: Fixed Asset Investments by Industry Clusters in 2024 \n\nSingapore’s relative unit labour cost (RULC) for manufacturing – a measure of Singapore’s labour cost competitiveness against 16 economies 1– fell in 2024 (i.e., more competitive) as compared to 2023 (Exhibit 3.3). The decline was mainly on account of a decrease in Singapore’s manufacturing ULC relative to its competitor economies, which outweighed the stronger Singapore dollar. \n\n## INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS \n\nEDB attracted healthy levels of investment commitments in 2024. For the full year, FAI and TBE commitments came in at $13.5 billion and $8.4 billion respectively. In terms of FAI, the largest contribution came from the manufacturing sector, which garnered $11.1 billion in commitments. Within manufacturing, the electronics cluster attracted the largest amount of FAI commitments, at $7.7 billion, followed by the biomedical manufacturing cluster, at $2.2 billion. Within the services sector, the headquarters & professional services and research & development clusters contributed the most to total FAI commitments, amounting to $1.1 billion each (Exhibit 3.4). Investors from the United States were the largest source of FAI commitments, with $7.5 billion (55.5 per cent). They were followed by investors from Europe who contributed about $3.3 billion of FAI commitments (24.8 per cent). For TBE, the services sector attracted the highest amount of commitments, at $6.5 billion. This was driven by the headquarters & professional services cluster, which garnered $5.3 billion in TBE commitments, followed by the research & development cluster, with $818 million. Among the manufacturing clusters, the electronics cluster contributed the highest amount of TBE commitments, at $662 million (Exhibit 3.5).   \n\n> Biomedical Manufacturing 16.5% 17.6% Services Clusters 57.0% Electronics 8.9% Others\n> 1The 16 economies are Australia, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam.

When these projects are fully implemented, they are expected to generate $23.5 billion of value-added per annum and create more than 18,700 jobs in the coming years. \n\n## CONSUMER PRICE INDEX \n\nSingapore’s CPI-All Items rose by 1.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter, moderating from the 2.2 per cent increase in the previous quarter (Exhibit 3.6). On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, CPI-All Items inflation came in at 0.2 per cent, edging down from the 0.3 per cent in the previous quarter. For 2024 as a whole, CPI-All Items inflation came in at 2.4 per cent, lower than the 4.8 per cent recorded in 2023. Price increases in the following CPI categories contributed positively to CPI-All Items inflation in 2024 (Exhibit 3.7). Healthcare costs climbed by 3.9 per cent on the back of more expensive outpatient and hospital services, as well as health insurance. Recreation & culture prices rose by 3.6 per cent due to increases in the costs of holiday travel and recreational & cultural services. Housing & utilities costs went up by 3.3 per cent as a result of higher accommodation costs. Education costs picked up by 3.2 per cent because of higher fees at commercial institutions, universities, childcare centres and kindergartens. Food prices increased by 2.8 per cent on account of the higher costs of food serving services such as hawker food and restaurant meals, as well as non-cooked food items such as bread & cereals and vegetables. Prices of miscellaneous goods & services increased by 1.4 per cent because of the higher prices of personal care items and alcoholic drinks & tobacco. Transport costs rose by 0.8 per cent as higher bus & train fares and more expensive point-to-point services and petrol more than offset lower car prices and airfares. Prices of household durables & services increased by 0.7 per cent on the back of more expensive domestic & household services. Communication costs edged up by 0.5 per cent due to the higher costs of telecommunication services. By contrast, clothing & footwear prices fell by 1.1 per cent ready-made garments and footwear became less expensive.

The declines during the quarter for DSPI and SMPPI came partly on the back of lower prices of mineral fuels and chemicals & chemical products. The import and export price indices fell in part due to cheaper mineral fuels and machinery & transport equipment. For the full year, the DSPI and SMPPI decreased by 1.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively, while the import and export price indices fell by 3.9 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively. The DSPI and SMPPI declined partly as a result of lower prices of mineral fuels and miscellaneous manufactured products. Meanwhile, the import and export price indices fell in part because of lower prices of machinery & transport equipment. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n26 BUSINESS COST CONDITIONS IN SINGAPORE’S MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES SECTORS \n\nIn 2024, unit business cost (UBC) in the manufacturing and services sectors rose. \n\nUBC for Manufacturing UBC for Services \n\n*Refers to the first three quarters of 2024 \n\n## 0.2% \n\nin 2024 5.8% \n\nin 2024* \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nThe increase in services UBC in 2024 came on the back of increases in both non-labour costs and unit labour cost. \n\nKEY DRIVERS \n\nFor 2025, the overall unit labour cost for the economy is likely to continue to rise at a pace that is broadly similar to that in 2024. Against the backdrop of rising global economic uncertainty, increases in remuneration per worker are likely to slow over the course of the year, even as productivity growth is expected to moderate in tandem with a slower pace of growth in the Singapore economy. At the same time, the costs of utilities, fuel and transportation are likely to moderate, in line with the outlook for global oil prices in 2025. \n\nOUTLOOK \n\nThe marginal increase in UBC for manufacturing in 2024 was due to the increase in the \"others\" cost component, which offset the declines in royalty payments, unit labour cost and the costs of work given out. \n\nCONTRIBUTION TO MANUFACTURING UBC IN 2024 CONTRIBUTION TO SERVICES UBC IN 2024 \n\nLabour Cost point +0.8% \n\nDEFINITION OF UBC \n\nTotal Business Cost Gross Real Value-Added UBC = Work Given Out point -0.2% Royalty Payments -0.6% point Others point +1.2% Labour Cost point -0.2% Non-Labour Cost +5.1% point Chapter 3: Costs, Investments and Prices \n\n27 \n\n# Box Article 3.1 -9 -6 -3 03691Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24 2023 2024 ULC Work Given Out Royalties Utilities Rental Others Unit Non-Labour Production Taxes Manufacturing UBC Contribution to YoY change, ppc \n\n## BOX 3.1: BUSINESS COST CONDITIONS IN SINGAPORE’S MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES SECTORS \n\nThis box article highlights the latest trends in business costs for firms in Singapore’s manufacturing and services sectors, as well as the outlook for key components of business costs in 2025. \n\n(I)  Unit Business Cost 1 in the Manufacturing and Services Sectors In 2024, unit business cost in the manufacturing and services sectors rose \n\nIn 2024, the unit business cost index for the manufacturing sector (UBCI) rose marginally by 0.2 per cent, easing from the 5.8 per cent increase in 2023 (Exhibit 1). The main contributor to the increase in UBCI in 2024 was the “others” cost component 2, which accounted for 1.2 percentage-points (pp) of the increase. This offset the declines in royalty payments 3, manufacturing unit labour cost (ULC) and the costs of work given out, which collectively contributed -1.0 pp to the UBCI increase. Meanwhile, the remaining cost components such as non-labour production taxes 4, utilities and rental costs 5 had a relatively small impact on the UBCI, in part due to their small shares in overall business costs. (Please refer to the Annex for the business cost structure of firms in the manufacturing and services sectors.) Source: Department of Statistics \n\nExhibit 1: Contribution to the UBCI Change by Key Cost Components \n\nAs for the overall services sector, its unit business cost index (UBC-Services Index) 6 rose by 5.8 per cent year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2024, a reversal from the 3.9 per cent year-on-year decline recorded for the same period in 2023 (Exhibit 2). 7 The pickup in the UBC-Services Index came on the back of increases in both non-labour costs (+5.1 pp contribution) and services ULC (+0.8 pp). In turn, the increase in non-labour costs was partly driven by higher sea freight rates compared to the first three quarters of 2023, which more than offset lower air freight rates over the same period. 1 Business costs tend to increase when firms produce a higher amount of output to meet demand. Unit business cost accounts for the change in output by measuring the business costs incurred to produce one unit of output. Only operating expenses (i.e., excluding materials costs and depreciation) are included in business costs based on the definition adopted by the Department of Statistics (DOS) in its computation of the Unit Business Cost for Manufacturing. See DOS’s Information Paper, “Methodological Review on the Unit Business Cost Index for Manufacturing Industry (Base Year 2010=100)”, at https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/ publications/economy/ip-e38.pdf. 2 “Others” costs include professional fees, advertising, commission & agency fees, sundry expenses etc. 3 Royalty payments refer to payments to another party (the licensor or franchisor who owns a particular asset) for the right to the ongoing use of that asset. There could be many reasons for changes in royalty payments. For instance, royalty payments vary with company-specific licensing agreements which could differ from year to year. Furthermore, royalties are usually computed as a percentage of sales, which could be volatile each year. 4 Non-labour production taxes include property, road and other indirect taxes. Labour-related taxes on production (e.g., foreign worker levy) are classified under labour cost. Taxes on income (e.g., corporate income tax) are not included in business costs. 5 Industrial rentals rose by 3.5 per cent in 2024, moderating from the 8.9 per cent increase in 2023. 6 The UBC-Services Index assesses cost conditions in the services sector. It is a composite index of proxy cost indicators for each component of business costs, combined using weights estimated from expenditure data in DOS’ Services Survey Series 2019, as well as the 2019 Input-Output tables. 7 The latest available UBC-Services Index is up to the third quarter of 2024. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n28 -8 -6 -4 -2 0246810 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 2023 2024 ULC Non-labour Cost UBC - Services Index \n\nContribution to YoY change, ppc \n\nExhibit 2: Contribution to UBC-Services Index Changes by Cost Components (II)  Latest Trends and Outlook for Key Cost Components Following a moderation in its pace of increase in 2024, the ULC for the overall economy is expected to rise at a broadly similar pace in 2025 \n\nThe ULC for the overall economy rose by 1.2 per cent in 2024, moderating from the 6.5 per cent increase in 2023 largely because of a pickup in productivity growth in 2024. 8,9 The increase in the overall ULC in 2024 was due to a rise in total labour cost 10 (TLC) per worker (4.0 per cent) which outstripped the increase in labour productivity 11 (2.7 per cent) (Exhibit 3). In turn, the increase in TLC per worker was mainly driven by higher remuneration per worker (+3.3 pp contribution). At the broad sectoral level, the ULC of the services producing industries (1.5 per cent) and construction sector (1.6 per cent) both increased in 2024 due to a rise in TLC per worker that outweighed labour productivity growth within the sector (Exhibit 4). By contrast, the manufacturing sector (-0.8 per cent) recorded a fall in ULC as labour productivity gains more than offset an increase in TLC per worker. Meanwhile, within the services producing industries, the food & beverage services (10.2 per cent), retail trade (6.2 per cent) and administrative & support services (6.2 per cent) sectors registered the largest ULC increases. For these three sectors, the increase in their ULCs was due to the combined effects of an increase in TLC per worker and a fall in labour productivity. For 2025, the ULC for the overall economy is likely to continue to rise at a pace that is broadly similar to that in 2024. Against the backdrop of rising global economic uncertainty, increases in remuneration per worker are likely to slow over the course of the year as employers turn more cautious and tightness in the labour market continues to ease. This will be broadly offset by an expected moderation in productivity growth in tandem with a slower pace of growth in the Singapore economy. Source: MTI Staff estimates Notes: (1) The 2023 and 2024 figures refer to the average of the UBC-Services Index for the first three quarters of the respective years; (2) Detailed cost component breakdown of the UBC-Services Index is not available; (3) Non-labour costs include air & sea freight costs, cargo handling costs and warehousing & storage costs. 8 A change in the ULC can be approximately decomposed as the change in total labour cost per worker minus the change in labour productivity (proxied by gross real value-added per worker). The approximation holds better when the changes are small. 9 In 2024, labour productivity growth came in at 2.7 per cent, a reversal from the 2.8 per cent decline in 2023. 10  TLC comprises remuneration, wage subsidies and other labour-related costs, which include the skills development levy, foreign worker levy, and recruitment and net training costs. 11  Labour productivity in this decomposition is proxied by real gross value-added per worker.

This is a common market practice in Asia. 14 EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook Report, February 2025. 15 As announced earlier by MSE, to meet the higher costs of supplying and producing water, the potable water price will increase by 50 cents per cubic metre in two phases over 2024 and 2025. This represents an increase in the water price of about 2.5 per cent per year since the last round of price revision in 2018.\n\nCosts of utilities, fuel and transportation are likely to moderate in 2025 \n\nThe cost of utilities borne by firms is closely linked to electricity costs, 12 which are in turn influenced by global oil prices. 13 Oil prices also contribute to business costs through fuel and transportation costs. In 2024, the average wholesale electricity price declined by 35 per cent (i.e., from $251/MWh in 2023 to $163/MWh in 2024), in part reflecting the moderation in global oil prices in the second half of 2024 (Exhibit 5). Global oil prices are projected to ease further in 2025 as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and selected non-member countries (i.e., OPEC+) gradually unwind their oil production cuts over the course of the year and global oil demand moderates. For 2025 as a whole, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has projected that global oil prices will average US$74 per barrel (/bbl) 14 , lower than the 2024 average of US$81/bbl. Correspondingly, domestic fuel and transportation costs are expected to moderate in 2025. Similarly, the domestic cost of utilities is expected to ease, notwithstanding the phased increase in water price 15 in 2025. \n\n10.2 6.2 6.2 4.4 3.8 3.6 3.2 1.6 1.5 0.7 0.4 -0.8 -2.0 -3.0 Food & Beverage Services Retail Trade Administrative & Support Services Other Services Industries Professional Services Real Estate Accommodation Construction Services Producing Industries Wholesale Trade Finance & Insurance Manufacturing Information & Communications Transportation & Storage Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n30 Exhibit 5: Global Oil Prices and Uniform Singapore Energy Prices (USEP), 1Q24 – 4Q24 Conclusion \n\nIn 2024, the UBCI for the manufacturing sector rose marginally as an increase in the “others” cost component outweighed the declines in royalty payments, manufacturing ULC and the costs of work given out. Meanwhile, the UBC-Services Index increased in the first three quarters of 2024 on account of an increase in non-labour costs and services ULC. For 2025, the overall ULC for the economy is likely to continue to rise at a pace that is broadly similar to that in 2024. Against the backdrop of rising global economic uncertainty, increases in remuneration per worker are likely to slow over the course of the year, even as productivity growth is expected to moderate in tandem with a slower pace of growth in the Singapore economy. At the same time, the costs of utilities, fuel and transportation are likely to moderate, in line with the outlook for global oil prices in 2025.

These three components collectively accounted for around 84 per cent of the business costs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and around 78 per cent of the business costs of non-SMEs in the sector in 2023. The remaining cost components, including utilities, fuel, rental of building/premises and charges paid to other firms for inland transportation and ocean/air/other freight, made up a smaller share of business costs, at around 16 per cent for SMEs and 22 per cent for non-SMEs in 2023. Non-labour production taxes, which include property, road and other indirect taxes, accounted for around 0.5 per cent of the business costs of both SMEs and non-SMEs over the same period. Details of the business cost structure of SMEs and non-SMEs in the various manufacturing clusters are in Exhibit A1. \n\nServices Sectors \n\nLabour cost constituted a major cost component for firms in the services sectors, with its share of business costs ranging from around 4 per cent on average for SMEs in the transportation & storage sector, to around 36 per cent or more for SMEs in labour-intensive sectors such as food & beverage services, accommodation and retail trade in 2023. On the other hand, utilities cost was a relatively small cost component for services firms, accounting for less than 2 per cent of the business costs of SMEs in most services sectors in 2023. Key exceptions were the accommodation and food & beverage services sectors, where utilities cost constituted 8 per cent and 6 per cent of the business costs of SMEs in these sectors respectively. Similarly, rental cost accounted for a small share of the business costs of SMEs in most services sectors. Key exceptions were the retail trade and food & beverage services sectors, where rental costs constituted around 23 per cent and 21 per cent of the business costs of SMEs in these sectors respectively. Similar to the manufacturing sector, non-labour production taxes accounted for less than 1 per cent of the business costs of firms in most services sectors.

The increase was due to the growth in re-exports, which outweighed the decline in domestic exports. Domestic exports fell by 6.0 per cent, a pullback from the 5.4 per cent growth in the third quarter. Meanwhile, re-exports expanded by 13.9 per cent, accelerating from the 5.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter.

The increase in NODX was due to the growth in electronics NODX, even as non-electronics NODX fell. \n\nExhibit 4.2: Changes in Domestic Exports \n\n> Per Cent -10 -5 0510\n> IV III II IIV\n> 2024 2023 Domestic Exports Non-Oil Domestic Exports\n\nExhibit 4.1: Growth Rates of Total Merchandise Trade, Merchandise Exports and Merchandise Imports (In Nominal Terms) 2023 2024 2024 I II III IV Total Merchandise Trade -11.7 4.6 9.9 5.3 6.8 6.6 Merchandise Exports -10.1 4.4 7.5 5.7 5.1 5.7 Domestic Exports -13.5 0.3 2.9 5.4 -6.0 0.5 Oil -14.2 6.0 19.0 -0.2 -17.9 1.0 Non-Oil -13.1 -3.4 -6.5 9.0 2.4 0.2 Re-Exports -7.1 7.8 11.5 5.9 13.9 9.8 Merchandise Imports -13.4 5.0 12.5 5.0 8.7 7.8 Oil -19.0 2.1 16.0 -7.7 -9.5 -0.3 Non-oil -11.9 5.7 11.7 8.3 13.7 9.9 OVERVIEW \n\nSingapore’s total merchandise trade increased by 6.8 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, faster than the 5.3 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. At the same time, total services trade increased by 7.4 per cent year-on-year, moderating from the 10.8 per cent growth in the third quarter. For the whole of 2024, Singapore’s total merchandise trade expanded by 6.6 per cent to S$1.3 trillion, compared to the S$1.2 trillion in 2023. Oil trade declined by 0.1 per cent amidst lower oil prices compared to a year ago, while non-oil trade increased by 8.3 per cent. Merchandise exports and imports increased by 5.7 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. Total services trade grew by 8.6 per cent to $998 billion in 2024, up from $919 billion in 2023. Services exports and imports increased by 9.9 per cent and 7.1 per cent respectively in 2024. Chapter 4: International Trade \n\n39 Exhibit 4.3: Growth Rates of Non-Oil Domestic Exports to Top 10 Markets in 2024        \n\n> Per Cent -30 -20 -10 010 20 30\n> EU Japan United States Taiwan Thailand South Korea China Indonesia Hong Kong Malaysia 18.9 17.7 8.0 4.9 4.9 4.5 3.8 -6.6 -17.6 -21.4\n\nElectronics NODX grew by 14.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, moderating from the 16.3 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. The growth in electronic NODX was primarily due to an increase in the domestic exports of ICs, disk media products and PCs. Non-electronics NODX declined by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, a reversal from the 7.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter. The decline in non-electronics NODX was primarily due to lower domestic exports of pharmaceuticals, specialised machinery and petrochemicals. For the full year, NODX grew by 0.2 per cent, a reversal from the 13.1 per cent contraction in 2023. The growth in NODX was due to increased shipments of electronics (+8.2 per cent), which outweighed the decline in non-electronics (-1.9 per cent). The top 10 NODX markets accounted for 80.0 per cent of Singapore’s total NODX in 2024. Singapore’s NODX to most markets increased even as NODX to the EU 27 (-21.4 per cent), Japan (-17.6 per cent) and the US (-6.6 per cent) declined. NODX to EU 27 contracted mainly because of a decline in the exports of pharmaceuticals, telecommunications equipment and specialised machinery. NODX to the US fell on the back of a decline in the exports of pharmaceuticals, structures of ships & boats and telecommunications equipment. Meanwhile, pharmaceuticals, miscellaneous manufactured articles and measuring instruments contributed the most to the decline in NODX to Japan. On the other hand, NODX to Malaysia grew due to higher exports of ICs, other computer peripherals and non-monetary gold. \n\nOil Domestic Exports \n\nOil domestic exports contracted by 17.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 0.2 per cent decline in the previous quarter. The decline in oil domestic exports was led by lower exports to economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia. The decrease also partly reflected lower oil prices compared to the same quarter a year ago. In volume terms, oil domestic exports declined by 5.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, a reversal from the 15.9 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. For the full year, oil domestic exports rose by 1.0 per cent year-on-year, a turnaround from the 14.2 per cent contraction in 2023. By economies, it was driven mainly by higher exports to Indonesia, China and Liberia. In volume terms, oil domestic exports increased by 5.7 per cent in 2024, picking up from the 2.2 per cent growth in 2023. \n\nNon-Oil Re-Exports \n\nNon-oil re-exports (NORX) expanded by 14.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the 6.5 per cent growth in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 4.4). The growth in NORX could be attributed to an increase in both electronics and non-electronics NORX. Electronics NORX rose by 16.4 per cent, extending the 12.3 per cent increase in the third quarter, as the re-exports of ICs, PCs and parts of PCs grew. Meanwhile, non-electronics NORX rose by 11.8 per cent, faster than the 0.1 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. The growth in non-electronics NORX was mainly driven by higher re-exports of non-monetary gold, non-electric engines & motors and specialised machinery.

The growth in NORX was due to an increase in both electronics NORX (+16.2 per cent) and non-electronics NORX (+3.8 per cent). NORX to the top 10 NORX markets as a whole grew in 2024 (Exhibit 4.5). NORX to Malaysia expanded on the back of an increase in the re-exports of PCs, other computer peripherals and parts of PCs. Meanwhile, higher shipments of ICs, PCs and telecommunications equipment led to an increase in NORX to Hong Kong. Re-exports to Thailand rose on account of an increase in the shipments of ICs, consumer electronics and parts of PCs. \n\nMerchandise Imports \n\nNon-oil imports expanded by 13.7 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, following the 8.3 per cent growth in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 4.6). The growth in non-oil imports was due to an increase in both electronics (+28.8 per cent) and non-electronics imports (+4.3 per cent). In turn, the growth in electronics imports was due to an increase in the imports of ICs, PCs and other computer peripherals. Meanwhile, the growth in non-electronics imports was due to the imports of non-electric engines & motors, non-monetary gold and specialised machinery. Oil imports declined by 9.5 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 7.7 per cent decline in the preceding quarter. The decrease in oil imports was due partly to lower oil prices. In volume terms, oil imports increased by 1.1 per cent, improving from the 3.8 per cent decline in the third quarter. For the full year of 2024, non-oil imports rose by 9.9 per cent, a turnaround from the 11.9 per cent contraction in 2023. Meanwhile, oil imports declined by 0.3 per cent, easing from the 19.0 per cent contraction in 2023.

The growth in services exports was primarily driven by the exports of transport services and financial services, which grew by 14.6 per cent and 13.7 per cent respectively. For the full year, services exports expanded by 9.9 per cent, picking up from the 2.7 per cent increase in 2023. The increase in services exports was attributable mainly to the exports of transport services, other business services and financial services, which grew by 15.7 per cent, 5.7 per cent and 9.6 per cent respectively. \n\nServices Imports \n\nServices imports expanded by 6.4 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, easing from the 9.5 per cent growth in the previous quarter. The growth in services imports was led by the imports of transport services, other business services and travel services, which expanded by 7.4 per cent, 4.0 per cent and 13.8 per cent respectively. For the whole of 2024, services imports expanded by 7.1 per cent, the same rate of growth as in 2023. The growth in services imports was mainly due to the imports of transport services and travel services, which grew by 8.3 per cent and 20.2 per cent respectively.

For 2024 as a whole, the current account surplus rose by $8.3 billion to $128 billion (17.5 per cent of GDP). The increase was driven by a larger services account surplus and a narrowing of the primary income deficit, which more than offset a smaller goods account surplus and a larger secondary income deficit. In terms of the components of the current account, the goods surplus came in at $48.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, edging up from $48.2 billion in the third quarter, as exports rose more than imports (Exhibit 5.2). For 2024 as a whole, the goods surplus stood at $198 billion, lower than the $211 billion in 2023, as imports increased more than exports. The surplus in the services balance fell to $15.1 billion in the fourth quarter, from $17.4 billion in the preceding quarter. For the whole of 2024, the surplus in the services balance increased to $59.4 billion, from $42.9 billion in 2023. This was mainly driven by a rise in net receipts for transport services, financial services, and other business services. These more than offset the rise in net payments for travel services. The primary income deficit widened by $4.0 billion from the previous quarter to $32.5 billion in the fourth quarter. For the year as a whole, the deficit narrowed by $5.9 billion to $119 billion, as receipts rose more than payments. \n\nExhibit 5.2: Components of Current Account Balance Exhibit 5.1: Current Account Balance   \n\n> $ Billion 2023 2024 25 30 35\n> IV III II IIV\n> $ Billion 2023 2024 -40 -20 020 40 60\n> IV III II IIV\n> Goods Balance Services Balance Primary Income Balance Secondary Income Balance\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nSingapore’s overall balance of payments recorded a deficit of $11.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, a reversal from the surplus of $17.3 billion in the third quarter. For the whole of 2024, the overall balance of payments registered a surplus of $39.7 billion, lower than the surplus of $81.8 billion in 2023. The smaller surplus was mainly due to an increase in net outflows from the capital and financial account. Singapore’s official foreign reserves rose to $507 billion at the end of 2024.

For more details regarding the change in sign convention to the financial account, please refer to DOS’s information paper on “Singapore’s International Accounts: Methodological Updates and Recent Developments”.\n\n## CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNT \n\nThe capital and financial account 1 registered a larger net outflow of $39.1 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to $17.1 billion in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 5.3). For 2024 as a whole, net outflows amounted to $88.1 billion (12.0 per cent of GDP), up from the $39.4 billion in 2023. The increase was due mainly to higher net outflows of “other investment”, and financial derivatives switching to net outflows from net inflows in the preceding year. These more than offset the rise in net inflows of direct investment and a decline in net outflows of portfolio investment. In terms of the components of the capital and financial account, net outflows of “other investment” came in at $62.9 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $29.9 billion in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 5.4). For the full year, net outflows of “other investment” rose to $110 billion, an increase from the $35.4 billion registered in 2023. This was in part due to higher net outflows from resident deposit-taking corporations as well as the resident non-bank private sector. At the same time, net inflows of direct investment reached $38.9 billion in the fourth quarter, higher than the $30.1 billion in the previous quarter. For 2024 as a whole, net inflows of direct investment rose by $3.6 billion to $129 billion, as the increase in foreign direct investment flows into Singapore exceeded that of residents’ direct investments abroad. Financial derivatives switched to net outflows of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, from net inflows of $3.0 billion in the preceding quarter. For 2024 as a whole, financial derivatives reversed to net outflows of $2.4 billion, from net inflows of $1.9 billion in 2023. Net outflows of portfolio investment fell to $13.4 billion in the fourth quarter, from $20.3 billion in the previous quarter. For the full year, net outflows of portfolio investment fell by $26.4 billion to $105 billion in 2024. The decline in net outflows was attributable to resident deposit-taking corporations, as well as the resident non-bank private sector which switched to net inflows in 2024 from net outflows in the previous year.

For the whole of 2024, the manufacturing sector grew by 4.3 per cent, reversing the 4.2 per cent decline in 2023. Growth in the sector was supported by output expansions across all clusters except the biomedical manufacturing cluster (Exhibit 6.2). \n\n## PERFORMANCE OF CLUSTERS \n\nThe electronics cluster grew by 15.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, supported by output expansions in all segments except for the other electronic modules & components segment. Output of the infocomms & consumer electronics, computer peripherals & data storage and semiconductors segments grew by 26.2 per cent, 24.1 per cent and 15.0 per cent respectively, on the back of improved demand. By contrast, output of the other electronic modules & components segment declined by 2.0 per cent. For the whole of 2024, the electronics cluster expanded by 8.4 per cent. \n\nExhibit 6.1: Manufacturing Growth Rates  \n\n> Per Cent 2023 2024 -5 0510 15\n> IV III II IIV\n> 1.8 7.4 11.2 -0.6 -1.1\n\nExhibit 6.2: Manufacturing Clusters’ Growth     \n\n> Per Cent 2024 2023 -20 -10 010 20\n> Biomedical General Manufacturing Precision Engineering Chemicals Electronics Transport Engineering Total Manufacturing Industries Manufacturing\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe manufacturing sector expanded by 7.4 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, moderating from the 11.2 per cent increase in the preceding quarter. Growth was largely led by the electronics and transport engineering clusters. For the whole of 2024, the manufacturing sector grew by 4.3 per cent, reversing the 4.2 per cent decline in 2023. All clusters recorded output expansions except for the biomedical manufacturing cluster. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n56 \n\n# Chapter 6.1 Output in the transport engineering cluster increased by 8.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, led by the 15.8 per cent growth in the aerospace segment on account of a higher level of demand for aircraft parts and an increase in maintenance, repair and overhaul jobs from commercial airlines. The land and marine & offshore engineering segments grew by 5.6 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. For the full year, the transport engineering cluster expanded by 9.4 per cent. The general manufacturing cluster grew by 0.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, supported by higher production in the food, beverages & tobacco segment. The food, beverages & tobacco segment grew 3.6 per cent on account of a higher production of milk powder, cocoa products and animal feed additives. On the other hand, output of the printing and miscellaneous industries segments declined by 1.0 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively, with the latter recording a lower production of structural metal products and paperboard containers and boxes. For the whole of 2024, the general manufacturing cluster expanded by 1.3 per cent. The chemicals cluster contracted by 0.1 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, driven by an output contraction in the specialties segment. Output in the specialties segment declined by 26.2 per cent on account of a lower level of production of mineral oil additives and biofuels. By contrast, output of the other chemicals segment grew 7.6 per cent with a higher level of output of fragrances. The petroleum and petrochemicals segments grew 6.1 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively, with the former growing from a low base the previous year due to plant maintenance shutdowns. For the whole of 2024, output of the chemicals cluster rose by 4.3 per cent. Output in the precision engineering cluster declined by 3.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter. The machinery and systems segment contracted by 5.7 per cent due to a lower production of semiconductor-related equipment. By contrast, the precision modules & components segment grew by 1.8 per cent on account of a higher output of optical instruments, plastic precision components and electronic connectors. For 2024 as a whole, output in the precision engineering cluster grew by 2.3 per cent. The biomedical manufacturing cluster contracted by 4.4 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, driven by an output contraction in the pharmaceuticals segment. The pharmaceuticals segment declined by 10.7 per cent on account of a lower level of production of biological products and a different mix of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) being produced. On the other hand, output in the medical technology segment expanded by 4.6 per cent, supported by continued export demand for medical devices. For the whole of 2024, the biomedical manufacturing cluster declined by 12.5 per cent.

The expansion was supported by an increase in contracts awarded for public commercial buildings (284 per cent) and public institutional and other buildings (117 per cent), Some of the major projects awarded during the year include (i) MPA’s office building at Cantonment Road; (ii) foundation works for MOH’s Eastern Integrated Health Campus and the redevelopment of Alexandra Hospital; (iii) NHB’s Founders’ Memorial; (iv) MOH’s Health Sciences Authority Building; (v) SCB’s New Science Centre; (vi) PA’s Bukit Timah Integrated Development; and (vii) various contracts under LTA’s Cross Island MRT Line (Phase 2). \n\nPrivate Sector \n\nIn the fourth quarter, private sector construction demand increased by 54.6 per cent year-on-year to $5.3 billion. Except for commercial building and civil engineering projects, which registered contractions of 10.0 per cent and 89.8 per cent respectively, demand expanded for all other types of projects, ranging from 7.7 per cent for institutional building projects to 152 per cent for residential building projects. For the full year, private sector construction demand grew by 32.5 per cent to $19.7 billion, on the back of higher demand for all building developments, including private residential (43.8 per cent), commercial (44.5 per cent), industrial (9.2 per cent) and institutional and other building (74.4 per cent) projects (Exhibit 6.4). Major projects awarded in 2024 include (i) development of various past en-bloc sales and GLS sites; (ii) Resorts World at Sentosa 2.0; (iii) Singtel’s Comcentre redevelopment; (iv) VisionPower’s semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility at Tampines; (v) PSA Supply Chain Hub@Tuas; (vi) YTL Powerseraya’s Combined Cycle Power Plant and (vii) Perennial Holdings’ Geriatric Care Home at Parry Avenue. \n\n## CONSTRUCTION OUTPUT \n\nConstruction output (or nominal certified payments) rose by 8.4 per cent year-on-year to $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter, supported by expansions in both public and private sector construction output (Exhibit 6.5). For the full year, construction output increased by 10.0 per cent to $38.4 billion, extending the 15.4 per cent growth in 2023. \n\nPublic Sector \n\nPublic sector construction output rose by 16.1 per cent year-on-year to $5.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Construction output for all development types increased, supported by residential building (15.9 per cent), commercial building (25.6 per cent), industrial building (12.5 per cent), institutional and other building (10.8 per cent) and civil engineering (19.4 per cent) projects. For the full year, public sector construction output increased by 19.1 per cent to $20.6 billion, underpinned by expansion in outputs of all development types including residential building (20.0 per cent), commercial building (15.4 per cent), industrial building (44.4 per cent), institutional and other building (10.1 per cent) and civil engineering (19.5 per cent) works. Apart from public housing projects, other major projects supporting the growth included (i) MHA’s extension of the ICA Building; (ii) JTC’s Punggol Digital District, Space@AMK and Bulim Square; (iii) NEA’s Integrated Waste Management Facility; (iv) MOH’s SGH Elective Care Centre/National Dental Centre; (v) LTA’s Singapore Rail Test Centre; (vi) Sport Singapore’s Punggol Regional Sports Centre; (vii) SIT Campus@Punggol North (Plot 1); and (viii) LTA’s Cross Island MRT Line, Jurong Region MRT Line, East Coast Integrated Depot and North South Corridor.  \n\n> 0246810 12\n> IV III II IIV\n> $ Billion 2023 2024 Total Private Public Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance\n\n59 Private Sector \n\nIn the fourth quarter, private sector construction output increased slightly by 0.7 per cent year-on-year to $4.8 billion. The growth in residential building (5.2 per cent), institutional and other building (21.6 per cent) and civil engineering (20.2 per cent) works was weighed down by the contractions in commercial (-2.0 per cent) and industrial (-7.4 per cent) building works. For the full year, private sector construction output grew by 1.2 per cent to $17.9 billion. The expansions in construction output for residential building (2.4 per cent), institutional and other building (4.9 per cent) and civil engineering (28.1 per cent) works were weighed down by the declines in commercial (-3.1 per cent) and industrial (-2.8 per cent) building works. Major ongoing projects include (i) various condominiums from past en-bloc sales sites and GLS sites; (ii) mixed-used integrated developments; (iii) RWS’ Singapore Oceanarium; (iv) Mandai Park Development’s Rainforest Park North and East Arrival Node; and (v) SP Powerassets’ power cabling and installation works. \n\n## CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS \n\nIn tandem with the rise in construction output, total consumption of ready-mixed concrete increased by 9.1 per cent in 2024 to 13.4 million m 3. Similarly, total consumption of steel rebars 1 rose by 3.9 per cent to about 1.6 million tonnes in 2024. The average market price of Grade 40 pump ready-mixed concrete 2 increased by 4.0 per cent to about $120.37 per m 3 in the fourth quarter of 2024, due to stronger local demand for ready-mixed concrete. On the other hand, the average market price of steel rebars 3 fell by 9.4 per cent to around $746.87 per tonne in the fourth quarter, due to softening of global steel demand (Exhibit 6.6). \n\n## CONSTRUCTION COSTS \n\nBCA’s Building Works Tender Price Index (TPI) remained relatively stable and is estimated to have increased by 1 per cent to 2 per cent year-on-year in 2024 (Exhibit 6.7). Looking ahead, domestic construction tender prices are likely to be supported by strong demand for construction works over the medium-term. \n\nExhibit 6.7: Changes in Tender Price Index    \n\n> 1Rebar consumption is estimated from net imports plus local production (without factoring in stock levels). 2The market prices are based on contracts with non-fixed price and market retail price. 3The market prices refer to 16mm to 32mm High Tensile rebars and are based on fixed price supply contracts with a contract period of 6 months or below.\n\nExhibit 6.6: Changes in Market Prices of Construction Materials  \n\n> Per Cent\n> 2023 2024 -20 -10 010\n> IV III II IIV\n> Ready-Mixed Concrete Steel Bars\n> Per Cent 0510 15\n> 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Economic Survey of Singapore 2024\n\n60 CONSTRUCTION OUTLOOK IN 2025 \n\nAccording to BCA, total construction demand is projected to be between $47.0 billion and $53.0 billion in 2025 (Exhibit 6.8). The strong construction demand in 2025 is mainly due to the expected awards of large-scale projects such as expansion of Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort (MBS IR2) and development of Changi Airport Terminal 5 (T5). Taking into account contracts awarded in recent years and the construction demand forecast for 2025, total nominal construction output is projected to be between $39 billion and $42 billion in 2025, higher than the preliminary estimate of about $38.4 billion in 2024. This growth is expected to be bolstered by strong construction demand over the past few years and a projected increase in demand in 2025. \n\nExhibit 6.8: Projected Construction Demand in 2025 $ Billion TOTAL CONSTRUCTION DEMAND 47.0 - 53.0 Building Construction Sub-total 38.1 - 43.0 Residential 13.8 - 15.2 \n\nCommercial 3.6 - 5.1 \n\nIndustrial 5.1 - 5.6 \n\nInstitutional & Others 15.6 - 17.0 \n\nCivil Engineering Works Sub-total 9.0 - 10.0 Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance \n\n61 WHOLESALE TRADE \n\n## WHOLESALE SALES \n\nIn the fourth quarter, the wholesale trade sector was supported by an increase in both foreign and domestic wholesale sales volumes. Specifically, foreign wholesale sales volume rose by 6.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, easing from the 10.2 per cent increase in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 6.9). Growth in sales volume was fastest in the household equipment & furniture (23.1 per cent), general wholesale trade (19.0 per cent), and food, beverages & tobacco (16.5 per cent) segments, which outpaced the decline in the sales volume of the industrial & construction machinery (-10.8 per cent), transport equipment (-0.9 per cent) and metals, timber & construction materials (-0.1 per cent). For the whole of 2024, the foreign wholesale trade index rose by 7.6 per cent, a marked acceleration from the 1.0 per cent growth in the previous year. Meanwhile, domestic wholesale sales volume expanded by 2.5 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, a reversal from the 4.3 per cent decline in the preceding quarter. Growth in sales volume was the strongest in the metals, timber & construction materials (32.1 per cent), transport equipment (20.2 per cent) and general wholesale trade (20.1 per cent) segments, offsetting the contraction in the sales volume of industrial & construction machinery (-22.3 per cent) and electronic components (-11.0 per cent). For the whole of 2024, the domestic wholesale trade index contracted by 1.5 per cent, extending the 1.1 per cent decline posted in 2023. \n\nExhibit 6.9: Changes in Wholesale Trade Index in Chained Volume Terms  \n\n> Per Cent 2023 2024 -10 -5 0510 15\n> IV III II IIV\n> Foreign Wholesale Trade Index Domestic Wholesale Trade Index\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe wholesale trade sector expanded by 6.7 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 6.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter. Growth during the quarter was largely supported by the machinery, equipment & supplies segment on the back of the wholesale sales of electronic components and telecommunications & computers. At the same time, the fuels & chemicals segment grew due to an increase in the wholesale volume of petroleum & petroleum products and chemicals & chemical products. For the whole of 2024, the sector grew by 5.1 per cent, picking up from the 0.9 per cent expansion in 2023. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n62 \n\n# Chapter 6.3 RETAIL TRADE \n\nFor the full year, overall retail sales volume decreased by 0.2 per cent, reversing from the 0.4 per cent expansion in 2023. In 2024, non-motor vehicle sales volume shrank by 2.2 per cent. The decline in non-motor vehicle sales was led by the sales of computer & telecommunications equipment (-8.8 per cent), watches & jewellery (-6.7 per cent) and wearing apparel & footwear (-4.1 per cent). On the other hand, the sales volumes of food & alcohol (7.1 per cent), cosmetics, toiletries & medical goods (1.6 per cent) and supermarkets & hypermarkets (1.1 per cent) grew. Meanwhile, motor vehicle sales volume grew by 15.1 per cent due to an increase in COE quotas (Exhibit 6.11). \n\n## RETAIL SALES \n\nOverall retail sales volume decreased by 1.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 0.3 per cent decline in the third quarter (Exhibit 6.10). Overall retail sales were weighed down by the decrease in non-motor vehicle sales volume (-3.1 per cent). This was led by declines in the sales volumes of computer & telecommunications equipment (-14.1 per cent), watches & jewellery (-11.6 per cent), and optical goods & books (-4.6 per cent). On the other hand, the recreational goods (3.7 per cent), cosmetics, toiletries & medical goods (2.9 per cent) and supermarkets & hypermarkets (1.6 per cent) segments grew. Meanwhile, motor vehicle sales volume grew by 13.9 per cent due to an increase in COE quotas. \n\nExhibit 6.10: Changes in Retail Sales Index in Chained Volume Terms \n\n> Per Cent\n\n2023 2024 -6 -4 -2 024\n\nIV III II IIV \n\n> Total Total (excluding Motor Vehicles)\n\nExhibit 6.11: Changes in Retail Sales Index in Chained Volume Terms for Major Segments in 2024        \n\n> -15 -10 -5 0510 15 20\n> Computer & Telecomms Equipment Watches & Jewellery Optical Goods & Books Mini-marts & Convenience Stores Wearing Apparel & Footwear Petrol Service Stations Department Stores Recreational Goods Furniture & Household Equipment Others Supermarkets & Hypermarkets Cosmetics, Toiletries & Medical Goods Food & Alcohol Motor Vehicles\n> Per Cent 15.1 7.1 1.6 1.1 0.4 -0.2 -0.7 -3.2 -3.8 -4.1 -6.0 -6.2 -6.7 -8.8\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe retail trade sector contracted by 1.0 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 0.7 per cent decline in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2024, the sector contracted by 0.4 per cent, reversing from the 2.8 per cent growth in 2023. Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance \n\n63 \n\n# Chapter 6.4 TRANSPORTATION & STORAGE \n\n## WATER TRANSPORT \n\nContainer throughput grew by 3.8 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, easing from the 5.1 per cent expansion in the previous quarter (Exhibit 6.12). For the full year, the number of TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units) handled by Singapore’s ports came in at 41.1 million, representing a 5.4 per cent expansion, accelerating from the 4.6 per cent growth clocked in 2023. \n\n## AIR TRANSPORT \n\nTotal air passenger traffic (less transit) handled by Changi Airport climbed by 10.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 10.1 per cent growth in the previous quarter (Exhibit 6.13). In absolute terms, air passenger traffic volume recovered to 100 per cent of the volume seen in the fourth quarter of 2019 (pre-pandemic). For the full year, total air passenger traffic passing through Changi Airport climbed by 14.8 per cent to come in at 67.1 million, moderating from the 83.1 per cent increase posted in 2023. Overall sea cargo volume expanded by 1.3 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, moderating from the 3.2 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. The expansion in sea cargo volume was led by growth in general cargo shipments, which expanded by 1.1 per cent during the quarter, easing from the 5.8 per cent growth registered in the third quarter. For the whole of 2024, overall sea cargo volume grew by 5.2 per cent, improving from the 2.4 per cent increase in the previous year. \n\nExhibit 6.12: Changes in Container Throughput and Sea Cargo Handled \n\n> Per Cent\n\n0510 15 \n\nIV III II IIV \n\n> Sea Cargo Container Throughput\n\n2023 2024 \n\nExhibit 6.13: Changes in Air Transport \n\n> Per Cent\n\n-10 010 20 30 40 \n\nIV III II IIV \n\n2023 2024 \n\n> Air Passengers Air Cargo Aircraft Landings\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe transportation & storage sector expanded by 3.7 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, moderating from the 7.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2024, the sector grew at a faster pace of 5.8 per cent compared to the 3.5 per cent expansion recorded in 2023. The expansion of the sector was supported largely by the water transport, air transport and storage & other support services segments. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n64 \n\n# Chapter 6.5 Meanwhile, air cargo volume grew by 15.0 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, following the 13.5 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. In absolute terms, total air cargo volume was at 99.9 per cent of pre-pandemic levels (i.e., in the fourth quarter of 2019). For 2024 as a whole, air cargo shipments grew by 14.6 per cent, reversing the 6.1 per cent contraction posted in 2023. Meanwhile, aircraft landings climbed by 9.3 per cent year-on-year to reach 47,630 in the fourth quarter, following the 7.5 per cent increase in the third quarter. This brought the total number of aircraft landings in 2024 to 182,951, which was 11.5 per cent higher than in 2023. Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance \n\n65 ACCOMMODATION \n\n## VISITOR ARRIVALS \n\nSingapore received around 3.9 million visitors in the fourth quarter, 13.9 per cent higher compared to the same period a year ago (Exhibit 6.14). Compared to the same quarter in 2019 (pre-pandemic), visitor arrivals remained 17.7 per cent lower. For the full year, visitor arrivals increased by 21.5 per cent, slowing from the 116 per cent expansion in 2023. In terms of source markets, Singapore’s top ten markets in 2024 were China (3.1 million visitors), Indonesia (2.5 million), India (1.2 million), Malaysia (1.2 million), Australia (1.2 million), the Philippines (779 thousand), the USA (692 thousand), South Korea (595 thousand), the UK (580 thousand) and Japan (573 thousand). Together, they accounted for 74.7 per cent of total visitor arrivals in 2024. Among the top 10 source markets, China (126 per cent), Japan (32.4 per cent) and the UK (22.5 per cent) posted the strongest growth in visitor arrivals in 2024 (Exhibit 6.15).

For the whole of 2024, the sector expanded by 7.1 per cent, slowing from the 15.7 per cent growth in 2023. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n66 \n\n# Chapter 6.6 ACCOMMODATION \n\nIn tandem with the strong recovery in visitor arrivals, gross lettings of gazetted hotel rooms grew by 7.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 7.7 per cent growth in the previous quarter (Exhibit 6.16). Similarly, room revenue expanded by 7.2 per cent, picking up from the 5.2 per cent increase in the preceding quarter. This was accompanied by increases in average room rates and in average occupancy rates of gazetted hotels. Specifically, the average occupancy rate rose by 3.4 percentage points, while the average room rate grew by 0.1 per cent to $271 in the fourth quarter. For 2024 as a whole, the accommodation sector grew by 7.1 per cent, driven by the recovery in tourism demand. The overall room revenue of gazetted hotels climbed by 11.4 per cent to reach $5.3 billion in 2024, driven by a 10.0 per cent expansion in gross lettings and a 1.4 per cent increase in average daily room rates. \n\nExhibit 6.16: Gross Lettings  \n\n> 2023 2024 01000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n> IV III II IIV\n> Thousand -5 0510 15 20 25 Per Cent YoY Change (RHS) Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance\n\n67 FOOD & BEVERAGE SERVICES \n\n## FOOD & BEVERAGE SALES \n\nOverall food & beverage sales volume declined marginally 1year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 1.0 per cent contraction in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 6.17). This was led by declines in the sales volume of fast food outlets (-3.2 per cent), cafes, food courts & other eating places (-2.4 per cent) and restaurants (-1.0 per cent) segments. On the other hand, sales of the food caterers segment continued to grow (14.7 per cent) in tandem with the continued recovery in inbound tourism demand. For the whole of 2024, the food & beverage services volume index declined by 0.5 per cent. This was a reversal from the 3.3 per cent expansion registered in 2023. At the segment level, the sales volumes of food caterers (15.9 per cent) grew, while that of fast food outlets (-5.4 per cent), restaurants (-3.2 per cent) and cafes, food courts & other eating places (-0.7 per cent) shrank. \n\nExhibit 6.17: Changes in Food and Beverage Services Index in Chained Volume Terms \n\n2023 2024 -3 -2 -1 01\n\nIV III II IIV \n\n> Per Cent\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe food & beverage services sector contracted by 0.3 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 1.3 per cent decline in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2024, the sector contracted by 0.9 per cent, a reversal from the 5.6 per cent expansion in 2023. 1 Sales volume declined by -0.04 per cent. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n68 \n\n# Chapter 6.7 1 The “others” segment consists of (i) publishing activities (including computer games and software publishing), (ii) motion picture, video and other programme production, sound recording, and music publishing activities, and (iii) radio and television broadcasting activities. 2 Full-year data are not available at the time of publication. \n\n# INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS \n\n## IT & INFORMATION SERVICES \n\nIn 2024, the growth of the information & communications sector was led by the IT & information services segment. Specifically, the segment expanded by 6.8 per cent, driven by strong enterprise demand for digital solutions and services. \n\nExhibit 6.18: Information & Communications Growth \n\n-10 -5 0510 \n\n2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 \n\n> Per Cent Broadband Subscriptions Mobile Subscriptions\n\n## TELECOMMUNICATIONS \n\nThe telecommunications segment grew by 0.2 per cent in 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the latest period where data is available, total fixed line subscriptions grew by 3.5 per cent. As at October 2024 2, the number of mobile subscriptions grew by 3.8 per cent compared to the same month in 2023 (Exhibit 6.18). While there was a 97.3 per cent decline in the number of 3G subscriptions to 2,200, this was offset by the 0.2 per cent increase in 4G subscriptions to 7.5 million and the 23.9 per cent increase in 5G subscriptions to around 2.2 million. In October 2024, the number of broadband subscriptions rose by 6.3 per cent. The increase was driven by optical fibre broadband (2.1 per cent) and wireless broadband (7.0 per cent) subscriptions. \n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe information & communications sector expanded by 4.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 4.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter. This positive outturn was largely due to strong growth in the IT & information services and “others” segments 1, while the telecommunications segment contracted during the quarter. For the whole of 2024, the sector grew by 5.0 per cent, a slowdown from the 11.2 per cent expansion in 2023. Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance \n\n69 \n\n# Chapter 6.8 FINANCE & INSURANCE \n\n## OVERALL PERFORMANCE \n\nThe finance & insurance sector grew strongly in 2024, with broad-based expansions recorded across the segments, including banking, fund management, insurance and activities auxiliary to financial services (which largely comprise the payments firms) (Exhibit 6.19). Trading activity was generally elevated during the year amid shifts in global and domestic financial market sentiments, leading to strong growth in net fees and commissions among banks and fund managers. The insurance industry recorded a surge in new premiums among life insurers, while the auxiliary financial services segment benefited from higher cross border transactions associated with greater travel spending. \n\nExhibit 6.20: Growth of Bank Loans and Advances to Non-Bank Residents and Non-Residents (Per Cent) Exhibit 6.19: Finance & Insurance Growth Rates \n\nPer Cent 2023 2024 \n\n0246810 \n\nIV III II IIV \n\n7.4 6.1 5.6 7.4 8.3 \n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe finance & insurance sector expanded by 6.1 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, improving from the 5.6 per cent growth in the previous quarter.

Single premium business rose by 7.4 per cent to $16.7 billion while regular premium business expanded by 28.5 per cent to $6.1 billion. In the general insurance industry, gross premiums expanded by 2.5 per cent to $19.8 billion in 2024, with offshore and domestic businesses accounting for $14.0 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. \n\nExhibit 6.21: Premiums in the Insurance Industry \n\n## SECURITY DEALING ACTIVITIES \n\nIn 2024, the turnover volume of the securities market fell by 0.7 per cent to 338.4 billion shares, even as portfolios shifted towards non-cash equivalent assets amid the global easing in monetary policy. The turnover volume of the derivatives market grew by 18.4 per cent to 298 contracts in 2024, expanding steadily throughout the year underpinned by elevated futures trading activity (Exhibit 6.22). \n\nExhibit 6.22: Securities and Derivatives Turnover Volumes    \n\n> 050 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n> Derivatives (RHS) Securities\n> Billion Shares Million Contracts\n> 2023 2024 050 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n> $ Billion 0510 15 20\n> General Insurance Industry Life Industry Industry\n> 2023 2024 Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance\n\n71 REAL ESTATE & PROFESSIONAL SERVICES \n\n## REAL ESTATE \n\nThe private residential property market expanded on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter, as total private residential property sales rose by 71.5 per cent, accelerating from the 3.3 per cent increase in the previous quarter. For the full year, total sales rose by 15.3 per cent to 21,950 units, from the 19,044 units sold in 2023. Private residential certified progress payments (a proxy for developers’ margins) rose by 5.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 6.1 per cent increase in the preceding quarter. For the whole of 2024, private residential certified progress payments climbed by 2.4 per cent, moderating from the increase of 11.0 per cent in 2023 (Exhibit 6.23). \n\nExhibit 6.23: Total Sales for Private Residential Units and Private Residential Certified Payments Exhibit 6.24: Total Occupied Space for Private Sector Commercial Office and Retail Spaces \n\nIn the private commercial retail space market, the performance remained resilient in the fourth quarter. Specifically, demand for private commercial retail space (measured by total occupied space) rose by 2.1 per cent year-on-year, extending the 2.8 per cent increase in the third quarter. For the full year, demand for private commercial retail space grew by 2.4 per cent, higher than the 2.0 per cent increase in 2023. Meanwhile, demand for private commercial office space rose by 0.3 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 0.2 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. For the full year, demand for private commercial office space grew by 0.4 per cent, lower than the 1.5 per cent increase in 2023 (Exhibit 6.24). \n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe real estate sector expanded by 3.5 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 1.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2024, the sector grew by 0.2 per cent, moderating from the 3.8 per cent growth in 2023. The professional services sector expanded by 0.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 1.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2024, the sector grew by 1.2 per cent, moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2023. \n\n2023 2024 012345678910 \n\nIV III II IIV \n\n> Thousand\n\n-3 -2 -1 01234567Per Cent Total Sales Private Residential Certified Payments (RHS) \n\n01234567\n\nIV III II IIV \n\n> Million Square Metre Nett\n\n2023 2024 Office Retail Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n72 \n\n# Chapter 6.10 Overall demand for private industrial space rose by 0.7 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 0.3 per cent increase seen in the previous quarter (Exhibit 6.25). Within the market, demand for all types of industrial space expanded during the fourth quarter. In particular, demand for business parks and warehouses increased by 2.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively in the fourth quarter, whereas demand for single-user factories and multiple-user factories increased by 0.7 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. For the full year, demand for private industrial space rose by 0.6 per cent, extending the 0.9 per cent growth seen in 2023. \n\n## PROFESSIONAL SERVICES \n\nIn 2024, the professional services sector expanded, with the accounting, head offices & business representative offices and management consultancy activities segments registering growth. Growth in the sector was largely driven by the head offices and business representative offices segment, which expanded by 4.3 per cent. \n\nExhibit 6.25: Total Occupied Space for Private Sector Industrial Space  \n\n> 2023 2024 36 37 38 39 40 41 42\n> IV III II IIV\n> Million Square Metres Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance\n\n73 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK CHAPTER \n\n# 7LEADING INDICATORS \n\nThe composite leading index (CLI) for Singapore fell by 0.8 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the fourth quarter of 2024, following the 0.1 per cent decline in the previous quarter (Exhibit 7.1). Of the nine components of the CLI, six components decreased on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the fourth quarter, namely the stock of finished goods, domestic liquidity, wholesale trade, non-oil sea cargo handled, new companies formed and non-oil retained imports. By contrast, the US Purchasing Managers’ Index, stock price and money supply rose compared to a quarter ago. \n\n## OUTLOOK FOR 2025 \n\nSince the Economic Survey of Singapore in November 2024, major economies have remained resilient, performing largely in line with expectations in the fourth quarter of 2024 amidst rising global economic uncertainty. Singapore’s external demand outlook for 2025 has also remained broadly unchanged, with overall GDP growth in Singapore’s key trading partners expected to ease from 2024’s level. Among the advanced economies, GDP growth in the US is projected to moderate in 2025, as private consumption growth is expected to taper over the course of the year in tandem with easing tightness in the labour market. Nonetheless, there is a large cone of uncertainty surrounding the outlook of the US economy, with its trajectory depending on the policies of the new US administration. By contrast, GDP growth in the Eurozone is likely to improve on the back of stronger consumption growth and a gradual recovery in investments as monetary policy becomes more accommodative. In Asia, China’s GDP growth is expected to moderate on account of a slowdown in merchandise exports and investment growth due to tariff hikes and industrial overcapacity respectively. Meanwhile, growth in the key Southeast Asian economies should remain steady, supported by improving domestic demand and a sustained recovery in tourism demand. At the same time, uncertainties in the global economy remain significant, with the risks tilted to the downside. First, ongoing trade frictions among major economies, alongside lingering risks of escalation in geopolitical conflicts, could lead to higher production costs, as well as greater global economic policy uncertainty. These could in turn dampen global investment and trade, and weigh on global growth. Second, disruptions to the global disinflation process could lead to tighter financial conditions for longer, potentially triggering latent vulnerabilities in banking and financial systems. \n\nExhibit 7.1: Composite Leading Index Levels and Growth Rate \n\n> 98 100 102 104 106 108 110 112 114\n> IV III II IIV III II IIV III II IIV III II I\n> 2015 = 100\n> 2024 2023 2022 2021\n> -30 -25 -20 -15 -10\n> -5 0510 Per Cent QoQ Change (RHS)\n\n# ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n76 \n\n# Chapter 7 Against this backdrop, the manufacturing and trade-related services sectors in Singapore are expected to continue to expand in 2025, although their pace of growth is likely to moderate from 2024 levels. Within the manufacturing sector, the electronics cluster is projected to expand at a steady pace, supported by robust demand for semiconductor chips in the PC, smartphone and data centre end-markets. This will have positive spillover effects on the precision engineering cluster and the machinery, equipment & supplies segment of the wholesale trade sector. At the same time, strong order books in the aerospace and marine & offshore engineering segments should drive growth in the transport engineering cluster. Meanwhile, outward-oriented services sectors such as information & communications and finance & insurance are projected to register healthy growth. The former will be supported by sustained enterprise demand for digital solutions and services, while the latter will be bolstered by stronger demand for cross-border transactions in the region, which will further boost payments processing activities. On the other hand, the growth of consumer-facing sectors such as retail trade and food & beverage services is likely to remain lacklustre, weighed down in part by locals shifting their spending overseas, even though the continued recovery in international visitor arrivals should provide some support. Taking into account the external and domestic economic environment, and barring the materialisation of downside risks, the Singapore economy is projected to expand by \n\n“1.0 to 3.0 per cent” in 2025.

Started by A*STAR in 2003, T-Up aims to help promising local small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as large local enterprises (LLEs) build in-house research and development (R&D) capabilities and grow their revenue, by enabling them to tap on A*STAR’s scientific talent pool. As part of the scheme, A*STAR researchers are seconded to participating local enterprises for up to two years to aid in their R&D projects (see Annex A for examples of these projects). Seconded researchers share product development strategy and impart knowledge in technical areas to support the firm in the development of new products and processes, as well as build up their intellectual property portfolio. At the same time, participating firms are provided funding support by Enterprise Singapore, at up to 70% of allowable costs for SMEs or startups and up to 30% for LLEs, with the support levels capped at S$250,000 per project. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the T-Up programme in enhancing firms’ outcomes in R&D, as well as their revenue, employment, value-added, productivity and wages. The rest of the article is organised as follows. We first present a literature review of the impact that the movement of researchers from public research institutions to private entities has on the private entities. We then describe the data and methodology used in the study before reporting the results. The final section concludes. \n\n## LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nIn the literature, technology transfer is generally seen as essential to boost firms’ competitiveness and foster innovation. Foundational research, which forms the basis of technological advancements, is often conducted by universities and public research institutions (Wrisich et al., 2016). Meanwhile, firms conducting R&D often face significant challenges, including high costs and uncertain outcomes. For SMEs in particular, these challenges are compounded by limited resources and constraints in their capacity to absorb complex technological advancements. To address the impediments to R&D in the private sector, government agencies often promote collaborations, such as through secondments, between public research institutions and the private sector (Hilkenmeier et al., 2021). These partnerships allow firms to adopt advanced technologies more quickly and enhance their overall innovative capacity. 1 We would like to thank Ms Yong Yik Wei, Dr Andy Feng, Ms Jamie Poh, Mr Lee Zen Wea, Dr Gwee Yi Jie and Dr Tan Yi Jin for their useful suggestions and comments. We are also grateful to colleagues from MTI’s Innovation, Research and Development Division, A*STAR as well as Enterprise Singapore for their input. \n\n# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nLaunched in 2003, the Technology for Enterprise Capability Upgrading (T-Up) programme is a secondment programme funded by Enterprise Singapore and administered by A*STAR, where A*STAR’s research scientists and engineers are seconded to local enterprises to help them build in-house research and development (R&D) capabilities and grow their business revenue. This study evaluates the impact of the T-Up programme on participating firms’ outcomes. \n\nOur findings show that firms participating in the T-Up programme spent 65.4 per cent more on R&D and were 8.4 percentage-points more likely to conduct R&D in a given year compared to a control group. They also correspondingly enjoyed 44.3 per cent higher revenue and 21.9 per cent higher employment than the control group. These findings suggest that the T-Up programme has been effective in supporting local firms to upgrade their R&D capabilities and grow their business revenue. Feature Article \n\n81 A review of the empirical literature highlights the positive outcomes of secondment policies and other initiatives involving the movement of researchers from public research institutions to private firms. For instance, Herrera (2010) found that Spanish firms that hired personnel from the public R&D system registered a 2.6 percentage-point (pp) increase in their total R&D intensity, measured as the ratio of total R&D expenditure to total sales. Hilkenmeier et al. (2021) surveyed firms that participated in a public-private partnership programme in Germany where scientists from a public research organisation were temporarily seconded to SMEs to jointly work on projects. The study found that apart from reporting technological advancements in their operations, the majority of the participating firms also engaged in follow-up projects as a result of the partnership. In the local context, an earlier evaluation of the T-Up programme by Ho et al. (2016) found that the seconded researchers imparted new technologies to the participating firms, and also improved the firms’ capacity for learning and innovation. In particular, the T-Up secondment improved firms’ product innovation intensity, which was measured as the percentage of sales derived from new products, by 3.2 per cent. This study extends Ho et al.’s 2016 study in two ways. First, while the previous study relied on survey data, this study leveraged firm-level administrative data, which in turn enabled more robust quantitative methods to be used and more firm outcomes of policy relevance to be examined. Second, this study tracked more recent cohorts of firms that participated in the T-Up programme (i.e., from 2011 to 2018), whereas the previous study covered firms that participated before 2012 when the scheme was at a more nascent stage. \n\n## DATA AND SUMMARY STATISTICS \n\nFor the purpose of our study, we merged three datasets: a longitudinal firm-level administrative dataset containing firms’ characteristics from the Department of Statistics, data on T-Up participants from A*STAR, and data on R&D conducted by firms in Singapore from A*STAR’s National Survey of Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2. The merged dataset contained firm-level data such as revenue, value-added, employment size and age of the firm, as well as R&D-related data 3 like firms’ R&D expenditure. Our study focused on firms that participated in the T-Up programme for the first time between 2011 and 2018. We examined cohorts up to 2018 because the firm-level administrative and A*STAR’s survey datasets at the point of the study were only available up to 2020. 4 This is particularly since the effects of R&D policies may take time to materialise. 5Based on the dataset assembled, a total of 161 firms participated in the T-Up programme between 2011 and 2018. The number ranged from 15 to 30 firms per year throughout the period of analysis, with an average of 20 firms per year (Exhibit 1). The data also showed that T-Up firms tended to be micro and small firms with annual revenue below S$10 million and fewer than 50 employees (Exhibit 2). 2 A*STAR’s National Survey of Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) is conducted annually and provides insights on Singapore’s R&D ecosystem, including information on the R&D performed by firms. 3 R&D-related data are from A*STAR’s RIE Survey, and are subject to entities’ responses. 4 In recent years, the archetype of firms participating in the T-Up programme has evolved, with more T-Up projects involving start-ups within the deep tech, artificial intelligence and biomedical space. However, as we were only able to study T-Up cohorts up to 2018, our results would not incorporate the effects of these recent shifts. 5 Moreover, while around 90% of the T-Up projects last for up to one year, there are some that could last for up to two years. Given that data on firms’ outcomes are only available up to 2020, the 2018 cohort would represent the latest cohort that could be studied.

In particular, compared to non-T-Up firms, T-Up firms had on average (i) higher employment, (ii) higher total R&D expenditure, but (iii) lower productivity (measured as value-added per worker). They were also more likely to be in the manufacturing sector. Given these differences, there is a need to mitigate potential selection biases when examining the impact of the T-Up programme in order to obtain a causal estimate of the impact. To do so, we constructed a group of non-participating firms (i.e., control firms) with characteristics that were comparable to the participating firms (i.e., treated firms) through coarsened exact matching (CEM), with the matching performed separately for each T-Up cohort. The matching variables used included the firm’s age, total R&D expenditure, value-added, value-added per worker, total employment and sector. 6 Exhibit 3 shows that upon matching, firms in the control group were observably more similar to the treated firms in terms of their characteristics. 6 For each cohort, the CEM algorithm was implemented using data in the year prior to the commencement of the T-Up project. For instance, 2014 data was used to identify a suitable control group for the 2015 cohort. 7 Summary statistics were generated based on the pooled data in the year before each cohort’s participation in T-Up (i.e., in the year used for matching). For instance, for the 2015 cohort, the summary statistics were generated using the corresponding data in 2014, as well as 2014 data for control firms. 8 This was preferred to the traditional DiD using two-way fixed effects as the latter could lead to biased estimates when there is staggered treatment timing and treatment heterogeneity across cohorts or time. \n\nBefore Matching After Matching Control Treated Control Treated Firm age (years) 10.9 11.5 12.5 12.4 \n\nTotal R&D expenditure (S$ Thousand) 45.2 222.9 155.7 187.5 \n\nValue-added (S$ Million) 2.1 6.1 2.7 2.2 \n\nValue-added per worker (S$ Thousand) 77.0 44.9 60.2 47.2 \n\nTotal employment 19.6 68.2 34.1 33.3 \n\nShare of manufacturing sector (%) 5.6 33.3 34.0 34.0 \n\nShare of professional services sector (%) 12.4 24.0 21.8 21.8 \n\nExhibit 3: Summary Statistics on Firm Characteristics Before and After Matching 7\n\nAs there were multiple treatment cohorts, we used a staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD) regression model (Wooldridge, 2021) to uncover the causal impact of the T-Up programme on firm outcomes. 8 Our main specification regression was as follows: \n\nY𝑖c t = γic + θtc + ∑ ∑ βc,t · Treat 𝑖 × Cohort c ×Time t + ε𝑖 ct \n\n> c=2011 2020 t=2010 2018\n\nWhere: \n\n• Y𝑖c t is the outcome variable for firm 𝑖 in cohort \n\nc at time \n\nt;\n\n• Treat 𝑖 × Cohort c × Time t is a dummy variable which takes on the value of 1 for the observation at year \n\nt for firm 𝑖 , if firm 𝑖 was treated at year c (i.e., treated firm belonging to cohort c); \n\n• γic denotes the firm × cohort time-invariant fixed effects; \n\n• θtc denotes the year × cohort fixed effects; and \n\n• ε𝑖c t is the error term assumed to be uncorrelated with the independent variable in all time periods. We included firm fixed effects to account for time-invariant firm characteristics (including those not observed in the dataset) that could affect firms’ outcomes (e.g., managerial practices). We also included time fixed effects to control for factors that affected all firms over time (e.g., macroeconomic conditions). The firm and time fixed effects were interacted with cohort fixed effects to ensure that the comparisons were made between treated and control firms within cohorts. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n84 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nThe empirical strategy outlined above would be valid only if the trends in the outcomes of the T-Up firms were similar to those of the control firms in the years before the T-Up firms received treatment (i.e., the parallel trends assumption holds). We conducted a parallel trends test to examine this. The second column in Exhibit 4 below shows that none of the outcome variables have statistically significant coefficients in the one to three years before T-Up participation (i.e., τ < 0), indicating that the treatment and control firms displayed similar trends in outcomes prior to the treatment firms’ participation in T-Up. The coefficients of interest, βc,t s, measure the causal impact of the T-Up programme on the outcomes of firms in cohort \n\nc at year t, relative to the base year of 2009. We aggregated combinations of βc,t into event-time (i.e., the time relative to the start year of the project) average treatment effects (ATEs). Specifically, to get the ATE for the year after treatment had started (i.e., the causal impact one year after the firm had started participating in the programme, which we denoted as τ = 1 ), or βτ=1 , we took the average of the coefficients βc=2011,t=2012 , βc=2012,t=2013 , … , βc=2018,t=2019 . Repeating this for different event-times will give us a set of event-time coefficients βτ.We present the results as the averages of several event-time coefficients in Exhibit 4. For example, in the third column, \n\nβτ=0 to 3 is the average of βτ=0 ,…, βτ=3 , which reflects the average annual effect of the T-Up programme from the year of commencement of the T-Up project (i.e., τ = 0 ) to three years after commencement (i.e., τ = 3 ). Likewise, in the fourth column, βτ=0 to 5 shows the average annual effect from the year of commencement of the T-Up project to five years after commencement. \n\n(1) (2) (3) (4) Dependent Variable -3 to -1 years \n\n(β τ=-3 to-1 )\n\n0 to 3 years \n\n(β τ=0 to 3 )\n\n0 to 5 years \n\n(β τ=0 to 5 )\n\nR&D Outcomes \n\nWhether the firm did R&D -4.3pp 8.4pp** 8.9pp** Total R&D expenditure -43.2% 65.4%* 73.2%** Whether the firm filed any patents 0.5pp 1.0pp 0.6pp Patents -0.053 0.054 0.015 Revenue from R&D commercialisation 24.5% 63.5%* 71.8%** \n\nOther Firm Outcomes \n\nRevenue 16.0% 44.3%*** 44.5%*** Total employment 5.5% 21.9%*** 21.8%*** Value-added 12.5% 15.3% 13.5% Value-added per worker 6.6% 0.1% 0.8% Average local wages 4.4% 5.3% 3.3% \n\nExhibit 4: Regression Results \n\n> *, ** and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively\n\nThe results suggest that the T-Up programme had a positive and significant impact on participating firms’ outcomes. 9For the R&D-related outcomes up to three years after starting the T-Up project, we found that the T-Up programme was associated with positive and significant effects on firms’ R&D expenditure. These effects occurred at both the intensive margin – R&D expenditure was 65.4 per cent higher, and extensive margin – the probability of conducting R&D in a given year was 8.4pp higher. Similarly, T-Up firms saw 63.5 per cent higher revenue derived from commercialised products, suggesting that the R&D efforts led to successful commercialisation. The effects on patents-related outcomes were also positive, although not statistically significant. 9 These findings were robust to the inclusion of additional control variables such as other government grants and firm age, different matching specifications, different transformations of the dependent variable (e.g., logs, levels), as well as different specifications of the staggered DiD regressions proposed in the literature (e.g., Callaway and Sant’Anna, 2021). Feature Article \n\n85 In terms of other firm outcomes up to three years after starting the T-Up project, our findings suggest that firms that participated in T-Up had higher revenue (44.3 per cent) and total employment 10 (21.9 per cent) than non-participating firms. While the effects on value-added, value-added per worker and average local wages were positive, they were not statistically significant. Finally, we found that the effects on both R&D-related and other firm outcomes persisted up to five years after the firm started participating in the T-Up programme. 11 \n\n## CONCLUSION \n\nThis study found that the T-Up programme was effective in helping local firms to upgrade their R&D capabilities and grow their business revenue. In particular, participating in T-Up led to improvements in a number of outcomes for the firms, including R&D expenditure, revenue from commercialised products due to R&D, total revenue and total employment. Given these encouraging results, and T-Up’s contribution to RIE 2025’s goal of developing Singapore into an innovation-driven economy, A*STAR will continue to support firms in enhancing their R&D capabilities through T-Up and other R&D-related schemes.

These programmes help employers broaden their talent pool by reskilling mid-career new hires or existing employees into growth job roles with good longer-term prospects, with salary support of up to 90 per cent. 2 The duration of CCPs (typically spanning from three to 24 months) varies according to programme specifications and job requirements. Under the Place-and-Train (PnT) CCP, a company hires a jobseeker and puts him/her through on-the-job training or industry-recognised training to take on a new growth job role that aligns with its business and workforce transformation needs. This study examined the impact of the PnT CCP on the key labour market outcomes (i.e., wages, employment retention) of participants. The rest of the article is organised as follows. We first provide a brief review of the literature relating to active labour market policies (ALMPs). We then describe the data and methodology employed for our study, before reporting our findings. The final section concludes. \n\n## LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nALMPs are government policies aimed at assisting and incentivising individuals to actively look for work and find suitable employment. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), there are four main categories of ALMPs: (i) employment subsidies, (ii) self-employment/start-up support, (iii) training, and (iv) public work/public sector jobs. 3 The efficacy of ALMPs has been extensively studied in the literature, with findings generally indicating positive labour market outcomes for individuals over the medium to long run. 1 We would like to thank Ms Yong Yik Wei, Dr Kuan Ming Leong and Mr Alphonsus Gomez for their useful suggestions and comments. We are also grateful to WSG for their inputs to this study. All remaining errors belong to the authors. 2 Long-term unemployed or/and mature jobseekers aged 40 and above are eligible for higher funding support of 90%. 3 See OECD (2018) for more details. \n\n# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nWorkforce Singapore’s (WSG) Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) are placement-centric programmes that aim to address structural mismatches in the labour market. Under the Place-and-Train (PnT) CCP, a company hires a jobseeker and puts him/her through on-the-job training or industry-recognised training to take on a new growth job role that aligns with its business and workforce transformation needs. \n\nOur study evaluated the impact of the PnT CCP and found that it improved the labour market outcomes of participants. Specifically, the PnT CCP (i) increased participants’ wages by 2.5 per cent in the year of placement, with the impact rising further to 5.8 per cent to 6.5 per cent in the subsequent four years, and (ii) improved their employment retention by 3.9 percentage-points, compared to their control groups. Notably, the PnT CCP had a stronger impact on non-PMET and mature workers who were found to have benefitted more from the placement and accompanying training. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of rapid technological change, these findings suggest that schemes that target structural mismatches (including WSG’s PnT CCP) play a key role in addressing skills gaps and helping workers to take on growth job opportunities. By aligning talent with industry needs through the CCPs, workers can be empowered to pivot into future-ready roles, thereby enhancing their adaptability and resilience in a fast-evolving and dynamic Singapore economy. Feature Article \n\n91 Exhibit 1: Share of PMET and Mature Participants by Cohort, 2017-2022 \n\nFor instance, Vooren et al. (2019) examined 57 ALMP studies in OECD countries and found that training programmes had a positive impact on wages, employment probability and employment duration around six to 36 months after the start of the programme. Similarly, Card et al. (2018) found that training and retraining programmes had positive effects on wages, employment probability and employment duration around one to three years after programme completion. Estimating the impact of job placement programmes on participants with higher earnings, Autor et al. (2017) found that direct-hire placements significantly increased earnings over one to two years for half or more of all placed participants. \n\n## DATA AND SUMMARY STATISTICS \n\nThis study merged two key data sources: (i) data on participants placed in WSG’s PnT CCP from 2017 to 2022 and (ii) an individual-level administrative dataset containing information on the demographic characteristics, employment history and wages of all resident employees in Singapore. 4 We excluded participants with less than three months of employment records in the company they were placed in given that the typical PnT CCP duration exceeded three months. Consequently, our final sample comprised over 17,900 PnT participants placed between 2017 and 2022. Most PnT participants were (i) placed in Professional, Manager, Executive and Technician (PMET) roles and (ii) under 40 years of age (i.e., non-mature workers) (Exhibit 1). In particular, the share of PnT participants placed in PMET roles ranged from 74 per cent to 92 per cent between 2017 and 2022. Across the years, the share of mature workers remained relatively stable at around 40 per cent. 4 We used data from 2014 to 2023 from the individual-level administrative dataset to match PnT CCP participants with a control group of non-participants based on pre-placement characteristics, as well as to track their outcomes over time. More details can be found in the ‘Methodology’ section. Between 2017 and 2022, most PnT participants enrolled in programmes that lasted six to 11 months (41-63 per cent) or less than six months (32-43 per cent) (Exhibit 2). Programmes with a duration of 12 months or more had fewer participants. Over the period, the share of participants enrolled in longer programmes fell as WSG sharpened its focus towards shorter programmes that could more nimbly support businesses’ hiring and reskilling needs.               \n\n> 73.6% 77.8% 77.4% 77.6% 79.8% 91.9% 41.5% 40.2% 41.9% 42.5% 41.0% 35.9% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 PMET Participants Mature Participants\n> Source: MOM Economic Survey of Singapore 2024\n\n92 METHODOLOGY \n\nTo estimate the causal impact of the PnT CCP, we combined matching methods with a difference-in-differences (DiD) regression analysis. This multi-step approach allowed us to compare the wage and employment retention outcomes of two groups of individuals: a “treated” group that participated in the PnT CCP and an observably-similar “control” group that did not participate in the PnT CCP. First, to study the impact of the PnT CCP on wage outcomes, we used Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) to find a group of non-participants who was similar in observable characteristics to each cohort of PnT participants. The matched characteristics included age, gender, firm size, sector of employment, and employment history (i.e., wages and number of months worked over the past three years) in the year prior to each cohort’s placement in the programme. 5 The CEM technique enabled the construction of matched control groups that were comparable to the PnT participants. Second, after matching, we performed the following DiD regression, separately for each cohort, to study the impact of the PnT CCP on the wage outcomes of participants: 5 For each cohort, the CEM algorithm was implemented using data in the year before each cohort’s placement (e.g., for the 2019 cohort, data from 2018 was used to identify a suitable non-participant group). \n\nExhibit 2: Share of PnT Participants with Different Training Durations by Cohort, 2017-2022                      \n\n> 34% 41% 35% 32% 41% 43% 41% 42% 54% 63% 51% 51% 25% 17% 11% 5% 8% 6% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 <6 Months 6-11 Months 12 Months & Above\n> Source: MOM\n\nWhere: \n\n• Y𝑖 t represents the log mean monthly wage for individual 𝑖 in calendar year \n\nt;\n\n• Treated 𝑖 is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if individual 𝑖 is treated (i.e., a PnT participant); \n\n• year t are the dummies from year c-3 (three years before placement) to c+6 (up to six years after placement) for cohort c;\n\n• α𝑖 are the individual fixed effects; \n\n• δt are the time fixed effects; \n\n• X𝑖 t are the time-varying covariates (e.g., age, number of months worked, firm size and sector of employment); and \n\n• ε𝑖 t is the regression error term. \n\nY𝑖 t = α𝑖 + δt + ∑ βt Treated 𝑖 × year t + X𝑖 t + ε𝑖 t\n\n> t=c-3\n> c+6 Feature Article\n\n93 6 In the absence of treatment (i.e., placement in CCP), outcomes for the treatment and control groups should follow the same trend over time. 7 The PnT CCP typically lasts for three to 24 months, with the placement month considered as month 0. Therefore, for a training programme with a three-month duration, the first month after the training would be three months after placement. The pre-treatment coefficients βc-3 and βc-2 were used to test for pre-treatment trends and should be small and/or not statistically significant to support the parallel trends assumption. 6 The post-treatment coefficients βc, … βc+6 indicated the impact of the programme on wages in the year of treatment up to six years post-treatment. Third, to examine the effect on employment retention from the start of placement, we identified a control group of individuals who had similarly begun a new job at around the same time as the PnT participants were placed in the programme. Specifically, we matched all PnT participants to non-participants based on the month and year of the latter’s first instance of a job switch within the period studied (i.e., 2017 to 2022), in addition to the characteristics used in the earlier CEM matching. Fourth, we performed a probit regression to compare the probability of remaining in employment for the PnT participants and their matched counterparts. We estimated the probability of remaining in employment (i.e., βm) in each month after placement or upon taking on a new job (i.e., starting from three to 24 months 7 after placement or taking on a new job) using the following probit regression: \n\nPr (Y𝑖 m) = βm Treated 𝑖 + X𝑖 + ε𝑖 \n\nWhere: \n\n• Y𝑖 m is a dummy variable for whether individual 𝑖 remains in employment m months after placement / taking on a new job; \n\n• Treated 𝑖 is the dummy variable taking the value of 1 if individual 𝑖 is treated (i.e., a PnT participant); \n\n• X𝑖 are the individual’s characteristics in the year before placement / taking on a new job (e.g., age, number of months worked, firm size and sector of employment, month-year of job switch); and \n\n• ε𝑖 is the regression error term. Finally, we performed heterogeneity analyses to examine whether there were differences in the wage outcomes of PMET compared to non-PMET PnT participants, as well as mature compared to non-mature PnT participants, following the methodology described in the first and second steps. \n\n## RESULTS \n\nWe found that the PnT CCP increased the wages of participants across all cohorts. Specifically, the PnT CCP raised the wages of participants by 2.5 per cent on average in the year of placement, with the impact rising further to 5.8 per cent to 6.5 per cent in the subsequent four years (Exhibit 3). These results were robust to running a stacked regression, with each cohort’s dataset stacked together to form a combined dataset.

On average, the retention rate for PnT participants was 3.9 percentage-points (pp) higher than that of non-participants. The difference in retention rate was the largest, at about 4.7pp, around six months after placement. Even at the 24-month mark, the employment retention rate for PnT participants (90.3 per cent) remained 3.7pp higher than that for non-participants (86.6 per cent) (Exhibit 4). \n\nExhibit 3: Average Impact of the PnT CCP on Wages by Years Post-Placement \n\n> Source: Authors’ estimates Notes: The parallel trend assumption was met for all cohorts. Post-treatment coefficients for each cohort were statistically significant at the 1% level. The average wage effects for five and six years post-placement were omitted from Exhibit 3, as only at most two cohorts (i.e., 2017 and 2018) had available data to reach these points of time.\n\nExhibit 4: Retention Rate for PnT Participants and Non-Participants \n\n97.5% 93.6% 92.0% 90.3% 92.7% 89.8% 88.5% 86.6% 75% 80% 85% 90% 95% 100% 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Number of Months Post Placement PnT Participants Matched Control Average difference from 3 to 24 months = 3.9pp 4.7pp 3.8pp 3.4pp 3.7pp \n\n> Source: Authors’ estimates\n\nFeature Article \n\n95 Finally, our heterogeneity analyses highlighted that the impact of the PnT CCP differed across occupational (PMET and non-PMET) and demographic (mature and non-mature) groups, even though participation in the programme benefitted all groups. Notably, the PnT CCP had a stronger impact on non-PMET and mature (aged 40 years and above) workers, who were found to benefit more from the placement and accompanying training. In the four years post-placement, non-PMET PnT participants experienced stronger wage gains (approximately 2pp higher) than PMET PnT participants (Exhibit 5). The PnT CCP likely assisted non-PMET workers to switch into growth job roles with more potential, leading to better outcomes in wages. Similarly, mature PnT participants saw stronger wage increases (approximately 3.1pp higher) than their non-mature counterparts (Exhibit 6). The higher salary support for mature workers likely incentivised businesses to hire and train mature workers previously in lower-potential jobs, who then benefitted from a larger wage uplift in their new growth job roles. \n\nExhibit 5: Average Impact of the PnT CCP on Wages in the Four Years Post-Placement by Participants’ Broad Occupation Exhibit 6: Average Impact of the PnT CCP on Wages in the Four Years Post-Placement by Participants’ Age Group   \n\n> 7.0% 5.0% 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% Non-PMET Partipicants PMET Participants 2pp 8.8% 5.7% 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% Mature Participants Non-Mature Participants 3.1pp\n\n## CONCLUSION \n\nIn summary, our study found that the PnT CCP improved participants’ labour market outcomes. Reflecting the programme’s effectiveness in reskilling workers for new job roles, PnT participants experienced higher wages and employment retention. In particular, the PnT CCP was found to have a stronger beneficial impact on non-PMET and mature workers. The positive outcomes of the PnT CCP underscore the significance of subsidised on-the-job training in Singapore’s skills development landscape. Against the backdrop of rapid technological change, these findings suggest that schemes that target structural mismatches (including WSG’s PnT CCP) play a key role in addressing skills gaps and helping workers to take on growth job opportunities. Recognising the importance of CCPs, WSG increased the CCP salary support caps in April 2024 to keep pace with rising wages and maintain the programme’s attractiveness to employers, which would in turn help more workers take up more productive job roles and create more career conversion opportunities. 8 By aligning talent with industry needs through CCPs, workers can be empowered to pivot into future-ready roles, thereby enhancing their adaptability and resilience in a fast-evolving and dynamic Singapore economy. Source: Authors’ estimates 8 From 1 April 2024, the PnT CCP supported: (i) up to 90% of monthly salary (capped at $7,500 per month) for long-term unemployed or/and mature (40 years and above) Singapore residents, and (ii) up to 70% of monthly salary (capped at $5,000 per month) for other Singapore residents. Previously, the monthly salary caps were $6,000 and $4,000 respectively.

Multinational companies (MNCs) play a significant role in our economic development.\nLast year, MNCs committed S$11.8 billion in fixed asset investments and S$7 billion in annual business expenditure. These investments are expected to create 16,100 skilled jobs. MNCs also helped to anchor and grow key new sectors, such as clean technology.\nOur small and medium enterprises (SMEs), too, have benefitted as suppliers and subcontractors to MNCs. The Economic Development Board’s Partnerships for Capability Transformation scheme has also helped MNCs to transfer technological capabilities to SMEs.\nAs in many other countries, tax incentives support Singapore’s economic growth and promote investment. The incentives are granted to companies with substantive economic activities here, which will add value significantly to our economy and create employment.\nIncentive recipients are subject to audits to ensure commitments are met, and programmes are reviewed regularly. Besides tax incentives, MNCs are attracted by Singapore’s strategic location, strong connectivity, trusted legal and regulatory framework, and talent pool.\nWhile MNCs play an important role in our economy, the Government remains committed to supporting our SMEs. Last year, Spring Singapore assisted more than 9,000 SMEs through some 12,000 upgrading projects to boost productivity and competitiveness and capture growth opportunities.\nTogether with its partners, Spring also reached out to some 160,000 SMEs last year with other forms of assistance such as business advisory services and toolkits. Similarly, International Enterprise Singapore helped 22,400 SMEs in their overseas expansion last year.\nWe will continue to work with industry partners to create an environment conducive to doing business for both SMEs and MNCs.\nMrs Cindy Keng\nDirector, Corporate Communications Division\nMinistry of Trade and Industry\nShare Article\n[No Text]

During the late 1950s and 1960s, the population had increased substantially and the government had to relocate the growing population from overcrowded squatter villages to new HDB housing estates. Land was also required for industrial development, and construction of roads, schools, community and recreational facilities.\n3\nPrior to the Land Acquisition Act, the government’s ability to acquire private land was governed by the Land Acquisition Ordinance, 1955. Although the Land Acquisition Ordinance empowered the government to acquire private land compulsorily for public projects, it did not prevent landowners from increasing the prices of their lands in an area earmarked for such projects.\n4\nAs a result, this raised the land acquisition cost and made low-cost public projects difficult or impossible.\n5\nTo prevent landowners from making unreasonable profits out of land to be acquired for public development, the government introduced the Land Acquisition Bill, which was approved by parliament on 26 October 1966.\n6\nThe Land Acquisition Act came into effect on 17 June the following year. Any dispute over the compensation amount was referred to an Appeals Board.\n7\nThe act also widened the government’s powers of acquisition to meet various situations arising from the ongoing urban renewal and industrialisation programmes as well as in cases of extreme urgency.\n8\nBiggest landowner\nThe 1967 Land Acquisition Act enabled the government to step up its land acquisition programme. Between 1959 and 1984, the government acquired a total of 43,713 acres of land, which constituted about one-third of the total land area of Singapore at the time.\n9\nThe bulk of this land bank was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act after 1967.\n10\nThe government became the biggest landowner by 1985, owning 76.2 percent of land in Singapore, more than double the 31 percent in 1949.\n11\nBetween 1963 and 1985, the HDB constructed over 500,000 flats to provide accommodation at affordable prices for over 80 percent of Singapore’s total population.\n12\nThe JTC was able to establish 20 industrial estates, including the 6,500-ha Jurong Industrial Estate by the end of 1985. In total, there were some 3,070 factories in the estates employing about 217,000 workers or 70 percent of Singapore’s manufacturing workforce.\n13\nBesides allowing the construction of affordable housing and industrial estates, cheaper and more effective land acquisition also permitted better urban planning. This benefited the redevelopment plans of the URA and its predecessor, the Urban Redevelopment Department, in the central area, leading to the growth of the commercial and business district in downtown Singapore.\n14\nAuthors\nShaun Oon & Lim Tin Seng\nReferences\n1. “\nNew Land Acquisition Law Comes into Effect (http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19670617-1.2.37)\n,”\nStraits Times\n, 17 June 1967, 7; Ngiam Tong Dow, “\nTaking Over Private Turf for Public’s Good (http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/today20070202-2.2.9.9)\n,”\nToday,\n2 February 2007, 12. (From NewspaperSG)\n2. Ngiam, “\nTaking Over Private Turf (http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/today20070202-2.2.9.9)\n.”\n3. N.

The act also regulated the amount of compensation to be given to landowners who had their properties acquired by the government.\n[2] (https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#2)\nThe Land Acquisition Act was passed by parliament on 26 October 1966 and came into effect on 17 June the following year. Any disputes between the government and landowners over the compensation amounts were presided over by an Appeals Board.\n[3] (https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#3)\nTo further expedite government developmental projects through land acquisition, the act was amended in 1973 in order to curb land speculation and limit the cost of land acquisition. The revised act fixed the compensation amount for acquired land at the market value as at 30 November 1973 or at the date of gazette notification, whichever was lower.\n[4] (https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#4)\nThe Land Acquisition Act expedited the process of land possession by the government for public purposes. Between 1959 and 1984, the government acquired a total of 43,713 acres (17,690 ha or 177 sq km) of land, which constituted about one-third of the total land area of Singapore then.\n[5] (https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#5)\nThe bulk of land, however, was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act after 1967.\n[6] (https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#6)\nWith an increase in acquired land parcels, the government became the biggest landowner by 1985. At the time, the government owned 76.2 percent of the land in Singapore compared with 31 percent in 1949.\n[7] (https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#7)\nThe compulsory acquisition of land by the government was effective in keeping the costs of building houses and industrial premises affordable.\n[8] (https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#8)\nCheaper and more effective land acquisition also resulted in better urban planning that facilitated the urban renewal efforts carried out by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and its predecessor the Urban Renewal Department in the central area, which led to the growth of the commercial and business district in downtown Singapore.\n[9] (https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#9)\nReferences\n1.

Already, GBA is Greater China’s most economically prosperous region and has already reported a gross domestic product equivalent to Italy’s at $2.36 trillion.\nMany international and Asian businesses, as well as start-up companies are flocking over to GBA to capitalise on the region’s growth potential and to be at the forefront of change, innovation and technology hub. Each city within GBA has something unique to offer as well, which appeals to a wide variety of organisations that are looking to centralise and consolidate their research and development (R&D) efforts, high-quality manufacturing and investments in Asia.\nA former British colony, Hong Kong SAR is a multi-national city that bridges the east and west. A city that prides itself on its bilingual and international talent pool, the financial hub helps facilitate the financial interest and business commercialisation within GBA as well as with the Asia Pacific and the western markets. The\nWealth Management Connect (https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/wealth/china-kick-off-long-awaited-wealth-connect-wrapping-hk-macau-2021-09-10/)\nthat was introduced in September 2021 will bring an estimated combined fund flows valued at $46 billion to the region.\nAs one of the largest and fastest-growing economies in China, Guangdong is home to Shenzhen province as well as Zhuhai and Shantou, which makes it the perfect sandbox destination for companies to drive innovation as well as manufacture new products and services. The highly-innovative ecosystem has attracted direct investment from entrepreneurs from all over the world to kick-start and commercialise their ideas and concepts.\nWhile GBA is also known to be an innovation hub that offers great business opportunities and a promising growth journey for everyone, it actually has a fairly targeted approach. In other words, their eyes are set on the prize. GBA also allows business leaders to tap on world-class talent and their schemes have been largely focused on specific sectors, which include emerging technologies such as healthtech, artificial intelligence and robotics, biotechnology and smart manufacturing. Infrastructure projects have also been designed to increase connectivity between the provinces to create a smart city network to facilitate a seamless flow of communication and talent.\nRandstad Greater China’s recruitment strategies are aligned with the GBA developments and goals as well. In particular, we invest in enhancing our recruitment efforts and HR solutions to provide world-class services in areas such as R&D, technology developments as well as sales & marketing. Within the R&D industry, Randstad recruiters are a strategic partner and specialised in supporting the human capital developments in semiconductor and smart manufacturing to drive technological innovation.\nEven as China is on a growth trajectory to overtake the U.S. as the largest economy in the world, organisations continue to face persistent challenges that hinder their growth - and one of them is talent.\ntalent schemes to help organisations attract new talent to GBA\nThe governments have implemented new talent schemes and policies to support the organisations’ recruitment efforts of hiring skilled talent in GBA. The\nTechnology Talent Admission Scheme (https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/TECHTAS.html)\n(TechTAS) that was introduced in 2020 aims to fast-track approvals for companies to admit non-local technology talent for R&D roles in Hong Kong SAR. Similarly, the\nQuality Migrant Admission Scheme (https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/quality_migrant_admission_scheme.html)\nprovides companies more flexibility to hire experienced professionals with in-demand expertise and skills to work in the city.\nThe Chinese government has also revised the individual income tax rate from 45% to 15% for eligible foreign talent to attract more professionals to move to GBA for work. This 30% reduction in income tax would be a useful persuasion tool that employers can use to attract more talent from other mainland China cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, as well as expatriate workers from Singapore, Canada and Australia to relocate to GBA.\nThese grants and schemes go a long way to attract new talent to move to GBA. However, the onus is on the employers to ensure that they fulfill the last mile job match by engaging workers in interesting job content, meaningful work and useful employee benefits to retain them in GBA.\nwhile high salaries and bonuses are attractive, candidates want more than that\nBeing faced with the persistent challenge of being able to attract and retain skilled talent, many employers are offering jobs that often come with high salaries and bonuses. For instance, many organisations are willing to pay above market average for talent who are trilingual, have a wide network of customers in Greater China or are equipped with niche skills such as data sciences, software engineering and manufacturing technology.\nHowever, that may not be enough to persuade candidates to take up a job in GBA.\nCandidates’ expectations of what constitutes a good employer have become more complex over the years. The concept of loyally working in the same job from 9 to 5 every day for years no longer applies in modern society. A pay that is simply above the market rate may not be the only factor to workers now. The dynamic between talent and employers has shifted significantly over the last two years, and there is a heightened sense of purpose that now guides people’s career choices and the work they choose to do.\nIn the 2022 Randstad\nWorkmonitor Survey (https://www.randstad.com/workforce-insights/global-hr-research/randstad-workmonitor/)\n, 33% of respondents working in Asia Pacific markets said that they have quit a job because it doesn’t fit into their personal lives. Workers in the Asia Pacific region were more likely to reject job offers if these didn’t include flexible hours (cited by 44%) or remote options (43%). More than half (56%) of respondents in mainland China held such sentiments regarding remote working, and nearly as many (49%) felt this way about flexible hours.To attract the right talent, business leaders and employers must play an active role in meeting candidate expectations and development to support their workforce in achieving their career plan.\nimprove diversity and social cohesion to improve GBA’s ability to retain workforce\nThe GBA may have a huge market potential, but the lack of diversity that has resulted in putting lives at risk can be tracked as far back as to an invention in 1959 - the car seat belt. In the past, companies only used “male” crash test dummies, which are manufactured using the weight, height and physics of an average male. It was not until 2004 when “female” crash test dummies were deployed, and even so, they are usually just a smaller size dummy that does not take into account the female anatomy.\nDiversity and social cohesion are key ingredients of a flourishing innovation economy. As a melting pot of cultures, GBA offers more than just the tremendous opportunities for business developments and it is up to companies and employees to discover and take advantage of that.\nA diverse population is an important asset for businesses as employers will have access to a greater range of talent who would have insights into the motivations and demands of your stakeholders and customer base. As with the example of the car seat belt, companies with a diverse workforce would be able to commercialise a service or product that will be more relevant and useful to a larger population, leading to a more successful and profitable business.\nSocial cohesion is another area where companies in GBA need to work together on. Social cohesion is the “glue” that brings workers together and it helps to lessen the frictions that are often associated with management changes. It is more than just about “getting along” with one another, but being able to truly understand each other’s motivations, characteristics and challenges. When employees recognise their similarities and acknowledge their differences, they are more likely to support one another and collaborate to overcome barriers together as a team.\nRight now, companies in GBA are not actively integrating their talent to the community and in the workplace. This would come as a culture shock to expatriates who have relocated for work, as many may feel lonely if they don’t have the opportunity to build meaningful relationships with their co-workers or find a purpose for continuing their careers in GBA.\nEmployers play a key role and need to purposefully develop and implement HR policies and initiatives that are designed to help bring their people together to find commonalities and similarities with one another. Company events and offsites are a great way to do that. Leisure activities help employees relax and let their hair down, and create a chance for them to know one another on a more personal level. Companies can also use this as an opportunity to reward and recognise their employees’ contributions.\nAnother way to build social cohesion is through collaborations and mentorship programmes. The\nInnoLife Healthtech Hub (https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2021/10/20211007/20211007_160546_947.html)\nand\nYouth Employment Scheme (https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/opportunities/youth.html)\nprovides companies in GBA the opportunities to collaborate with local universities and scientific research institutions to drive R&D and innovation. Organisations that offer holistic coaching programmes and exciting avenues for employees to work on innovative projects together are more likely to be able to build a more collective and socially cohesive workforce.\nzero-COVID strategy will continue to present hurdles for organisations, but it won’t stop them from hiring more talent\nCertain provinces of Greater China may still be in lockdown or face tight measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 when this article is published. The zero-COVID policy, if continued as other countries open up - could diminish the benefits and significance of a highly-connected network of cities, as talent will not be able to travel freely between the two special administrative regions and the nine cities in Guangdong.\nFlexible work arrangement is an employee benefit that underlines a greater human need - the freedom to work wherever they want, whenever they want. Travel bubbles that use strict testing regimes to replace quarantine requirements between the GBA cities could help facilitate a seamless flow of communication and talent, which would create more business avenues and improve social cohesion.\nUntil then, organisations will continue their relentless pursuit of attracting skilled talent from all around the world to GBA to drive innovation and business growth.\ndownload the PDF file (https://www.randstad.com.hk/s3fs-media/hk/public/2022-07/randstad-hong-kong-greater-bay-area-generation-talent-innovation-asia.pdf)\nwork with randstad\nIf finding high performing leaders and talent remains a key challenge for you,\nreach us out (https://www.randstad.com.hk/employers/hr-solutions/)\nto help you find the best talent for your future workforce.

thing’\nThe Greater Bay Area: China’s ‘next big thing’\n港珠澳大桥-粤港界\nAlfonso Ballesteros\nPosted on 28 Jul 2022 //\nChina, the US and the new world order (https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/topic/china-the-us-and-the-new-world-order/)\nThe South China Morning Post\n, Hong Kong’s most prestigious newspaper has defined the Greater Bay Area project as ‘The next big thing’ for China. However, few people outside Asia are aware of what the project really entails.\nThe Greater Bay Area (or GBA)\nis a Chinese government project to connect 11 cities in the South of China (https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/chinas-growing-assertiveness-in-the-south-china-sea/)\n: Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Macau plus another seven supporting cities on Mainland China into a single economic and business hub. With an area slightly larger than the Netherlands, a population greater than Germany and a GDP equivalent to South Korea, the block has a larger economy than either Spain or Russia. If it were a country, it would be among the world’s top 10 economies.\nThe GBA project is one of the most notable developments in the global economic playing field. It can be better understood as part of a push to make China a technological powerhouse. It brings together the factory of the world (Guangzhou),\nChina’s Silicon Valley (Shenzhen), (https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/investing-in-china-still-room-for-growth/)\none of the world’s main financial centres (Hong Kong), the ‘Las Vegas of Asia’ (Macau) and a hinterland of various industrial cities, all within a short distance of each other, to create a megalopolis of 86 million people. China’s plan is to turn the region into a new engine for growth and innovation with a GDP that could reach the size of Germany’s in less than 20 years and set the standards in many advanced industries, such as 6G, AI, FinTech, Smart Cities, robotics, biotech and ESG, among others.\nThis is the continuation of the type of initiatives that have made China into what it is today. In fact, Shenzhen was the first Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in China, the testing ground that served as an example for other similar experiments throughout the country and that brought\nabout China’s economic miracle (https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/archive/opinion/china-has-changed-the-global-economic-order-with-the-help-of-europe/)\n. Shenzhen was chosen for its proximity to Hong Kong. The then British colony played a key role as a source of investment and knowhow that helped propel Shenzhen from a town of barely 50,000 people to the sprawling metropolis of 12 million that it is today. Meanwhile, the entire Guangdong province experienced an accelerated process of industrialisation that turned it into ‘the factory of the World’. Now, 40 years after those initial reforms, China is betting once again on the Hong Kong-Shenzhen-Guangzhou connection to propel itself into the next stage of development to become a fully developed economy.\nThe GBA is trying to achieve several key objectives at once. On the one hand, China is now an upper-middle income country with a slowing economic growth and a rapidly ageing population, which is a dangerous situation to be in. Despite the economic successes of the past decades, there is a risk it could fall into the middle-income trap. China is well aware of this and is trying to avoid such a situation by boosting high value-added industries and international projection. This helps explain the connection with the other key elements of its strategy for the coming decades: Made in China 2025, China Standards 2035, the Belt and Road Initiative,\nthe dual circulation development paradigm and the internationalisation of the yuan (RMB). (https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/rmb-internationalization-and-the-bri-reality-or-fantasy/)\nThey are all different aspects of one overarching effort to avoid the middle-income trap, set China at the forefront of innovation and technology and guarantee its commercial and technological self-reliance. There is also one more layer: the further integration of both Hong Kong and Macao into southern China, reinterpreting their relationship with the mainland. If fully realised, this vision has the potential to completely change the face of the region.\nIn fact, the development of the GBA is accorded the status of a key strategic plan in the country’s development blueprint and is expected to play a pivotal role under the current Five-Year Plan (2021-25). It is a vital topic of discussion and is contemplated as a priority by all levels of the administration and across the business world. So much so that the powerful National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)\nhas created a special fund from the Central Government’s Budget (https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/the-new-silk-road-grand-geopolitical-engineering/)\nto directly finance some of the most ambitious projects in the GBA. The fund will complement the municipal and regional level budget allocations.\nThe GBA project involves promoting integration across many fronts: infrastructure, legislation, visas, taxation, work permits, company set-ups and stock exchange connections. In all, there are 12 official policy areas. While integrating the nine mainland Chinese cities presents relatively minor difficulties, successfully integrating Hong Kong and Macao into the mix is a very different story. The former European colonies have their own official languages as well as their own political, legal, monetary and financial systems and they even drive on the opposite side of the road. Successfully bringing together these different environments into a coherent whole is a daunting task and one that will likely take decades to accomplish.\nOn the infrastructure front the key objective is to achieve a ‘one-hour living circle’. Some of the main projects have already been completed. A good example is the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. The 55-kilometre bridge-tunnel system is both the longest sea crossing and the longest open-sea fixed link in the world (as a reference, the English Channel is 33.3 km at its narrowest point) and is symbolic of the kind of infrastructure that will soon interconnect the area. The high-speed rail connecting Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou is another iconic example.\nFinancial services also stand out as a major area of development. In late 2021 the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) signed a Memorandum to provide a one-stop platform\nto allow financial institutions and tech firms to launch pilot tests either side of the border (https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/where-is-china-heading-to-2021/)\n. Similarly, another major landmark was the launch of the ‘Wealth Management Connect’, allowing residents across the GBA to invest in wealth management products in each other’s markets.\nAnother pillar of the strategy is to promote entrepreneurship and STEM education (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), especially among the young. To achieve this the Youth Development Commission has rolled out two funding schemes under the Youth Development Fund: the Entrepreneurship Scheme (which will subsidise entrepreneurship projects); and the Experiential Scheme (which will subsidise short-term experiential projects with special emphasis on IT). The region has world class Technology Parks in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Hong Kong, which provide incubation, acceleration and funding programmes to further propel start-ups to become scalable businesses.\nSome of the most notable future developments involve innovation-related projects such as the ‘Lok Ma Chau Innovation and Technology Park’, which will be managed simultaneously by the Hong Kong and Shenzhen authorities. On the same border between the two cities, the Hong Kong Government recently announced its intention to build a ‘Northern Metropolis’. The plan, which would take 20 years to complete, is seen as a major strategic change for development, moving the city’s centre of gravity away from its traditional centre on Hong Kong Island up north, to integrate it into the latest national development plan. There are also plans to allow Hong Kong citizens to work and live visa-free in the GBA while continuing to pay taxes in the SAR.\nAlthough\nthe emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic (https://especiales.realinstitutoelcano.org/coronavirus/?lang=en)\nhas put a halt to some of the initiatives, the level of governmental and business support for the project indicates that it will continue to move forward despite the delays. In this respect, China is likely to succeed in making the GBA a more coherent whole and in leveraging the process to spur growth and innovation.

What is clear is that, in any case, the initiative will have a notable impact on the global economic scenario and will play a key role in China’s overall strategy for the 21\nst\ncentury.\nImage: Hong Kong-Guangdong border on Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, an infrastructure part of the Great Bay Area project.

Also feel free to ask any questions about life in Australia.\n146K\nMembers\nOnline\n•\n1 yr. ago\nKetchuproll95 (https://www.reddit.com/user/Ketchuproll95/)\nUsing Singapore's housing model as an example of what to do is misunderstood.\nGov Publications (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/?f=flair_name%3A%22Gov%20Publications%22)\nI've heard many people in the recent housing debate use Singapore as an example of what Australia should follow. I myself am from Singapore, and have spent the last 6 years here in Australia. It won't work.\nThere are a few reasons why.\nThere is a reason I think high-density housing is not popular in Australia; many people still do want to have a proper house, a landed property. Maybe it's the pastoral history, or just a matter of expectations, but I don't see a massive amount of the population moving into housing as dense as it is in Singapore. There is also the fact that these types of property developments are disproportionately expensive compared to landed property, they just don't seem that good of a deal. Then there's also the fear (not entirely unfounded) of being screwed over by a predatory developer, or some other undesirable circumstances, which links back to the desire and safety of owning a proper plot of land.\nSecondly, the Singapore housing model is built on the backs of cheap labour from overseas. I mean CHEAP, EXPLOITATIVE even. It has been compared to slavery. They work 6 days a week, from dawn to dusk, are paid something like 600 bucks a MONTH (The Australian and Singapore dollars hover around 1:1 exchange ), live in terrible conditions, and they work HARD. These workers make up almost 1/10th of the population, they make up the ENTIRETY of the construction industry. The career of the tradesperson simply does not exist in Singapore the way it does here. Is Australia prepared for that? Not to mention the implications on the already heated immigration situation.\nAnd my final point: Australia shouldn't HAVE to do any of that. The very premises and contexts which Singapore was built on are fundamentally different. It is a tiny TINY island with a population upwards of 6 million and no natural resources whatsoever. This has resulted in us adopting many politically extreme measures, dramatic policies, and a heavy-handed government. We are prepared to accept these things as a matter of survival, of cold pragmatism. Australia on the other hand, is about 25 million people, and you've got a whole continent; even if you only include the more inhabitable coastal areas. There is an abundence of natural resources. It is also a geopolitical fortress, with no real threats or serious competitors nearby. Why has it even reached a point where you're looking at one of the most densely populated places on earth for comparison?\nI think the Australian government is complacent. There, I said it. They don't think ahead, and rely on the vast wealth and priveleged circumstances of Australia to carry them through. They get away with mistakes and suboptimal policy because the repercussions have never been truly critical. It's never been a matter of survival like it is with Singapore. But these things compound and compound, and now you find yourselves in this moment of crisis.\nArchived post.

You neglect to criticise the disadvantages of sprawl.\n25 years ago my mum moved to Albion Park Rail, a tiny suburb at the southern tip of Lake Illawarra. Quarter acre blocks, two blocks deep, running along the lakeshore. Behind them was rolling green pasture land.\nTen years later, all of the pasture had been covered over with immense McMansions. Productive agricultural land out, games rooms and triple garages for the jet skis in. Sheer folly to misuse land like that.\nPerth sprawls 150 km up and down the coast. Sprawl is busily eating what remains of farmland west of the scarp; suburban market gardens are banished further afield.\nObviously we don't want a hyper dense urban jungle but the equally ridiculous other extreme is single family dwellings sprawling halfway to Kalgoorlie. We really do need a compromise in terms of density and overall city size.\nI think the Australian government is complacent. There, I said it. They don't think ahead, and rely on the vast wealth and priveleged circumstances of Australia to carry them through. They get away with mistakes and suboptimal policy because the repercussions have never been truly critical. It's never been a matter of survival like it is with Singapore. But these things compound and compound, and now you find yourselves in this moment of crisis.\nAbsolutely right, I agree, and so do many Aussies.\nAustralia is a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its luck. It lives on other people's ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by surprise.\n~Donald Horne,\nThe Lucky Country (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lucky_Country)\n1964\ntrack me\n[No Text] (https://www.reddit.com/user/EcstaticOrchid4825/)\nEcstaticOrchid4825 (https://www.reddit.com/user/EcstaticOrchid4825/)\n•\n1y ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l09m4ql/)\nThe point about labour exploitation is a great one.

Singapore has totally been built off the back of exploitation. In construction/maintenance and domestic helpers.\nYou even missed one other big negative, being that HDB ownership is still very biased towards straight, married couples and much more difficult for singles. That would not fly here by a long shot.\nBut the positives are something that can be aspired to.

There's an option in between stand-alone housing and high density apartments. Like in any European city. Charming, generous apartments in 3-6 story buildings with a communal garden or courtyard and retail on the ground floor. It's a centuries old urban development model, it works very well and creates pleasant civic environments and thriving small businesses catering to the local community. Add some decent public transport, which is now viable because of the density, and off you go. Beautiful, accessible and affordable urban environment with high economic activity and low crime.

The savings/profits go into making the units affordable.\nStandards, and the willingness to enforce them. Australia only has one half of that sentence.\nProtecting ordinary citizens. You can only have ONE HDB unit. Foreigners cannot buy land or landed properties (except in sentosa). Foreigners cannot buy HDB units. Foreigners cannot rent HDB units. Short term rentals cannot be in HDB units. This is really basic stuff that Australia shrugs at for some reason, allowing rich locals/foreigners to outbid and screw over ordinary people.\nNotice all of the above doesn't interfere in the free markett, flow of capital, profit incentives, etc. if property developers want to make luxury condos to sell to foreigners or rich locals they can, nothing is stopping them. There's a rich and diverse selection of condos to choose from. But what makes Singapore work is the HDBs and it's really not that hard to emulate via the 3 points above. It is not necessary to talk about labour costs and other points.\n19\nmore replies\n19\nmore replies\nMore replies (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l08zzp0/)\n[No Text] (https://www.reddit.com/user/AfraidScheme433/)\nAfraidScheme433 (https://www.reddit.com/user/AfraidScheme433/)\n•\n1y ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l0a8844/)\npoliticians are friends with rich landlords…\n4\nmore replies\n4\nmore replies\nMore replies (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l0a8844/)\nNew to Reddit?\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n繼續透過 Google 帳戶操作\n繼續透過 Google 帳戶操作。在新分頁中開啟\nContinue with Email\nContinue With Phone Number\nBy continuing, you agree to our\nUser Agreement (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement)\nand acknowledge that you understand the\nPrivacy Policy (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy)\n.\nMore posts you may like\nSystemic contradictions in Singapore’s approach to public housing (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bue09i/systemic_contradictions_in_singapores_approach_to/)\nr/singapore (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore)\n•\n1 yr. ago\nr/singapore (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/)\nWelcome to /r/singapore: The place for anything Singapore.\n1.8M\nMembers\nOnline\nSystemic contradictions in Singapore’s approach to public housing (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bue09i/systemic_contradictions_in_singapores_approach_to/)\n[No Text] (https://www.academia.sg/academic-views/chua-beng-huat-public-housing/?fbclid=IwAR29rbI2-g4rWNqa8Py8AENUGuaZUY0EiG2l9IfuXi9DNL03yc_OnrQMFwM_aem_AbmF-RsA9V0XXrBG-qUKJzX8yYzO1WhJjbGBFThcFw11ehRN_gf6JWu_uz5M09Cmziw)\nacademia\n416\nupvotes\n·\n143\ncomments\nWould the Singapore Government Housing Solution Work Here?

Also feel free to ask any questions about life in Australia.\n146K\nMembers\nOnline\n•\n1 yr. ago\nKetchuproll95 (https://www.reddit.com/user/Ketchuproll95/)\nUsing Singapore's housing model as an example of what to do is misunderstood.\nGov Publications (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/?f=flair_name%3A%22Gov%20Publications%22)\nI've heard many people in the recent housing debate use Singapore as an example of what Australia should follow. I myself am from Singapore, and have spent the last 6 years here in Australia. It won't work.\nThere are a few reasons why.\nThere is a reason I think high-density housing is not popular in Australia; many people still do want to have a proper house, a landed property. Maybe it's the pastoral history, or just a matter of expectations, but I don't see a massive amount of the population moving into housing as dense as it is in Singapore. There is also the fact that these types of property developments are disproportionately expensive compared to landed property, they just don't seem that good of a deal. Then there's also the fear (not entirely unfounded) of being screwed over by a predatory developer, or some other undesirable circumstances, which links back to the desire and safety of owning a proper plot of land.\nSecondly, the Singapore housing model is built on the backs of cheap labour from overseas. I mean CHEAP, EXPLOITATIVE even. It has been compared to slavery. They work 6 days a week, from dawn to dusk, are paid something like 600 bucks a MONTH (The Australian and Singapore dollars hover around 1:1 exchange ), live in terrible conditions, and they work HARD. These workers make up almost 1/10th of the population, they make up the ENTIRETY of the construction industry. The career of the tradesperson simply does not exist in Singapore the way it does here. Is Australia prepared for that? Not to mention the implications on the already heated immigration situation.\nAnd my final point: Australia shouldn't HAVE to do any of that. The very premises and contexts which Singapore was built on are fundamentally different. It is a tiny TINY island with a population upwards of 6 million and no natural resources whatsoever. This has resulted in us adopting many politically extreme measures, dramatic policies, and a heavy-handed government. We are prepared to accept these things as a matter of survival, of cold pragmatism. Australia on the other hand, is about 25 million people, and you've got a whole continent; even if you only include the more inhabitable coastal areas. There is an abundence of natural resources. It is also a geopolitical fortress, with no real threats or serious competitors nearby. Why has it even reached a point where you're looking at one of the most densely populated places on earth for comparison?\nI think the Australian government is complacent. There, I said it. They don't think ahead, and rely on the vast wealth and priveleged circumstances of Australia to carry them through. They get away with mistakes and suboptimal policy because the repercussions have never been truly critical. It's never been a matter of survival like it is with Singapore. But these things compound and compound, and now you find yourselves in this moment of crisis.\nRead more\nArchived post.

You neglect to criticise the disadvantages of sprawl.\n25 years ago my mum moved to Albion Park Rail, a tiny suburb at the southern tip of Lake Illawarra. Quarter acre blocks, two blocks deep, running along the lakeshore. Behind them was rolling green pasture land.\nTen years later, all of the pasture had been covered over with immense McMansions. Productive agricultural land out, games rooms and triple garages for the jet skis in. Sheer folly to misuse land like that.\nPerth sprawls 150 km up and down the coast. Sprawl is busily eating what remains of farmland west of the scarp; suburban market gardens are banished further afield.\nObviously we don't want a hyper dense urban jungle but the equally ridiculous other extreme is single family dwellings sprawling halfway to Kalgoorlie. We really do need a compromise in terms of density and overall city size.\nI think the Australian government is complacent. There, I said it. They don't think ahead, and rely on the vast wealth and priveleged circumstances of Australia to carry them through. They get away with mistakes and suboptimal policy because the repercussions have never been truly critical. It's never been a matter of survival like it is with Singapore. But these things compound and compound, and now you find yourselves in this moment of crisis.\nAbsolutely right, I agree, and so do many Aussies.\nAustralia is a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its luck. It lives on other people's ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by surprise.\n~Donald Horne,\nThe Lucky Country (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lucky_Country)\n1964\ntrack me\nReply\nreply\nShare\n[No Text] (https://www.reddit.com/user/EcstaticOrchid4825/)\nEcstaticOrchid4825 (https://www.reddit.com/user/EcstaticOrchid4825/)\n•\n1y ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l09m4ql/)\nThe point about labour exploitation is a great one.

Singapore has totally been built off the back of exploitation. In construction/maintenance and domestic helpers.\nYou even missed one other big negative, being that HDB ownership is still very biased towards straight, married couples and much more difficult for singles. That would not fly here by a long shot.\nBut the positives are something that can be aspired to.  Housing that is built with people's wellbeing in mind, and the ability for all citizens to have their own home (albeit within a specific rule set).\nIt's more about how could we adapt for this country?\nReply\nreply\nShare\n2\nmore replies\n2\nmore replies\nMore replies (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l08z8sl/)\n[No Text] (https://www.reddit.com/user/Tolstoy_mc/)\nTolstoy_mc (https://www.reddit.com/user/Tolstoy_mc/)\n•\n1y ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l0a09bs/)\nIt's the missing middle again. There's an option in between stand-alone housing and high density apartments. Like in any European city. Charming, generous apartments in 3-6 story buildings with a communal garden or courtyard and retail on the ground floor. It's a centuries old urban development model, it works very well and creates pleasant civic environments and thriving small businesses catering to the local community. Add some decent public transport, which is now viable because of the density, and off you go. Beautiful, accessible and affordable urban environment with high economic activity and low crime. It'll probably never catch on tho.\nReply\nreply\nShare\n1\nmore reply\n1\nmore reply\nMore replies (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l0a09bs/)\n[No Text] (https://www.reddit.com/user/eoffif44/)\neoffif44 (https://www.reddit.com/user/eoffif44/)\n•\n1y ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l08zzp0/)\nI think you're missing the point of the Singapore model.\nThere are 3 main things that make it affordable for the average Singaporean to own a home in the densest, wealthiest, most competitive island on earth:\nThe government is a developer - they alone benefit from having sweetheart deals and advanced knowledge of zoning changes, not the mates of politicians. The savings/profits go into making the units affordable.\nStandards, and the willingness to enforce them. Australia only has one half of that sentence.\nProtecting ordinary citizens. You can only have ONE HDB unit. Foreigners cannot buy land or landed properties (except in sentosa). Foreigners cannot buy HDB units. Foreigners cannot rent HDB units. Short term rentals cannot be in HDB units. This is really basic stuff that Australia shrugs at for some reason, allowing rich locals/foreigners to outbid and screw over ordinary people.\nNotice all of the above doesn't interfere in the free markett, flow of capital, profit incentives, etc. if property developers want to make luxury condos to sell to foreigners or rich locals they can, nothing is stopping them. There's a rich and diverse selection of condos to choose from. But what makes Singapore work is the HDBs and it's really not that hard to emulate via the 3 points above. It is not necessary to talk about labour costs and other points.\nReply\nreply\nShare\n19\nmore replies\n19\nmore replies\nMore replies (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l08zzp0/)\n[No Text] (https://www.reddit.com/user/AfraidScheme433/)\nAfraidScheme433 (https://www.reddit.com/user/AfraidScheme433/)\n•\n1y ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l0a8844/)\npoliticians are friends with rich landlords…\nReply\nreply\nShare\n4\nmore replies\n4\nmore replies\nMore replies (https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1c7mdj9/comment/l0a8844/)\nNew to Reddit?\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\nContinue with Email\nContinue With Phone Number\nBy continuing, you agree to our\nUser Agreement (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement)\nand acknowledge that you understand the\nPrivacy Policy (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy)\n.\nMore posts you may like\nSystemic contradictions in Singapore’s approach to public housing (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bue09i/systemic_contradictions_in_singapores_approach_to/)\nr/singapore (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore)\n•\n1 yr. ago\nr/singapore (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/)\nWelcome to /r/singapore: The place for anything Singapore.\n1.8M\nMembers\nOnline\nSystemic contradictions in Singapore’s approach to public housing (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bue09i/systemic_contradictions_in_singapores_approach_to/)\n[No Text] (https://www.academia.sg/academic-views/chua-beng-huat-public-housing/?fbclid=IwAR29rbI2-g4rWNqa8Py8AENUGuaZUY0EiG2l9IfuXi9DNL03yc_OnrQMFwM_aem_AbmF-RsA9V0XXrBG-qUKJzX8yYzO1WhJjbGBFThcFw11ehRN_gf6JWu_uz5M09Cmziw)\nacademia\n416\nupvotes\n·\n143\ncomments\nWould the Singapore Government Housing Solution Work Here?

It showed ‘plan and market’ in a creative partnership in which government control, export-oriented manufacturing, government direction of the labor market, state-owned enterprises and government-forced saving co-exist and help the economy excel and prosper. A supply-side analysis showed that foreign talent through employment passes and work permits were an integral building block for the economic success and contributed 41% of GDP in the 1990s (Ministry of Trade and Industry 2001).\nDiscover the world's research\n25+ million members\n160+ million publication pages\n2.3+ billion citations\nJoin for free (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/signup.SignUp.html)\nI already have an account (https://www.researchgate.net/login?_sg=AMbDEi4x3OfcE280QT7qwcWJ8mcDMvB3H7YTuBeYYBX0_ylVUPCkGmxVhY2mEure5SPLGTPHaEdNyw)\nPublic full-texts\nTo read the full-text of this research, you can request a copy directly from the authors.\nRequest full-text PDF (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publicliterature.PublicPublicationPromoRequestFulltext.signup.html?publicationUid=349541341&ev=su_requestFulltext)\nSimilar research\n[No Text] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/figure/The-biggest-Singaporean-companies-in-Temaseks-portfolio-as-of-March-2015_tbl1_369161364)\nChapter 10: A Successful Model of State Capitalism: Singapore (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369161364_Chapter_10_A_Successful_Model_of_State_Capitalism_Singapore?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nChapter (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/369161364_Chapter_10_A_Successful_Model_of_State_Capitalism_Singapore)\nFull-text available (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/369161364_Chapter_10_A_Successful_Model_of_State_Capitalism_Singapore)\nFebruary 2020\n·\n283 Reads\n·\n7 Citations\nKatalin Völgyi (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/scientific-contributions/Katalin-Voelgyi-2246181339)\nView (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369161364_Chapter_10_A_Successful_Model_of_State_Capitalism_Singapore?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nState-owned enterprises, state capitalism and social distribution in Singapore (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277621919_State-owned_enterprises_state_capitalism_and_social_distribution_in_Singapore?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nArticle (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/277621919_State-owned_enterprises_state_capitalism_and_social_distribution_in_Singapore)\nApril 2015\n·\n345 Reads\n·\n73 Citations\nThe Pacific Review\nChua Beng Huat (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/scientific-contributions/Chua-Beng-Huat-2039860336)\nState-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds have ‘insured’ Singapore's domestic economy against financial crisis and restructuring interventions from multilateral institutions, engendered elite cohesion and political stability, binding middle class employees to the political system. This essay analyses paths by which the Singapore government established state-owned enterprises and transformed them into global enterprises. It also examines how sovereign wealth funds contribute to government social expenditure without increasing taxes. Such redistribution through state capitalism resonates with the People's Action Partys social democratic origins, inviting comparisons with contemporary developments in Chinese state-capitalism.\nRead more\nView (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277621919_State-owned_enterprises_state_capitalism_and_social_distribution_in_Singapore?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nUnderstanding the Singaporean approach to state ownership: 'commercially viable strategic alignment' in historical perspective (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358240392_Understanding_the_Singaporean_approach_to_state_ownership_'commercially_viable_strategic_alignment'_in_historical_perspective?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nArticle (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/358240392_Understanding_the_Singaporean_approach_to_state_ownership_'commercially_viable_strategic_alignment'_in_historical_perspective)\nJanuary 2022\n·\n41 Reads\n·\n6 Citations\nStructural Change and Economic Dynamics\nJoão Silva (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/profile/Joao-Silva-236)\nThis article provides an Institutional Political Economy analysis of Singapore's approach to state ownership. It argues that, since this country's independence in the 1960s, its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have both been run in a manner conducive to commercial viability and highly aligned with governmental economic priorities. This ‘commercially viable strategic alignment’, largely absent in SOEs worldwide, has favored cautious privatization and thus the maintenance of a strong SOE sector in Singapore. While recent political backlash from investing abroad has led the government to apparently distance itself from SOEs and Temasek – the SOE-holding-company-turned-investment-fund – their role in developing venture capital and entrepreneurship – both governmental priorities – suggests that a ‘strategic alignment’ remains. Drawing from their substantial financial resources, these entities complement other government efforts in terms of funding, being important players in the Singaporean venture capital markets and having even directly and indirectly invested in Singapore's most successful high-growth companies. In addition, due to their presence in global networks and the complimentary assets they possess, such as access to customers, intellectual property, they provide investees with resources that facilitate their growth and increase their likelihood of succeeding.\nRead more\nView (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358240392_Understanding_the_Singaporean_approach_to_state_ownership_'commercially_viable_strategic_alignment'_in_historical_perspective?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nNavigating Governance: A Comparative Analysis of Statutory Bodies in Singapore and Australia (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374497399_Navigating_Governance_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Statutory_Bodies_in_Singapore_and_Australia?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nArticle (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/374497399_Navigating_Governance_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Statutory_Bodies_in_Singapore_and_Australia)\nSeptember 2023\n·\n23 Reads\nInternational Journal of Academic Research in Public Policy and Governance\nLinlin Song (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/scientific-contributions/Linlin-Song-2262835164)\n·\nIke M.

Based on a variety of sources and data, I argue that these two SWFs, Temasek Holdings and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, are state-sanctioned means to secure the economic future of Singapore; they are not strategic devices developed by the Singapore government to pose geopolitical or economic threats on other states. Over time, their economic functions and strategic orientations have evolved with the city-state's dynamic developmental trajectories in the global economy. In the post-Cold War era of global finance, these state-controlled and professionally managed financial investment vehicles are more visible and active in their global expansion and acquisition trails.

It showed ‘plan and market’ in a creative partnership in which government control, export-oriented manufacturing, government direction of the labor market, state-owned enterprises and government-forced saving co-exist and help the economy excel and prosper. A supply-side analysis showed that foreign talent through employment passes and work permits were an integral building block for the economic success and contributed 41% of GDP in the 1990s (Ministry of Trade and Industry 2001).\nDiscover the world's research\n25+ million members\n160+ million publication pages\n2.3+ billion citations\nJoin for free (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/signup.SignUp.html)\nI already have an account (https://www.researchgate.net/login?_sg=r0rO3t0_-67oueuIlE9g37RVlg_T3BbFipDficnPNCqNITn2xb-avSy1Nrus29gamrMcBZtzhFgIUw)\nPublic full-texts\nTo read the full-text of this research, you can request a copy directly from the authors.\nRequest full-text PDF (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publicliterature.PublicPublicationPromoRequestFulltext.signup.html?publicationUid=349541341&ev=su_requestFulltext)\nSimilar research\n[No Text] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/figure/The-biggest-Singaporean-companies-in-Temaseks-portfolio-as-of-March-2015_tbl1_369161364)\nChapter 10: A Successful Model of State Capitalism: Singapore (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369161364_Chapter_10_A_Successful_Model_of_State_Capitalism_Singapore?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nChapter (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/369161364_Chapter_10_A_Successful_Model_of_State_Capitalism_Singapore)\nFull-text available (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/369161364_Chapter_10_A_Successful_Model_of_State_Capitalism_Singapore)\nFebruary 2020\n·\n283 Reads\n·\n7 Citations\nKatalin Völgyi (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/scientific-contributions/Katalin-Voelgyi-2246181339)\nView (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369161364_Chapter_10_A_Successful_Model_of_State_Capitalism_Singapore?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nState-owned enterprises, state capitalism and social distribution in Singapore (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277621919_State-owned_enterprises_state_capitalism_and_social_distribution_in_Singapore?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nArticle (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/277621919_State-owned_enterprises_state_capitalism_and_social_distribution_in_Singapore)\nApril 2015\n·\n345 Reads\n·\n73 Citations\nThe Pacific Review\nChua Beng Huat (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/scientific-contributions/Chua-Beng-Huat-2039860336)\nState-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds have ‘insured’ Singapore's domestic economy against financial crisis and restructuring interventions from multilateral institutions, engendered elite cohesion and political stability, binding middle class employees to the political system. This essay analyses paths by which the Singapore government established state-owned enterprises and transformed them into global enterprises. It also examines how sovereign wealth funds contribute to government social expenditure without increasing taxes. Such redistribution through state capitalism resonates with the People's Action Partys social democratic origins, inviting comparisons with contemporary developments in Chinese state-capitalism.\nRead more\nView (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277621919_State-owned_enterprises_state_capitalism_and_social_distribution_in_Singapore?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nUnderstanding the Singaporean approach to state ownership: 'commercially viable strategic alignment' in historical perspective (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358240392_Understanding_the_Singaporean_approach_to_state_ownership_'commercially_viable_strategic_alignment'_in_historical_perspective?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nArticle (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/358240392_Understanding_the_Singaporean_approach_to_state_ownership_'commercially_viable_strategic_alignment'_in_historical_perspective)\nJanuary 2022\n·\n41 Reads\n·\n6 Citations\nStructural Change and Economic Dynamics\nJoão Silva (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/profile/Joao-Silva-236)\nThis article provides an Institutional Political Economy analysis of Singapore's approach to state ownership. It argues that, since this country's independence in the 1960s, its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have both been run in a manner conducive to commercial viability and highly aligned with governmental economic priorities. This ‘commercially viable strategic alignment’, largely absent in SOEs worldwide, has favored cautious privatization and thus the maintenance of a strong SOE sector in Singapore. While recent political backlash from investing abroad has led the government to apparently distance itself from SOEs and Temasek – the SOE-holding-company-turned-investment-fund – their role in developing venture capital and entrepreneurship – both governmental priorities – suggests that a ‘strategic alignment’ remains. Drawing from their substantial financial resources, these entities complement other government efforts in terms of funding, being important players in the Singaporean venture capital markets and having even directly and indirectly invested in Singapore's most successful high-growth companies. In addition, due to their presence in global networks and the complimentary assets they possess, such as access to customers, intellectual property, they provide investees with resources that facilitate their growth and increase their likelihood of succeeding.\nRead more\nView (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358240392_Understanding_the_Singaporean_approach_to_state_ownership_'commercially_viable_strategic_alignment'_in_historical_perspective?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nNavigating Governance: A Comparative Analysis of Statutory Bodies in Singapore and Australia (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374497399_Navigating_Governance_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Statutory_Bodies_in_Singapore_and_Australia?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nArticle (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/374497399_Navigating_Governance_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Statutory_Bodies_in_Singapore_and_Australia)\nSeptember 2023\n·\n23 Reads\nInternational Journal of Academic Research in Public Policy and Governance\nLinlin Song (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/scientific-contributions/Linlin-Song-2262835164)\n·\nIke M.

Based on a variety of sources and data, I argue that these two SWFs, Temasek Holdings and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, are state-sanctioned means to secure the economic future of Singapore; they are not strategic devices developed by the Singapore government to pose geopolitical or economic threats on other states. Over time, their economic functions and strategic orientations have evolved with the city-state's dynamic developmental trajectories in the global economy. In the post-Cold War era of global finance, these state-controlled and professionally managed financial investment vehicles are more visible and active in their global expansion and acquisition trails. There are thus significant challenges to their strategic governance and international legitimacy in this new world order. This paper considers some of these challenges in light of recent development in the two SWFs and assesses their organizational and institutional responses to such challenges in today's competitive global economy. This case study of Singapore's SWFs illustrates the critical importance for understanding the rise of SWFs from small states in the evolving global system.\nRead more\nView (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233231940_From_national_development_to_economic_diplomacy_Governing_Singapore's_sovereign_wealth_funds?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19)\nAd\nCompany\nAbout us (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/about)\nBlog (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/blog)\nCareers (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/careers)\nResources\nHelp Center (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fexplore.researchgate.net?forcePage=false)\nContact us (https://help.researchgate.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=13146494812305)\nBusiness Solutions\nMarketing Solutions (https://www.researchgate.net/marketing-solutions)\nScientific Recruitment (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/scientific-recruitment)\nPublisher Solutions (https://www.researchgate.net/publisher-solutions)\n[No Text] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/go.GetApp.html?interested=true&originCh=footerLoggedOut)\n[No Text] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.researchgate.shellapp)\n[No Text] (https://www.linkedin.com/company/researchgate/)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/ResearchGate)\n[No Text] (https://www.facebook.com/ResearchGate/)\n[No Text] (https://www.instagram.com/researchgate_official/)\n© 2008-\n2025\nResearchGate GmbH.

exit from Malaysia thrust Singapore into the open. Without a hinterland nor natural resources, the challenges facing the new nation were immense. Labour unrest continued to fester while unemployment remained high. The only solution was to press on with the plan to rapidly industrialise the economy.\nWithout Malaysia’s large market, Singapore’s leaders had to think out of the box. Instead of focusing on the domestic market, our leaders switched to an export-oriented strategy. Labour-intensive industries were created to soak up unemployment while we pushed ahead with building infrastructure that would serve industries.\nHowever, Singapore’s plans were disrupted by a shock announcement. In 1967, the British announced that it would withdraw its forces from Singapore, which would compromise Singapore’s defence and impact our economy.\n[No Text] (https://www.sg101.gov.sg/economy/digging-deeper-case-studies/withdrawal)\nThe British withdrawal meant that Singapore had to accelerate its plans for an export-led industralisation strategy. So while some newly independent nations with large domestic markets were adopting protectionist policies – ejecting foreign companies, slashing imports and manufacturing their own products for the domestic market – Singapore had to go against the grain and open our borders to foreign investors.\nGaining a Foothold in the Global Market\nTo survive, Singapore had to tap on the global market. As then-Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee explained:\nThe economic rationale behind the courting of foreign investors was twofold:\nFirst, large foreign companies targeted the global market. They had the necessary expertise and networks that would allow Singapore to quickly scale up these industries. They also had the financial capital to invest in Singapore’s infrastructure. For instance, oil company Shell built Singapore’s first oil refinery at the cost of S$30 million on Pulau Bukom in 1961.\nSecond, our goal was to eventually enable knowledge transfer from foreign companies to local enterprises. This would enable local companies to acquire the necessary technical expertise to start building local industries in the longer term.\nSingapore thus pressed ahead with the export-oriented strategy.\nEDB shifted its focus to promoting Singapore as an attractive destination for foreign investment. Its other functions were then transferred to new agencies set up in 1968. For one, initial function of providing financing to companies was hived off to the newly set-up Development Bank of Singapore (DBS). Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) took over the development and management of industrial infrastructure, while EDB’s export promotion division was absorbed by Intraco, a government trading company.\nWith that, EDB officers fanned out to foreign markets that included the United States and Japan to persuade big companies such as Texas Instruments, Fairchild and Seiko to set up their production bases in Singapore. EDB prioritised attracting these investments and went the extra mile to ensure that the foreign companies had what they needed.\nIn 1968, when National Semiconductor visited Singapore, EDB’s officers found out that there was an urgent need for the company to start production within two months.\nEDB worked with other government agencies to quicken this process. Within two weeks of the visit, National Semiconductor was in business here. The speed and efficiency of this operation drew the attention of other American manufacturers. Fairchild came soon after, followed by Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard and General Electric.\nTo further boost Singapore’s attraction to foreign investors, the government also created a conducive investment environment.\nIn 1967, the Economic Expansion Incentives Act was introduced. It provided new tax incentives for investments. These included tax emeptions and reliefs, such as up to 90% remission of tax profits to approved enterprises for up to 15 years.\nThe government also continued to build infrastructure to support Singapore’s industrialisation efforts.\nIn 1964, the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) was created to take over the functions of Singapore Harbour Board, which was previously in charge of port operations. In 1971, PSA also took over and converted the former British Naval Base Store Basin into Sembawang Wharves .\nIn 1965, as part of the Jurong industrialisation project, we opened Jurong Port, which handled bulk cargo used by industries located in Jurong.\nIn 1968, Neptune Orient Lines was established, and this gave Singapore another way to support the economy through fair freight routes.\nCommunication services such as postal, telegraph, telephone, and telex services also developed quickly between 1966 and 1973.\nFocusing on Education and Training\nAs Singapore began vocational training in the early 1960s, by 1965 we had a pool of semi-skilled workers who could support the nation’s growing industrialisation. We continued putting emphasis on training and developing human capital to stay relevant.\nAs then-Finance Minister Goh explained:\nQuelling Labour Unrest and Communism\nAnother key priority for the government was to stamp out the communist elements that were fomenting unrest and dissent. Dr Winsemius described this as a top objective for the government:\nThe National Trades Union Congress was founded in 1961, after the communist elements broke away from the PAP. Over the course of three years, NTUC battled with the Singapore Association of Trade Unions for influence over workers. In 1968, the government amended the Industrial Relations Act, which was aimed at reducing the number of strikes in the economy.\n(Image:\nNTUC (http://ms50.ntuc.org.sg/1960s/)\n)\nIn 1969, NTUC held the “Modernisation of the Labour Movement” seminar, a forum that looked to build on the new norm in industrial relations. At this seminar, then-PM Lee urged the unions to shed its image as purely as “a combat organisation… for class war,” and move towards acting in the interests of the nation. This formed the foundation of what would later be known as tripartism.\nTripartism refers to the collaboration among unions, employers and the government. The goal is for the three parties to work together in a consultative and collaborative fashion to further shared interests.\nThe National Wages Council, set up in 1972, is one key manifestation of tripartism. It aims to bring employers, unions and the government to a consensus on wages, an issue that was traditionally damaging to labour relations. Since then, the NWC issues yearly wage guidelines that take into account the interests of all three parties, ensuring compromise instead of confrontation.\n(Image: The introduction of tripartism in Singapore resulted in a marked decrease in the number of work stoppages and man-days lost by 1968; Singapore Year Book 1968; National Archives of Singapore)\nAfter the introduction of tripartism, the number of labour strikes decreased from 10 in 1972 to one in 1977. There were none from 1997 to 2012. In this same period, unemployment fell in Singapore and foreign direct investment rose.\nToday, tripartism is seen as a key competitive advantage for Singapore. It has been called Singapore’s “secret weapon” for helping to boost the country’s economic competitiveness, promoting harmonious labour-management relations, and contributing to Singapore’s overall progress.\nBy 1970, about a decade after the industrialisation plan was first conceived, Singapore had achieved near full employment. Industrial action had dropped significantly. And a spirit of cooperation superseded the disruptions of the preceding years.\n[No Text] (http://ms50.ntuc.org.sg/1960s/)\n[No Text]

The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced today that \n\nSingapore’s GDP growth forecast for 2025 has been upgraded from “0.0 to 2.0 per cent” to “1.5 to 2.5 per cent”. This largely reflects the better-than-expected performance of the Singapore economy in the first half of 2025. However, the economic outlook for the rest of the year remains clouded by uncertainty, with the risks tilted to the downside. \n\nEconomic Performance in Second Quarter 2025 \n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, the Singapore economy grew by 4.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis, extending the 4.1 per cent growth in the previous quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the Singapore economy expanded by 1.4 per cent, a reversal from the 0.5 per cent contraction in the first quarter . For the first half of 2025, Singapore’s GDP growth came in at 4.3 per cent year-on-year. \n\nOn a year-on-year basis, GDP growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by the wholesale trade, manufacturing, finance & insurance, and transportation & storage sectors. In turn, the wholesale trade and transportation & storage sectors were boosted by front-loading activities in the region ahead of the implementation of tariff measures by the US. On the other hand, the food & beverage services sector shrank, due in part to a sustained increase in outbound travel by locals. \n\n[Refer to Annex A for the economic performance of the various sectors.]         \n\n> 3.4\n> 5.7\n> 5.0\n> 4.1 4.4\n> 1.8\n> 4.4\n> 1.5 - 2.5\n> 0.0\n> 1.0\n> 2.0\n> 3.0\n> 4.0\n> 5.0\n> 6.0\n> 7.0\n> 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24 1Q25 2Q25 2023 2024 2025f\n> YoY % change\n\nSingapore's Real GDP Growth \n\n> Full-Year Growth (%)\n\n2\n\nEconomic Outlook for 2025 \n\nMTI maintained the GDP growth forecast at “0.0 to 2.0 per cent” in May, in view of the potential impact of the sweeping tariffs announced in April on major economies. \n\nSince then, the performance of most advanced and regional economies has been more resilient than expected as the US’ 90-day pause on its reciprocal tariffs 1 postponed the potential negative economic impact, while front-loading activities during the tariff pause provided a temporary boost to production and exports. There has also been a de-escalation in trade tensions, with the US striking trade deals with several trading partners, including  the Eurozone, Japan, South Korea and several Southeast Asian economies, that led to a lowering of their reciprocal tariffs compared to that announced earlier. 2 Meanwhile, the US and China continue to be engaged in trade talks, with indications that the 90-day tariff truce between the two countries could be extended. 3\n\nConsequently, the 2025 GDP growth of the key economies,  including the US, Eurozone and China,  is not expected to be as weak as earlier projected. Accordingly, MTI has updated its assessment of the overall external outlook for Singapore. \n\nLooking ahead, the growth of Singapore’s major trading partners in the second half of the year is expected to moderate from that in the first half, as the boost from front-loading activities dissipates and the US’ reciprocal tariffs take effect. In the US, GDP \n\ngrowth is projected to weaken for the rest of the year amidst signs of a cooling labour market and as upward price pressures from tariff hikes dampen consumer spending. Meanwhile, the Eurozone could see  a pullback in exports and hence GDP growth  as the \n\nUS’ reciprocal and sectoral tariffs come into effect in the latter half of 2025 . Even so, \n\neasing trade tensions with the US could lift economic sentiments, and alongside lower inflation and accommodative monetary policy, provide some support to domestic demand. \n\nIn Asia, China’s GDP growth is also projected to ease over the course of the year on \n\naccount of weaker exports growth as global trade activity turns more subdued with the implementation of the US’ tariff measures. On the other hand, domestic consumption and investment growth are expected to remain firm, supported by policy measures. The GDP growth of key Southeast Asian economies is similarly expected to moderate in the    \n\n> 1On 9 April 2025, the US implemented a 90-day pause on its reciprocal tariffs until 9 July 2025. The pause was later extended to 1 August 2025.\n> 2On 31 July 2025, the US announced a revised set of reciprocal tariffs that accounted for the trade deals struck, in addition to reaffirming that baseline tariffs of 10 per cent would continue to be imposed on countries not subjected to the reciprocal tariffs. The reciprocal tariffs have since come into effect on 7 August 2025.\n> 3During the 90-day truce from 14 May to 12 August 2025, the US’ tariff on China is lowered from 145 per cent to 30 per cent, and China’s retaliatory tariff on the US is reduced from 125 per cent to 10 per cent. The US and China held further negotiations in Stockholm on 28 and 29 July 2025 to discuss an extension of the tariff truce, among other trade issues. 3\n\nsecond half of 2025 due to the impact of the US’ reciprocal tariffs on their exports and as domestic demand softens in some economies. \n\nMore importantly, significant uncertainties remain in the global economy due in part to the continued unpredictability of the US’ trade policies, including the timing and extent of the sectoral tariffs on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Overall, the balance of risks in the global economy is skewed to the downside. First, a re-escalation \n\nof tariff actions could lead to a renewed spike in economic uncertainty, and cause businesses and households to pull back sharply on spending and hiring. Second, a shock \n\nto financial markets resulting from a sharper-than-expected tightening of global \n\nfinancial conditions could lead to destabilising capital flows that trigger latent \n\nvulnerabilities in banking and financial systems. Third, potential escalations in \n\ngeopolitical tensions could lead to supply disruptions in energy commodities and renewed pressures on global energy prices. \n\nAgainst this backdrop , Singapore’s economic growth is expected to slow in the second half of the year compared to the first half because of slower growth in outward-oriented sectors. In particular, the pace of growth in the manufacturing sector is projected to weaken in the coming quarters as the US’ tariff measures weigh on demand in global end-markets. Nevertheless, there remain some bright spots within the sector, namely the transport engineering cluster given the sustained shift towards higher value-added aircraft maintenance, repair & overhaul works in Singapore, as well as the precision engineering cluster due to the continued ramp-up in capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers producing AI-related semiconductors. \n\nGrowth in the wholesale trade sector is similarly expected to slow for the rest of 2025 as the lift from front-loading activities in the region wanes and global trade softens. These factors will also weigh on the transportation & storage sector through their drag on the demand for shipping and air cargo services. \n\nMeanwhile, growth in the finance & insurance sector is likely to be dampened by weaker credit demand and lower payment transaction volumes due to fragile business confidence and tepid consumer spending. Nonetheless, bullish market sentiment could keep trading activity buoyant and provide some upsides to growth. \n\nFinally, growth in consumer-facing sectors such as retail trade and food & beverage services is likely to remain lacklustre for the rest of the year, weighed down by the continued shift in locals’ spending abroad and the projected weakening of domestic labour market conditions. \n\nGiven the better-than-expected performance of the Singapore economy in the first half of the year, and considering the projected softening of both the global and domestic 4\n\neconomies in the second half of the year, MTI has upgraded Singapore’s GDP growth forecast for 2025 from  “0.0 to 2.0 per cent”  to “1.5 to 2.5 per cent” . However, Singapore’s economic outlook for the rest of the year remains clouded by uncertainty, with the risks tilted to the downside. 4 MTI will continue to monitor developments in the global and domestic economies closely, and make adjustments to the forecast if necessary over the course of the year. \n\nMINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY \n\n12 August 2025  \n\n> 4\n\nLeading indicators point to early signs of slowing momentum and weakening sentiments in the economy. For instance, DOS’ composite leading index fell by 0.5 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the second quarter of 2025, a pullback from the 1.2 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index turned slightly contractionary in July, driven by declines in the new orders, production and employment sub-indices. MOM’s hiring and wage expectations survey indicates softening sentiments, with the proportion of firms in June expecting to hire in the next three months edging down to 43.7 per cent, from 44.0 per cent in March. Similarly, the proportion of firms expecting to raise wages in the next three months fell to 22.4 per cent, from 24.4 per cent over the same period. 5\n\nANNEX A \n\nEconomic Performance by Sectors in Second Quarter 2025 \n\nThe manufacturing sector expanded by 5.2 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, \n\nfollowing the 4.7 per cent growth in the previous quarter. Growth during the quarter was driven by output expansions across all clusters except for the chemicals and general manufacturing clusters. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector shrank by 0.4 per cent, extending the 5.2 per cent contraction in the preceding quarter. \n\nGrowth in the construction sector came in at 6.0 per cent year-on-year, faster than the \n\n4.9 per cent expansion in the first quarter. Growth during the quarter was supported by expansions in both public sector and private sector construction output. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector grew by 5.7 per cent, a reversal from the 2.0 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. \n\nThe wholesale trade sector grew by 4.7 per cent year-on-year, picking up from the 4.0 \n\nper cent growth in the preceding quarter. Growth of the sector was led by the machinery, equipment & supplies segment on the back of robust growth in the wholesale volumes of electronic components and telecommunications & computers. At the same time, the fuels & chemicals segment expanded on account of an increase in the wholesale sales of petroleum & petroleum products. The “others” 5 segment similarly posted growth during the quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector grew by 2.8 per cent, a turnaround from the 0.5 per cent contraction in the first quarter. \n\nThe retail trade sector recorded growth of 0.7 per cent year-on-year, extending the 0.3 \n\nper cent expansion in the previous quarter. Growth during the quarter was supported by an increase in motor vehicular sales volumes which outweighed a decline in non-motor vehicular sales volumes. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector shrank by 1.4 per cent, a reversal from the 2.0 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. \n\nGrowth in the transportation & storage sector slowed to 5.1 per cent year-on-year, from \n\n6.2 per cent in the first quarter. Within the sector, the air transport segment continued to expand, with the total number of air passengers handled at Changi Airport during the quarter growing on a year-on-year basis. Meanwhile, the water transport segment also registered growth, supported by an increase in container throughput, which more than offset a decline in sea cargo handled at Singapore’s ports. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector grew by 0.7 per cent, moderating from the 3.9 per cent expansion in the previous quarter.  \n\n> 5The “others” segment comprises a diverse range of products including metals, timber & construction materials, household equipment & furniture as well as food, beverages & tobacco, among others.\n\n6\n\nThe accommodation sector grew by 2.4 per cent year-on-year, a turnaround from the \n\n1.1 per cent contraction in the preceding quarter. Growth of the sector came on the back of an increase in total gross lettings over the same period, which was in turn led by higher gross lettings in the luxury and mid-tier hotel segments. By contrast, gross lettings in the upscale hotel segment declined. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector expanded by 1.1 per cent, a reversal from the 1.0 per cent contraction in the first quarter. \n\nThe food & beverage services sector shrank by 0.5 per cent year-on-year, extending the \n\n0.7 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. The weak performance of the sector during the quarter was due to a fall in sales volumes at restaurants and fast-food outlets, which more than offset an increase in sales volumes at food caterers and cafes, food courts & other eating places. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector contracted by 0.7 per cent, extending the 0.6 per cent decline in the preceding quarter. \n\nGrowth in the information & communications sector eased to 4.2 per cent year-on-year, \n\nfrom 4.8 per cent in the first quarter. The sector’s growth during the quarter was primarily driven by expansions in the IT & information services and “others” 6 segments, \n\nwith the former supported by data hosting and internet search engine activities, and the latter by games publishing activities . On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector grew by 3.1 per cent, reversing the 3.0 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. \n\nThe finance & insurance sector expanded by 4.2 per cent year-on-year, extending the \n\n4.1 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. Growth was largely supported by the banking and activities auxiliary to financial services segments. The former grew as net fees and commissions continued to increase by double-digits, albeit less strongly when compared to the first quarter likely due in part to tepid investment banking activity amidst heightened macroeconomic uncertainty. Meanwhile, growth in the latter, which comprises mainly the payments players, likely reflected an increase in cross-border transactions alongside a pickup in global trade activity. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector shrank marginally by 0.1 per cent, moderating from the 1.4 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. \n\nThe real estate sector grew by 5.2 per cent year-on-year, slower than the 7.5 per cent \n\nexpansion in the first quarter. Growth of the sector was largely supported by the private residential property segment. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the  \n\n> 6The “others” segment consists of (i) publishing activities (including computer games and software publishing), (ii) motion picture, video and other programme production, sound recording, and music publishing activities, and (iii) radio and television broadcasting activities. 7\n\nsector posted a contraction of 1.8 per cent, a pullback from the 4.6 per cent expansion in the preceding quarter. \n\nThe professional services sector expanded by 3.3 per cent year-on-year, faster than the \n\n1.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter. Growth was mainly driven by expansions in the head offices & business representative offices and other professional, scientific & technical services segments. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector recorded slower growth of 0.6 per cent compared to the 1.1 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. \n\nThe administrative & support services sector grew by 2.6 per cent year-on-year, \n\nextending the 2.1 per cent growth in the first quarter. Growth during the quarter was led by expansions in the rental & leasing, security & cleaning services and other business support services segments.

Today, it is one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Its GDP per capita has risen to an incredible U.S. $60,000, making it one of the strongest economies in the world. For a small country with few natural resources, Singapore's economic ascension is nothing short of remarkable. By embracing globalization, free-market capitalism, education, and pragmatic policies, the country has been able to overcome its geographic disadvantages and become a leader in global commerce.\n\nGaining Independence\n--------------------\n\nFor over 100 years, Singapore was under British control. But when the British failed to protect the colony from the Japanese during [World War II](https://www.thoughtco.com/world-war-ii-4133274), it sparked a strong anti-colonial and nationalist sentiment that subsequently led to Singapore's independence.\n\nOn August 31, 1963, [Singapore seceded from the British crown](https://www.thoughtco.com/faq-about-singapore-195082) and merged with Malaysia to form the Federation of Malaysia. The two years Singapore spent as part of Malaysia were filled with social strife, as the two sides struggled to assimilate with one another ethnically. Street riots and violence became very common. The Chinese in Singapore outnumbered the Malay three-to-one. The Malay politicians in Kuala Lumpur feared their heritage and political ideologies were being threatened by the growing Chinese population throughout the island and peninsula. Therefore, as a way of ensuring a Malay majority within [Malaysia](https://www.thoughtco.com/malaysia-facts-and-history-195593) proper and to limit the influence of communism, the Malaysian parliament voted to expel Singapore from Malaysia. Singapore gained formal independence on August 9, 1965, with Yusof bin Ishak serving as its first president and the highly influential Lee Kuan Yew as its prime minister.\n\nAfter independence, Singapore continued to experience problems. Much of the city-state's 3 million people were unemployed. More than two-thirds of its population was living in slums and squatter settlements on the city's fringe. The territory was sandwiched between two large and unfriendly states in Malaysia and [Indonesia](https://www.thoughtco.com/geography-of-indonesia-1435052). Singapore lacked natural resources, sanitation, proper infrastructure, and adequate water supply. In order to stimulate development, Lee sought international assistance, but his pleas went unanswered, leaving Singapore to fend for itself.\n\nGlobalizing Industry and Trade\n------------------------------\n\nDuring colonial times, Singapore's economy was centered on entrepôt trade. But this economic activity offered little prospect for job expansion in the post-colonial period. The withdrawal of the British further aggravated the unemployment situation.\n\nThe most feasible solution to Singapore's economic and unemployment woes was to embark on a comprehensive program of industrialization, with a focus on labor-intensive industries. Unfortunately, Singapore had no industrial tradition. The majority of its working population was in trade and services. Therefore, they had no expertise or easily adaptable skills. Moreover, without a hinterland and neighbors who would trade with it, Singapore was forced to look for opportunities well beyond its borders to spearhead its industrial development.\n\nPressured to find work for their people, the leaders of Singapore began to experiment with [globalization](https://www.thoughtco.com/globalization-positive-and-negative-1434946). Influenced by Israel's ability to leap over its Arab neighbors (who boycotted Israel) and trade with Europe and America, Lee and his colleagues knew they had to connect with the developed world and convince multinational corporations to manufacture in Singapore.\n\nCentralizing Government\n-----------------------\n\nIn order to attract investors, Singapore had to create an environment that was safe, corruption-free, and low in taxation. To make this feasible, the citizens of the country had to suspend a large measure of their freedom in place of a more autocratic government. Anyone caught conducting narcotic trade or intensive corruption would be met with the death penalty. Lee's People Action Party (PAP) repressed all independent labor unions and consolidated what remained into a single umbrella group called the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC), which the party directly controlled. Individuals who threatened national, political, or corporate unity were quickly jailed without much due process. The country's draconian, but business-friendly laws became very appealing to international investors. In contrast to its neighbors, where political and economic climates were unpredictable, Singapore was very stable. Moreover, with its advantageous location and established port system, Singapore was an ideal place to manufacture goods.\n\nSecuring Investors\n------------------\n\nBy 1972, just seven years after independence, one-quarter of Singapore's manufacturing firms were either foreign-owned or joint-venture companies, and both the United States and Japan were major investors. As a result of Singapore's steady climate, favorable investment conditions and the rapid expansion of the world economy from 1965 to 1972, the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) experienced annual double-digit growth.\n\nAs foreign investment money poured in, Singapore began focusing on developing its human resources in addition to its infrastructure. The country set up many technical schools and paid international corporations to train their unskilled workers in information technology, petrochemicals, and electronics. For those who could not get industrial jobs, the government enrolled them in labor-intensive un-tradable services, such as tourism and transportation. The strategy of having multinationals educate their workforce paid great dividends for the country. In the 1970s, Singapore was primarily exporting textiles, garments, and basic electronics. By the 1990s, they were engaging in wafer fabrication, logistics, biotech research, pharmaceuticals, integrated circuit design, and aerospace engineering.\n\nCreating a Market Economy\n-------------------------\n\nToday, Singapore is a modern, industrialized society and entrepôt trade continues to play a central role in its economy. The Port of Singapore is now the [world's busiest transshipment port](https://www.thoughtco.com/geography-4133035), surpassing Hong Kong and Rotterdam. In terms of total cargo tonnage handled, it has become the world's second busiest, behind only the Port of Shanghai.\n\nSingapore's tourism industry is also thriving, attracting over 10 million visitors annually. The city-state now has a zoo, a night safari, and a nature reserve. The country has opened two of the world's most expensive integrated casino resorts in the Marina Bay Sands and the Resorts World Sentosa. The country's medical tourism and culinary tourism industries have also become quite successful, thanks to Singapore's cultural heritage and advanced medical technology.\n\nBanking has grown significantly in recent years and many assets formerly held in Switzerland have been moved to Singapore due to new taxes imposed by the Swiss. The biotech industry is burgeoning, with drug makers such as GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, and Merck & Co. all establishing plants there, and oil refining continues to play a huge role in the economy.\n\nHow Singapore Has Grown\n-----------------------\n\nDespite its small size, Singapore is now the 15th largest trading partner of the United States. The country has established strong trade agreements with several countries in South America, Europe, and Asia as well. There are currently over 3,000 multinational corporations operating in the country, accounting for more than two-thirds of its manufacturing output and direct export sales.\n\nWith a total land area of just 433 square miles and a small labor force of 3 million people, Singapore is able to produce a GDP that exceeds $300 billion annually, higher than three-quarters of the world. Life expectancy is 83.75 years, the third-highest in the world. Singapore is considered to be one of the best places to live on Earth if you don't mind the strict rules.\n\nSingapore's model of sacrificing freedom for business is highly controversial and heavily debated. Regardless of philosophy, though, its effectiveness is undeniable.\n",

Click\nhere (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2023/china/part-1-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-standard-contract-for-gba-data-transfers)\nto read the Part I of this Article.\nBACKGROUND\n(See Part I of this Article)\nKEY PROVISIONS AND OBSERVATIONS\nLegal Effect and Application\n(see Part I of this Article)\nKey Provisions\nCompliance Obligations\nBefore carrying out cross-border transfers through entering into GBA SCCs, PI Processors\n[1]\nin the GBA must comply with the following actions:\n1. Fully informing the PI subject and obtaining a legal basis\n(such as consent): This should be carried out in accordance with the relevant local laws and regulations of the PI Processor’s jurisdiction. If the local laws and regulations do not require notification, then their provisions should be followed.\n2. Conducting a Personal Information Protection Impact Assessment (“PIPIA”)\nBefore carrying out cross-border transfers of PI under the GBA SCCs, PI Processors (including data users in Hong Kong) must conduct a PIPIA. The GBA SCC Guidelines do not currently stipulate that the PIPIA conducted for the purpose of entering into GBA SCCs needs to be submitted to local authorities. This remains a procedural distinction from the practice under PIPL SCCs, where the PIPIA conducted has to be submitted to the CAC together with the signed PIPL SCCs.\nFor data users in Hong Kong, carrying out a PIPIA is not required under the PDPO. The PCPD only recommends a non-compulsory Privacy Impact Assessment (“\nPIA\n”) before launching new businesses or projects that may have a significant impact on personal data privacy. However, it should be noted that the “Policy Statement on Facilitating Data Flow and Safeguarding Data Security in Hong Kong” mentioned that the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau will consider possible amendments to the PDPO to align legislation with the latest international developments in privacy protection. Thus, the PDPO may incorporate international practices and mandate PIA as a compliance requirement in certain situations.\nKey Assessment Area\n:\nThe legality, legitimacy and necessity of the purposes and means, etc. of processing PI by the PI Processor and recipient (In contrast to the PIPL SCCs, the assessment of the “scope” of PI processing is not considered);\nThe impact on the rights and interests of PI subjects, as well as the security risk to PI subjects (cf. the PIPL SCCs which contain more detailed requirements\n[2]\n);\nWhether the obligations undertaken by the recipient and its management and technical measures and capabilities can ensure the level of security measures to be applied to the PI in question.\nThe assessment of the impact of the PI protection policies and regulations of the recipient’s country or region on the performance of the standard contract is not required under the GBA SCC Guidelines which is an obligation stipulated under the PIPL SCCs. This means the GBA SCCs mechanism does not require the evaluation of the legal environment of PI protection in the recipient jurisdiction, an exercise entailed in a customary transfer impact assessment in international data transfer mechanisms.\nPIPIA Time Limit\n: In line with the PIPL SCCs guidelines, the PIPIA must be completed within three months before the filing date, and no major changes should have taken place as of the filing date.\nPIPIA Template\n: At present, neither the Guangdong CAC nor Hong Kong authorities have issued a PIPIA report outline or template under the GBA SCCs mechanism. We will keep a watching brief on the upcoming filing guidelines from the Guangdong CAC, which may provide guidance for PIPIA implementation for Hong Kong’s data users.\n3.\nSigning the GBA SCCs with the recipient according to the template\nThe GBA SCCs must strictly adhere to Appendix I of the GBA SCC Guidelines. While the PI Processor can negotiate additional terms with the recipient, these terms must not contradict the GBA SCCs. In case of any\ndiscrepancies\nbetween the GBA SCCs and other legal agreements, the GBA SCCs takes precedence. For specific business arrangements, separate commercial contracts can be established.\nThe GBA SCCs template is currently designed for one-way data transfers. Hence, if a cross-border data exchange\ninvolves\ntransfers from Mainland China to Hong Kong and vice versa, it would necessitate the signing of two distinct GBA SCCs to accommodate each direction of transfer.\nKey differences\nbetween\nthe GBA SCCs and PIPL SCCs include:\nGBA SCCs restrict cross-border PI transfers to within the GBA, unlike the PIPL SCCs.\nGBA SCCs have relaxed requirements for providing PI to GBA third parties, with no need to ensure their activities meet China’s PI protection standards or to provide individuals with copies of agreements with the third party.\nGBA SCCs have removed clauses concerning the impact of the local PI protection policies and regulations of the recipient’s country or region on contract performance. If local policy or regulation changes prevent the recipient from fulfilling the GBA SCCs, the recipient can't unilaterally terminate the GBA SCCs.\nGBA SCCs emphasise the application of local laws, e.g., informing individuals and obtaining consent must comply with local laws. In disputes, individuals can choose to apply the laws of the PI Processor's jurisdiction and file lawsuits in Mainland China or Hong Kong based on their respective laws\nAs per Article 6 of the GBA SCC Guidelines, cross-border PI transfers may only occur once the GBA SCCs are effective.\nAdditionally\n, a filing with the local regulatory authority is required within ten working days from the GBA SCCs’ effective date, and a filing reference number must be obtained before any cross-border PI transfer, as confirmed with the Guangdong CAC.\n4. Filing the GBA SCCs with the local regulatory authority\nWho is responsible for the Filing?\nUnder GBA SCCs, both PI Processors and recipients shall file with their local authorities, unlike PIPL SCCs where only Mainland PI Processors are required to file. This measure may be to monitor recipients’ implementation based on the GBA SCCs, especially in relation to data onward transfers within the GBA.\nThe Guangdong CAC has indicated that one party filing under GBA SCCs may suffice, but this requires Hong Kong authorities’ confirmation. Notably, the OGCIO issued the Filing Guidelines on the Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)\n[3]\n(“\nHong Kong Filing Guidelines\n”), which are silent on this issue but have referred to two separate sets of filing procedures for both Hong Kong-based PI Processors and recipients.  Whether this in practice means a Hong Kong recipient is expected to conduct a local filing in addition to the CAC filing already made by a PI Processor based in Mainland China remains to be seen.\nFor Hong Kong data users and recipients, using the GBA SCCs mechanism means increased filing responsibilities. However, the PCPD’s RMCs\n[4] (file:///C:/Users/jwrl/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/2EI13Z19/Save%20the%20Best%20for%20Last%20--%20All%20You%20need%20to%20Know%20about%20the%20Standard%20Contract%20for%20GBA%20Data%20Transfers%20(Part%20II)%20-%20EN%20-%20BB.docx#_ftn4)\nwhich are more concise and flexible than GBA SCCs, do not require filing with the regulatory authority.\nWhich regulatory authority will handle the Filing?\nPI Processors and recipients shall file with the Guangdong CAC or the OGCIO in the Hong Kong according to their respective jurisdictions and submit the required filing documents.\nThe Hong Kong Filing Guidelines are only applicable to contracting parties in Hong Kong,  including data users or recipients.\nThe Guangdong CAC is expected to issue filing guidelines in the near future, which will be applicable to PI Processors and recipients in the nine Mainland cities of the GBA.\nFiling Documents\nPhotocopy of Identity proof of the legal representatives\nUndertaking (see Template at Appendix II of the GBA SCC Guidelines); and\nThe GBA SCCs (Chinese version).\nHong Kong OGCIO has provided a separate application form for filing, and the Guangdong CAC may also develop corresponding filing application forms, requiring PI Processors to provide their contact information.\nPending confirmation from upcoming the Guangdong CAC filing guidelines, it appears that the above filing documents do not require a PIPIA report, suggesting more flexibility in the PIPIA of the GBA SCCs in form and content compared to the PIPIA under the PIPL SCCs.  Despite this, authorities may still review the PIPIA report during cross-border transfers and request rectification depending on the situation.\nFiling Process\nThe filing process may include the submission of documents, the checking of documents, notification of filing results, the provision of supplementary information and carrying out the re-filing procedures.\nSubmission of Documents: the parties shall conduct the filing procedures within ten working days from the effective date of the GBA SCCs.\nFeedback timeline: The feedback timeline for Mainland parties is pending the release of the relevant rules by Guangdong CAC. The Hong Kong Filing Guidelines outline the following filing procedure timeline:\nFor data user applications, the OGCIO will provide filing results within ten working days of receiving filing documents. If approved, a filing reference number will be issued. If not, the data user will be notified, and it may re-file with supplementary documents within ten working days.\nFor recipient applications, the OGCIO will acknowledge receipt and document completeness within ten working days of receiving filing documents.\nDuring the effective term of the GBA SCCs, PI Processors and recipients in the GBA should perform the following obligations:\n1. PI Processors in the GBA should promptly re-conduct a PIPIA, enter into a supplemental agreement or a new GBA SCCs, and conduct the corresponding filing procedures, should the following occur:\nThe purpose, scope, categories, means, or the recipient’s use and means of PI processing changes, or the retention period is extended. (Compared to the PIPL SCCs, changes in sensitivity and retention location are not mentioned.)\nThe occurrence of any other circumstances that affect or may affect the rights and interests in relation to PI. (Compared to the PIPL SCCs, changes in the PI protection policies and regulations of the recipient’s country or region that may affect PI rights and interests are not mentioned. This aligns with the GBA SCCs’ PIPIA, which does not require an assessment of the legal environment of the recipient’s country or region.)\n2. PI Processors and recipients in the GBA shall be supervised and managed by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdiction concerned.\nBelow is a brief introduction of regulatory authorities in Hong Kong regarding their hierarchy and responsibilities related to cross-border data flows in the GBA:\nThe OGCIO’s responsibilities for GBA SCC Guidelines implementation include:\nIssuing guidance on GBA SCCs implementation and Pilot Implementation.\nAccepting GBA SCCs filings from Hong Kong contracting parties and the Express of Interest Form for Pilot Implementation.\nHandling complaints and reports about improper performance of GBA SCC Guidelines obligations.\nTaking follow-up actions on GBA SCC Guidelines violations, including requesting necessary rectification from the PI Processor or recipient.\nCollaborating with the PCPD, and referring PDPO violation cases to the PCPD for further investigation and handling.\nPI Processors and recipients in the GBA shall accept supervision and management by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdiction concerned during the implementation of the GBA SCCs, specifically including:\nPI Processors must respond to regulatory enquiries, prove GBA SCCs obligations fulfilment, and must notify authorities when terminating GBA SCCs (PIPL SCCs only require notification as necessary).\nRecipients are supervised by regulatory authorities and must answer enquiries, cooperate with inspections, comply with decisions, and provide proof of actions taken. If local government or judicial bodies request PI under GBA SCCs, it shall notify PI Processor immediately.\nIn case of a security incident such as a PI breach, immediate remedial measures must be taken and regulatory authorities must be notified. The GBA SCCs and PIPL SCCs have identical notification contents.\nRegulatory authorities may request rectification from PI Processors or recipients if high security risks or incidents are identified in the cross-border processing of PI. Cases requiring involvement of other law enforcement will be referred in accordance with the law.\nThe roles of Mainland and Hong Kong’s data protection authorities in enhancing data protection, handling complaints, investigating, and addressing unlawful data processing remain unaffected by these rules.\nIf a Hong Kong recipient violates the GBA SCC Guidelines by transferring PI outside the GBA, the OGCIO will follow up on reports or complaints. They may require rectification, with the recipient expected to cooperate, comply, and provide proof of actions taken. If there is any behaviour in violation of the PDPO, the PCPD will follow up and handle the case according to the PDPO.\nImplementation Measures\nThe OGCIO of Hong Kong intended to launch a Pilot Implementation of the GBA SCCs in December 2023, with the first phase openly inviting participants from banking, credit referencing and healthcare sectors. The Hong Kong government will review the Pilot Implementation in due course and expand the facilitation measures to other sectors.\nIndividuals or enterprises who are interested in participating in the Pilot Implementation must submit their Expression of Interest Form before December 31, 2023.\nAccording to the Expression of Interest Form, any PI Processor or recipient can apply to participate, regardless of industry, and applicants are not limited to banks, credit referencing, and healthcare sectors. In addition, individual PI Processors or recipients can also participate in the Pilot Implementation.\nCONCLUSION\nThe clear policy intention of the GBA SCC Guidelines to facilitate the transfer of PI from Mainland China to Hong Kong should be understood in the context of any potential impact on the compliance costs.  Examples discussed above include the need to conduct the PIPIA for Hong Kong data users and the need for both Mainland China and Hong Kong-based parties to file with their respective local authorities.\nIt is important to note that Mainland China-based PI Processors can still export data via the existing mechanism pursuant to the PIPL. If data flow does not need to extend beyond the GBA, they can opt for GBA SCCs or GBA Certification mechanisms as needed. They should monitor Guangdong CAC’s upcoming filing guidelines and regulatory development on potential exemptions of the data export compliance obligations.\nFor Hong Kong data users transferring data to Mainland China, the need to rely on the GBA SCCs will inevitably be a case-by-case assessment.  This is likely to depend on the organisation’s existing compliance logic for international data transfers, particularly if intra-group data transfer impact assessment and transfer agreements can be leveraged upon, which will be a natural option for mitigating against any additional potential compliance cost. Relevant stakeholders are advised to monitor any upcoming PDPO revisions and participate in the Pilot Implementation to provide feedback\n.\n[1]\nAccording to the GBA SCCs, PI Processors, for the Mainland China, refers to an organisation or individual that autonomously determines the purposes and means of PI processing; for the HKSAR, it also covers a “data user” which, in relation to personal data, means a person who, either alone or jointly or in common with other persons, controls the collection, holding, processing or use of the data.\n[2]\nThe PIPL SCCs also requires PI Processors to assess the risks in more detail, including the quantity, scope, type, and sensitivity of PI to be transferred overseas, and the risk that the outbound cross-border transfer may pose to PI rights and interests; the risk of the PI being tampered with, sabotaged, disclosed, lost, or illegally used after the it is transferred overseas, and whether there is a smooth channel for protecting the rights and interests in the PI.\n[3]\nFiling Guidelines on the Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (ogcio.gov.hk) (https://www.ogcio.gov.hk/en/our_work/business/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc02_fg_en.pdf)\n[4]\nMedia Statement - PCPD Publishes Guidance on Personal Data Protection in Cross-border Data Transfer (https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/news_events/media_statements/press_20141229.html)\n;\nMedia Statement - PCPD Issues Guidance on Recommended Model Contractual Clauses for Cross-border Transfers of Personal Data (https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/news_events/media_statements/press_20220512.html)\nLatest insights\nMore Insights (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights)\nReshaping the Game: An EU-Focused Legal Guide to Generative and Agentic AI in Gaming\n30 minutes\nAug 14 2025\nRead More (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/reshaping-the-game-an-eu-focused-legal-guide-to-generative-and-agentic-ai-in-gaming)\nAn In-depth Analysis of China’s Network Data Security Regime Part III: Cross-Border Data Transfer and Platform Data Protection\nAug 14 2025\nRead More (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/china/an-indepth-analysis-of-chinas-network-data-security-regime-part-iii)\nA decision of epic proportions: Federal Court finds that app store providers contravened Australia’s competition laws\nAug 14 2025\nRead More (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/australia/a-decision-of-epic-proportions)\nMore Insights (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights)\nPreviousPart 1 (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2023/china/part-1-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-standard-contract-for-gba-data-transfers)\n[No Text] (https://www.twobirds.com/en/)\nBack to Top (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/china/save-the-best-for-last-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-standard-contract-for-gba)\nMain Navigation (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/china/save-the-best-for-last-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-standard-contract-for-gba#accordion-1)\nPeople (https://www.twobirds.com/en/people)\nCapabilities (https://www.twobirds.com/en/capabilities)\nInsights (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights)\nAbout (https://www.twobirds.com/en/about)\nReach (https://www.twobirds.com/en/reach)\nCareers (https://www.twobirds.com/en/careers)\nQuick Links (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/china/save-the-best-for-last-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-standard-contract-for-gba#accordion-2)\nTrending Topics (https://www.twobirds.com/en/trending-topics)\nBlogs (https://www.twobirds.com/en/blogs)\nJoin Us (https://www.twobirds.com/en/careers)\nAlumni (https://www.twobirds.com/en/about/alumni)\nTwoBirds TV (https://www.twobirds.com/en/twobirds-tv)\nClient Solutions (https://www.twobirds.com/en/capabilities/client-solutions)\nNews & Deals (https://www.twobirds.com/en/news-and-deals)\nContact (https://www.twobirds.com/en/contact)\nLegal (https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/china/save-the-best-for-last-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-standard-contract-for-gba#accordion-3)\nTerms of use (https://www.twobirds.com/en/more-information/terms-and-conditions-of-use)\nCookies (https://www.twobirds.com/en/more-information/cookies-policy)\nLegal Notices (https://www.twobirds.com/en/more-information/legal-notices)\nPrivacy (https://www.twobirds.com/en/more-information/privacy)\nScam Communications (https://www.twobirds.com/en/more-information/warning--suspicious-letters-and-e-mails)\nAccessibility (https://www.twobirds.com/en/more-information/accessibility)\nModern slavery statement (https://www.twobirds.com/en/more-information/modern-slavery-act)\n© 2025 Bird & Bird\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/318488)\nWeChat (https://www.twobirds.com/-/media/twobirdssite/navigation/wechat-qr-code.jpg)\nSubscribe (https://www.twobirds.com/en/about/subscribe)\nOFFICE TELEPHONE LIST (https://www.twobirds.com/en/contact/office-telephone-list)",

However, despite the significant business opportunities, the GBA also faces challenges and uncertainties.\nComposed of the two Special Administrative Regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macao and the nine municipalities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Zhaoqing in Guangdong Province, the GBA covers an area of 56,500 km2, with a population of about 72 million people.\n[No Text] (https://www.woodburnglobal.com/independent-director)\nWhile the GBA is expected to create business opportunities across all sectors, experts believe that three main areas will benefit the most: technology and innovation, trade and logistics and financial services.\nThe GBA is a China policy initiative aimed at promoting closer cooperation and coordination between 11 cities of the Pearl River Delta among which, Hong Kong, Macao, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou would be their main centers.\nThe plan emerged in 2015, as part of the China Belt and Road Initiative. In 2016, it was isolated as a distinct project and included in China 13th Five-Year Plan for 2016-2020. On February 18th, 2019, the Chinese Government issued its Outline Development Plan for the GBA, which intends to guide current and future developments within an ecosystem integrated both physically and digitally.\nWith a total GDP of USD 1.56 trillion, the size of the GBA economy is close to Russia’s, larger than Australia’s, and just behind that of Korea.\nGuangdong Province alone generates 14% of China national GDP; and the Pearl River Delta region is now the largest urban area in the world, overtaking Tokyo. The goal of the GBA initiative is to create a city cluster offering regional competitive advantages, rivaling with those of New York, San Francisco, or Tokyo.\nThe GBA brings unique opportunities for tech companies and aims to become a world-class center for innovation, science and technology, infrastructural connectivity, financial integration and social betterment with smart cities and an advanced manufacturing and IT powerhouse.\nThere are four important areas in which the Outline Development Plan intends to foster cooperation: Innovation & Technology, Infrastructural Connectivity, Financial Integration, and Social Betterment.\nRegarding the first one, the idea is to develop the “Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macao” innovation and technology corridor and major carriers for innovation such as the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park.\nThe second one would seek to connect the Mainland with Hong Kong and Macao, as well as connecting the east and west coasts of the Pearl River Delta and build a rapid inter-city transport network mainly focused on high-speed rails, inter-city railway and highways.\nThe financial integration would promote cross-boundary transactions of insurance products within the Greater Bay Area, establishing a mechanism for mutual access to capital and products, and support Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao insurance institutions in developing cross-boundary RMB reinsurance business.\nThe area of social betterment is meant to support Hong Kong and Macao investors in setting up pension and other social services facilities through sole proprietorship, joint-venture, cooperation, etc. in the nine municipalities in accordance with regulations.\n[No Text] (https://meetings.hubspot.com/kristina12?uuid=6e853743-b6d2-476f-8026-a185209f5a6e)\nThe GBA plan will offer Hong Kong the possibility of redefining its role as an international financial center. Thanks to its status as international connector, Hong Kong should naturally be able to promote the GBA initiative overseas and attract more capital and talents therein.\nOn the other hand, Hong Kong should take advantage of its financial leadership and of the opportunities offered by the 9 Mainland Chinese cities of the GBA in terms of market reach, industrial system, and technological developments.\nThe GBA has the potential to extend its reach beyond the Pearl River Delta region. In the longer term, it should be able to act as a catalyst for China’s broader Belt and Road Initiative, where Hong Kong should strengthen its role as a global offshore RMB center.\nOne of the challenges is cross-border payments and transfers of data, regional taxation, and regulations on foreign-direct investments. The example of data transfers illustrates the complexity of the issue: while Hong Kong regulations on data privacy try to draw a balance between the protection of individuals and the promotion of trade and economic developments, China Cybersecurity Law emphasizes the protection of national interest and security.\nThanks to the size and economic potential of the GBA, numerous sectors will see as well in increase of opportunities, such as infrastructure, construction, real estate, financial services, insurance, capital markets, and many others.\nTo fully take advantage of these opportunities, businesses should carefully evaluate the potential impacts of GBA integration and develop comprehensive business policies based on the connectivity of the area and flows of goods, talent, and resources within it.\nThe policy framework of the GBA is ambitious, dynamic, and subject to interpretation and negotiation by policy actors at different levels. Its progress is supported by a triple “I” strategy of integration, innovation, and internationalization.\nThe initiative aims to promote China’s two Special Administration Regions’ economic and cultural integration with the Chinese mainland under the “one country, two systems” framework. Deeper cooperation for Hong Kong, Macao, and the mainland will be mutually beneficial.\nThe GBA constitutes part of a nationwide regional development strategy framework to build an innovation economy. China will pursue a structural rebalancing from a labor intensive, low investment, export-oriented economy to a high-tech manufacturing, and service-based economy that relies more on domestic consumption.\n[No Text] (https://www.woodburnglobal.com/woodburn-short-articles)\nThanks to the GBA’s leading industries in manufacturing, financial services, and technological innovation, the region represents a new momentum for China’s economic growth, a new channel for it to be engaged with the global economy and thereby a new engine for China’s economic growth. The GBA also serves as a catalyst for promoting China’s economic internationalization. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China stressed that “Openness brings progress, while self-seclusion leaves one behind”.\nAs the most open region to the outside world, the Greater Bay Area has an advantage in global economic positioning and it will play a key role in the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as shoulder the responsibility of piloting more reforms to help China internationalize its economy.\nWoodburn Accountants & Advisors is one of China’s most trusted business setup advisory firms.\nWoodburn Accountants & Advisors is specialized in inbound investment to China and Hong Kong.

(https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore)\nThe World Bank In Singapore\nMore than 50 years ago, Singapore was confronted with high unemployment, poor infrastructure, and an uncertain future. Today, the city-state is home to a high-income, globally competitive economy that is underpinned by one of the highest levels of human capital development in the world.\nSingapore Home (https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore)\nOverview\nOverview\nSummary (https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore/overview#1)\nPartnership (https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore/overview#2)\nOperations (https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore/overview#3)\nSingapore is a high-income economy built on a business-friendly regulatory environment and strong investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and public services. The city-state is among the world’s most competitive economies and ranks highest in the 2020 World Bank Human Capital Index.\nIn the decades after independence in 1965, Singapore rapidly developed from a low-income economy to a high-income economy. GDP growth in the city-state has been among the world’s highest, at an average of about 7% since independence and topping 9.2% in the first 25 years.\nAfter rapid industrialization in the 1960s lifted the island nation’s development trajectory, manufacturing became the main driver of growth. In the early 1970s, Singapore reached full employment and joined the ranks of Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, China, a decade later as Asia’s newly industrializing economies. The manufacturing and services sectors remain the twin pillars of Singapore’s high value-added economy.\nThe overall growth of the Singapore economy was 1.1% in 2023. Construction (+5.2% y-o-y) led the growth in goods- producing industries, driven by expansions in both public and private sector projects. Services industries registered broad-based growth, led by accommodation (+12.1% y-o-y), and information and communications (+5.7% y-o-y) on the back of strong international visitor arrivals and robust demand for data hosting services, respectively.  Economic growth is expected to be modest in 2024, with the government forecasting a range of 1% to 3%.\nIn February 2021, Singapore launched the “Singapore Green Plan 2030”, a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore's national agenda on sustainable development. The Green Plan charts ambitious and concrete targets over a 10-year period, strengthening Singapore's commitments under the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and Paris Agreement, and positioning Singapore to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\nIn the most recent\nWorld Bank Human Capital Index (https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital)\n, Singapore ranks as the best in the world in human capital development. Together with strong financial support from the government, the city-state continues to strengthen the nimbleness and flexibility of its workforce by providing continuing education such as the\nSkillsfuture (http://www.skillsfuture.sg/)\ninitiative.\nLast updated: July 2024\nSingapore became the 104th member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) on August 3, 1966. Prior to joining the World Bank Group, Singapore received its first loan in 1963 under guarantee from the U.K. government, and its second loan under guarantee from the Malaysian Federation, to which it then belonged. It received its third loan in 1966 after independence.\nOver the period 1963 and 1975, Singapore received 14 loans from the World Bank. All of the first 10 were for infrastructure, including water supply, port expansion, sewerage, power, and telecommunications.\nBy 1970, Singapore’s development focus expanded to investments in human capital and the services sector. The World Bank supported the capitalization of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), the establishment of environmental management programs, and the development of the national university while continuing to finance infrastructure projects. Singapore received its last financing from the World Bank in 1975. By the mid-1980s, it had repaid all its loans.\nToday, Singapore is a member of all five World Bank Group institutions and an important contributor to global initiatives such as the\nGlobal Infrastructure Facility (http://www.globalinfrafacility.org/)\nand the Climate Action Data Trust, as well as regional initiatives, such as the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility. It inspires many cities and countries striving to reach a similar level of development within a single generation.\nIn 1999, the World Bank Group opened its Singapore Office, in order to share knowledge with local networks. In 2009, it expanded the office with the establishment of the\nWorld Bank–Singapore Urban Hub (https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore/brief/world-bank-group-singapore-urban-hub)\n, which seeks to leverage the city-state’s expertise in sustainable urban development.\nTo strengthen its engagement with the private sector, in 2011 the partnership was expanded to include representatives from the\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) (https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home)\n(the private sector arm of the World Bank Group) and the\nMultilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) (https://www.miga.org/)\n(the arm of the institution that guarantees loans against political and risks). The Hub’s expansion continued, to include the Corporate Finance and Risk Management unit, IFC Treasury, IFC’s\nAsset Management Company (https://www.ifcamc.org/)\n, and the\nGlobal Infrastructure Facility (http://www.globalinfrafacility.org/)\n, among others.\nIn 2015,\nthe World Bank–Singapore Hub for Infrastructure and Urban Development (https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/10/27/singapore-world-bank-group-agree-to-establish-major-infrastructure-and-urban-development-hub)\nexpanded again recognizing the importance of high-quality, sustainable infrastructure and Singapore’s unique strength in facilitating opportunities for emerging and developing economies. In 2022, it added IBRD Treasury services, including sustainable finance; asset management; and client solutions, including the Reserve Advisory & Management Partnership program (RAMP), to support staff and clients across the East Asia and Pacific region.\nThe partnership between the World Bank Group and Singapore focuses on areas of mutual interest—including sustainable finance, global public goods, and long-term investments in infrastructure and human capital—with the aim of promoting broad-based economic growth across the region and combating the effects of climate change. The shared goal is to deliver knowledge and solutions to development challenges at impact and scale, in support of the World Bank Group’s mission to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity on a livable planet.\nLast updated: April 2025\nThe Singapore Office houses about 300 staff from the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA, making it one of the larger World Bank Group offices outside Washington, DC. It is a gateway through which clients across Asia access the full suite of Bank Group services.\nAs of the end of FY24, the Singapore Office managed more than $38 billion of World Bank lending operations and infrastructure verticals across Asia. Projects address cross-cutting global challenges such as climate change, energy transition, water security, air pollution, food security, and others. Teams based in Singapore also coordinate regional initiatives, such as the Southeast Asia Regional Program on Combating Marine Plastics.\nIFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, focuses on advancing cross-border investments and mobilizing capital from and through Singapore. It works closely with Monetary Authority of Singapore and other institutions to promote sustainability-linked investments and blended finance deployment to address climate financing gaps, scale up disruptive technologies, and incubate new business models. Examples of ongoing collaboration between IFC and Singapore include Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership (FAST-P) and the advancement of digital inclusion in emerging markets and developing countries.\nMIGA, the guarantees arm of the World Bank Group, seeks to promote foreign direct investments into developing countries to support economic growth. MIGA engages closely with the financing, investing, and insurance communities in Singapore to mobilize private capital for public goods by providing political risk insurance, credit guarantees, and trade finance guarantees for public sector risks. It also collaborates on relevant Singapore-led climate and infrastructure financing initiatives.\nThe World Bank Group is a regular contributor to Singapore’s flagship knowledge events, such as the\nWorld Cities Summit (https://www.worldcitiessummit.com.sg/)\n, the Asia Infrastructure Forum, Singapore\nInternational Water Week (https://www.siww.com.sg/)\n, Singapore\nInternational Energy Week (https://www.siew.sg/programme/associated-events/energy-access-forum)\n,\nEcosperity Week (https://www.ecosperity.sg/)\n, and\nSingapore Maritime Week (https://www.smw.sg/)\n. At Singapore International Water Week 2024, the World Bank Group and the Singapore government launched the\nSingapore Water Center (https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water/brief/SingaporeWaterCenter)\n. Located within the World Bank Group Singapore Office, the center leverages Singapore’s expertise in urban water management to foster innovation, knowledge exchange, and capacity development among policymakers, utility managers, and stakeholders in the water sector. It integrates advancements in policy, technology, and finance to tackle pressing water security challenges both regionally and globally. The Center offers training programs, joint studies, and pilot projects aimed at sustainable water solutions.\nThe World Bank Group, Infrastructure Asia, and Singapore Management University jointly developed a bespoke thematic course titled “Growing Infrastructure: Enabling & Structuring for Private Sector Participation in Finance and Innovation,” which builds leadership capabilities within the infrastructure sector across Southeast Asia and South Asia. Over 250 regional government officials have attended the training program since it began in 2020.\nLooking ahead, the Group Singapore Office will support the newly launched World Bank Group Academy, which aims to facilitate deeper engagement with clients through technical exchange, peer-to-peer learning, and the identification of good practices and proven solutions.\nLast updated: April 2025\nRELATED\nOpen Data (https://data.worldbank.org/)\nAROUND THE BANK GROUP\nFind out what the Bank Group's branches are doing in Singapore.\nIFC (https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/region__ext_content/regions/east+asia+and+the+pacific/countries/ifc+in+singapore)\nSTAY CONNECTED\nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/WorldBank)\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/WB_AsiaPacific)\nInstagram (https://instagram.com/worldbank)\nFlickr (https://www.flickr.com/WorldBank)\nYouTube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6706EF7A6A128C66)\nBlog (https://blogs.worldbank.org/search?keyword=&f%5B0%5D=countries%3A221)\nRSS (https://search.worldbank.org/api/v2/news?format=atom&countrycode_exact=SG)\nSign up for email updates (https://www.worldbank.org/en/newsletter-subscription?email=&subscribe=SUBMIT&lang=en)\nAdditional Resources\nRelated\nWorld Bank East Asia Pacific (https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eap)\nOffice of the Executive Director for Singapore (https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/leadership/directors/eds16)\nContacts\nWorld Bank Group Singapore Office\n10 Marina Boulevard,  Marina Bay Financial Center, Tower 2,  #12-01 Singapore 018983\n(65) 6517 1240\nworldbank_singapore@worldbank.org (mailto:worldbank_singapore@worldbank.org)\n[No Text] (https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home)\nIBRD (https://www.worldbank.org/en/who-we-are/ibrd)\nIDA (https://ida.worldbank.org/en/home)\nIFC (https://www.ifc.org/en/home)\nMIGA (https://www.miga.org/)\nICSID (https://icsid.worldbank.org/)\n[No Text] (https://www.facebook.com/worldbank)\n[No Text] (https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaeLyAgAojYvg7Wbr91k)\n[No Text] (https://x.com/worldbank)\n[No Text] (https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-world-bank/)\n[No Text] (https://www.instagram.com/worldbank/)\n[No Text] (https://www.youtube.com/user/WorldBank)\n[No Text] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/)\nWho We Are (https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/who-we-are)\nNews (https://www.worldbank.org/en/news)\nCareers (https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/careers)\nContact (https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/contacts)\nCountries (https://www.worldbank.org/en/where-we-work)\nTopics (https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic)\nProjects & Operations (https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/projects-home?lang=en)\nResearch &\n                  Publications (https://www.worldbank.org/en/research)\nEvents (https://www.worldbank.org/en/events/all)\nData (https://data.worldbank.org/)\nWBG Academy (https://academy.worldbank.org/en/home)\nResults\n                  Scorecard (https://scorecard.worldbank.org/en/scorecard/home)\nSTAY CURRENT\nWITH OUR LATEST DATA & INSIGHTS\nSign Up (https://www.worldbank.org/en/newsletter-subscription)\n© 2025 World Bank Group.
