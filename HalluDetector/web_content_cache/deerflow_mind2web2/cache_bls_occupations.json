The scope of practice varies from state to state.\n\n### Duties\n\nAdvanced practice registered nurses typically do the following:\n\n*   Take and record patients' medical histories and symptoms\n*   Perform physical exams and observe patients\n*   Create patient care plans or contribute to existing plans\n*   Perform and order diagnostic tests\n*   Operate and monitor medical equipment\n*   Diagnose various health problems\n*   Analyze test results or changes in a patient’s condition and alter treatment plans, as needed\n*   Give patients medicines and treatments\n*   Evaluate a patient’s response to medicines and treatments\n*   Consult with doctors and other healthcare professionals, as needed\n*   Counsel and teach patients and their families how to stay healthy or manage their illnesses or injuries\n*   Conduct research\n\nAPRNs work independently or in collaboration with [physicians](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physicians-and-surgeons.htm \"Physicians and Surgeons\"). In most states, they can prescribe medications, order medical tests, and diagnose health problems. APRNs may provide primary and preventive care and may specialize in care for certain groups of people, such as children, pregnant women, or patients with mental health disorders.\n\nAPRNs have some of the same duties as[registered nurses](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm \"Registered Nurses\"), including gathering information about a patient’s condition and taking action to treat or manage the patient’s health. However, APRNs are trained to do other tasks, including ordering and evaluating test results, referring patients to specialists, and diagnosing and treating ailments. APRNs focus on patient-centered care, which means understanding a patient’s concerns and lifestyle before choosing a course of action.\n\nSome APRNs also conduct research or teach staff about new policies or procedures. Others may provide consultation services based on a specific field of knowledge, such as oncology, which is the study of cancer.\n\nThe following are types of APRNs:\n\n**_Nurse anesthetists (CRNAs)_** administer anesthesia and provide care before, during, and after surgical, therapeutic, diagnostic, and obstetrical procedures. They also provide pain management and some emergency services. Before a procedure begins, nurse anesthetists discuss with a patient any medications the patient is taking as well as any allergies or illnesses the patient may have, so that anesthesia can be safely administered. Nurse anesthetists then give a patient general anesthesia to put the patient to sleep so they feel no pain during surgery or administer a regional or local anesthesia to numb an area of the body. During the procedure, they monitor the patient’s vital signs and adjust the anesthesia as necessary.\n\n**_Nurse midwives (CNMs)_** provide care to women, including gynecological exams, family planning services, and prenatal care. They deliver babies, manage emergency situations during labor, repair lacerations, and may provide surgical assistance to physicians during cesarean births. Nurse midwives may act as primary maternity care providers for women. They also provide wellness care, educating their patients on how to lead healthy lives by discussing topics such as nutrition and disease prevention. Nurse midwives also provide care to their patients’ partners for sexual or reproductive health issues.\n\n**_Nurse practitioners (NPs)_** serve as primary and specialty care providers, delivering advanced nursing services to patients and their families. They assess patients, determine how to improve or manage a patient’s health, and discuss ways to integrate health promotion strategies into a patient’s life. Nurse practitioners typically care for a certain population of people. For instance, NPs may work in adult and geriatric health, pediatric health, or psychiatric and mental health.\n\nAlthough the scope of their duties varies by state, many nurse practitioners work independently, prescribe medications, and order laboratory tests. Nurse practitioners consult with [physicians](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physicians-and-surgeons.htm \"Physicians and Surgeons\") and other health professionals when needed.\n\nSee the profile on [registered nurses](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm \"Registered Nurses\") for more information about **_clinical nurse specialists_ (CNSs**), also considered to be a type of APRN.\n\nWork Environment[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/nurse-anesthetists-nurse-midwives-and-nurse-practitioners.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-working-environment)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 2: nurse anesthetists nurse midwives and nurse practitioners image](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/images/15382.jpg)\n\nAPRNs work in a variety of healthcare settings, including hospitals.\n\nNurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners held about 349,600 jobs in 2023. Employment in the detailed occupations that make up nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners was distributed as follows:\n\nNurse practitioners 292,500\nNurse anesthetists 49,900\nNurse midwives 7,200\n\nThe largest employers of nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners were as follows:\n\nOffices of physicians 49%\nHospitals; state, local, and private 25\nOutpatient care centers 8\nOffices of other health practitioners 4\nEducational services; state, local, and private 3\n\nSome advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) provide care in patients’ homes. Some nurse midwives work in birthing centers, which are a type of outpatient care center.\n\nAPRNs may travel long distances to help care for patients in places where there are not enough healthcare workers.\n\n### Injuries and Illnesses\n\nAPRN work can be both physically and emotionally demanding. Some APRNs spend much of their day on their feet. They are vulnerable to back injuries because they must lift and move patients. APRN work can also be stressful because they make critical decisions that affect a patient’s health.\n\nBecause of the environments in which they work, APRNs may come in close contact with infectious diseases. Therefore, they must follow strict guidelines to guard against diseases and other dangers, such as accidental needle sticks or patient outbursts.\n\n### Work Schedules\n\nMost APRNs work full time. In physicians’ offices, APRNs typically work during normal business hours. In hospitals and other healthcare facilities, they may work in shifts—including nights, weekends, and holidays—to provide round-the-clock patient care. Some APRNs, especially those who work in critical care or those who deliver babies, also may need to be on call.\n\nHow to Become a Nurse Anesthetist, Nurse Midwife, or Nurse Practitioner[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/nurse-anesthetists-nurse-midwives-and-nurse-practitioners.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-become-one)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 3: nurse anesthetists nurse midwives and nurse practitioners image](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/images/15378.jpg)\n\nAPRNs must earn a master’s degree which typically includes clinical experience.\n\nNurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners, also referred to as _advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs)_, must have at least a master’s degree in their specialty role. APRNs also must be licensed registered nurses in their state, pass a national certification exam, and have a state APRN license.\n\n### Education\n\nNurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners typically need at least a master's [degree](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/home.htm) in an advanced practice nursing field. Accredited[healthcare and related](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/healthcare-and-related/healthcare-and-related-field-of-degree.htm)programs in these specialties typically include classroom education and clinical experience. Courses in subjects such as advanced health assessment, pathophysiology, and pharmacology are common as well as coursework specific to the chosen APRN role.\n\nAn APRN must have a registered nursing (RN) license before pursuing education in one of the advanced practice roles, and a strong background in science is helpful.\n\nMost APRN programs prefer candidates who have a bachelor’s degree in nursing. However, some schools offer bridge programs for [registered nurses](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm \"Registered Nurses\") with an associate’s degree or diploma in nursing. Graduate-level programs are also available for individuals who did not obtain a bachelor’s degree in nursing but in a related health science field. These programs prepare the student for the RN licensure exam in addition to offering the APRN curriculum.\n\nAlthough a master’s degree is the most common form of entry-level education, APRNs may choose to earn a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) or a Ph.D. The specific educational requirements and qualifications for each of the roles are available on professional organizations’ websites.\n\nProspective nurse anesthetists must have 1 year of experience working as registered nurse in a critical care setting as a prerequisite for admission to an accredited nurse anesthetist program.\n\n### Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nStates’ requirements for APRNs vary. In general, APRNs must have a registered nursing license, complete an accredited graduate-level program, pass a national certification exam, and have an APRN license. Details are available from each state’s board of nursing.\n\nTo become licensed and use an APRN title, most states require national certification.\n\nThe [National Board of Certification and Recertification for Nurse Anesthetists](http://www.nbcrna.com/Pages/default.aspx) (NBCRNA) offers the National Certification Examination (NCE). Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) must maintain their certification through the Continued Professional Certification (CPC) Program.\n\nThe [American Midwifery Certification Board](http://www.amcbmidwife.org/) offers the Certified Nurse-Midwife (CNM). Individuals with this designation must recertify via the Certificate Maintenance Program.\n\nThere are several different certifications for nurse practitioners, including those available from the [American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Board](https://www.aanpcert.org/index) (AANPCB), the [American Nurses Credentialing Center](https://www.nursingworld.org/ancc/) (ANCC), and the [Pediatric Nursing Certification Board](http://www.pncb.org/ptistore/control/index) (PNCB). Each of these certifications requires periodic renewal.\n\nIn addition, APRN positions may require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), basic life support (BLS), or advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) certification.\n\n### Important Qualities\n\n**_Communication skills._** Advanced practice registered nurses have to be able to communicate with patients and other healthcare professionals to ensure the appropriate course of action.\n\n**_Critical-thinking skills._** APRNs must be able to assess changes in a patient’s health, quickly determine the most appropriate course of action, and decide if a consultation with another healthcare professional is needed.\n\n**_Compassion._** APRNs should be caring and sympathetic when treating patients.\n\n**_Detail oriented._** APRNs need to be thorough in providing treatments and medications that affect their patients’ health. During an evaluation, they must notice even small changes in a patient’s condition.\n\n**_Interpersonal skills._** APRNs must work with patients and families as well as with other healthcare providers and staff. They work as part of a team to determine and execute healthcare options for the patients they treat.\n\n**_Leadership skills._** APRNs often work in positions of seniority. They must effectively direct and sometimes manage other nurses on staff when providing patient care.\n\n**_Resourcefulness._** APRNs should know where to find the answers that they need.\n\n### Advancement\n\nSome APRNs take on managerial or administrative roles; others go into academia. APRNs who earn a doctoral degree may conduct independent research or work on an interprofessional research team.\n\nPay[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/nurse-anesthetists-nurse-midwives-and-nurse-practitioners.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-pay)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Nurse Anesthetists, Nurse Midwives, and Nurse Practitioners\n\nMedian annual wages, May 2024\n\n Nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners \n\n$132,050\n\n Healthcare diagnosing or treating practitioners \n\n$101,370\n\n Total, all occupations \n\n$49,500\n\nThe median annual wage for nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners was $132,050 in May 2024. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $98,520, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $217,270.\n\nMedian annual wages for nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners in May 2024 were as follows:\n\nNurse anesthetists$223,210\nNurse practitioners 129,210\nNurse midwives 128,790\n\nIn May 2024, the median annual wages for nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners in the top industries in which they worked were as follows:\n\nHospitals; state, local, and private$137,790\nOutpatient care centers 137,640\nEducational services; state, local, and private 132,070\nOffices of physicians 129,820\nOffices of other health practitioners 117,780\n\nMost advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) work full time.

Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\n### Employment\n\nProjected employment of nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners varies by occupation (see table). Growth will occur because of an increase in the demand for healthcare services. Several factors will contribute to this demand, including an increased emphasis on preventive care and demand for healthcare services from the aging population.\n\nAdvanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) perform many of the same services as [physicians](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physicians-and-surgeons.htm \"Physicians and Surgeons\"). APRNs will be increasingly used in team-based models of care, particularly in hospitals, offices of physicians, clinics, and other ambulatory care settings, where they will be needed to provide preventive and primary care.\n\nAPRNs will also be needed to care for the large baby-boom population. As baby boomers age, they will experience ailments and complex conditions that require medical care. APRNs will be needed to keep these patients healthy and to treat the growing number of patients with chronic and acute conditions.\n\nAs states change their laws governing APRN practice authority, APRNs are being allowed to perform more services. APRNs also are being recognized more widely by the public as a source for primary healthcare.\n\n Employment projections data for nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners, 2023–33| Occupational Title | SOC Code | Employment, 2023 | Projected Employment, 2033 | Change, 2023–33 | Employment by Industry |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Percent | Numeric |\n| SOURCE: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment Projections program |\n| **Nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners** | — | 349,600 | 490,700 | 40 | 141,200 | — |\n| **Nurse anesthetists** | 29-1151 | 49,900 | 55,100 | 10 | 5,200 | [Get data](https://data.bls.gov/projections/nationalMatrix?queryParams=29-1151&ioType=o) |\n| **Nurse midwives** | 29-1161 | 7,200 | 7,700 | 7 | 500 | [Get data](https://data.bls.gov/projections/nationalMatrix?queryParams=29-1161&ioType=o) |\n| **Nurse practitioners** | 29-1171 | 292,500 | 427,900 | 46 | 135,500 | [Get data](https://data.bls.gov/projections/nationalMatrix?queryParams=29-1171&ioType=o) |\n\nState & Area Data[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/nurse-anesthetists-nurse-midwives-and-nurse-practitioners.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-state-area)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)**\n\nThe [Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/) (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations.

The amount of collaboration and the extent to which they must be supervised by physicians or surgeons differ by state.\n\nPhysician assistants work in a variety of healthcare specialties, including primary care and family medicine, emergency medicine, and psychiatry. The work of physician assistants depends, in large part, on their specialty or the type of medical practice in which they work. For example, a physician assistant working in surgery may close incisions and provide care before, during, and after an operation. A physician assistant working in pediatrics may examine a child and give routine vaccinations.\n\nIn some areas, especially rural and medically underserved communities, physician assistants may be the primary care providers at clinics where a physician is present only 1 or 2 days per week. In these locations, physician assistants collaborate with the physician as needed and as required by law.\n\nSome physician assistants make house calls or visit nursing homes to treat patients.\n\nPhysician assistants differ from [nurse practitioners](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/nurse-anesthetists-nurse-midwives-and-nurse-practitioners.htm) in their training and the level of care they provide; for example, nurse practitioners cannot provide surgical care, whereas physician assistants can. They also differ from [medical assistants](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/medical-assistants.htm \"Medical Assistants\"), who do routine clinical and clerical tasks but do not practice medicine.\n\nWork Environment[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physician-assistants.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-working-environment)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 2: Physician assistants](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/images/2412.jpg)\n\nMany physician assistants work in primary care specialties, such as general internal medicine, pediatrics, and family medicine.\n\nPhysician assistants held about 153,400 jobs in 2023. The largest employers of physician assistants were as follows:\n\nOffices of physicians 54%\nHospitals; state, local, and private 25\nOutpatient care centers 9\nEducational services; state, local, and private 3\nGovernment 1\n\nWorking with patients can be both physically and emotionally demanding. Physician assistants spend much of their time standing or walking to make rounds and evaluate patients. Physician assistants who work in operating rooms often stand for extended periods.\n\n### Work Schedules\n\nMost physician assistants work full time.Work schedules vary and may include nights, weekends, or holidays. Physician assistants also may be on call, meaning that they must be ready to respond to a work request with little notice.\n\nHow to Become a Physician Assistant[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physician-assistants.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-become-one)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 3: Physician assistants](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/images/2414.jpg)\n\nPhysician assistants must be able to communicate medical issues in a way that patients understand.\n\nPhysician assistants typically need a master’s degree from an accredited educational program. Applicants to these programs typically have a bachelor's degree and experience caring directly for patients. All states require physician assistants to be licensed.\n\n### Education\n\nApplicants to physician assistant education programs typically have a bachelor’s [degree](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/home.htm) and some experience with patient care. Although programs vary, most require applicants to have taken undergraduate coursework with a focus in science. Bachelor's degrees are often in [healthcare](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/healthcare-and-related/healthcare-and-related-field-of-degree.htm) or a related field, such as [biology](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/biology/biology-field-of-degree.htm). Programs also may require that applicants have experience as a [medical assistant](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/medical-assistants.htm), [EMT or paramedic](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/emts-and-paramedics.htm), or another occupation that involves patient care.\n\nPhysician assistant education programs usually take at least 2 years of postbaccalaureate study. A list of accredited physician assistant programs is available from the [Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc.](http://www.arc-pa.org/) (ARC-PA).\n\nPhysician assistant education includes classroom and laboratory instruction in subjects such as human anatomy, clinical medicine, and pharmacology. The programs also include supervised clinical training in several specialties, such as family medicine, internal medicine, and emergency medicine.\n\n### Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nAll states and the District of Columbia require physician assistants to be licensed. To become licensed, candidates must pass the Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination (PANCE)administered by the [National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants](https://www.nccpa.net/) (NCCPA). A physician assistant who passes the exam may use the credential “Physician Assistant-Certified (PA-C).”\n\nTo maintain their PA-C certification, physician assistants must complete continuing education and pass a recertification exam within a specified number of years.\n\nIn most states,laws require physician assistants to hold an agreement with a supervising physician. Although the physician does not need to be onsite at all times, collaboration between physicians and physician assistants is required for practice.\n\nPhysician assistant positions may require basic life support (BLS) certification.\n\n### Advancement\n\nSome physician assistants pursue additional education in a specialty. Postgraduate programs are available in specialties such as emergency medicine and psychiatry. To enter one of these programs, a physician assistant must be a graduate of an accredited program and have their PA-C. Additional certification in specialty areas is offered by the NCCPA.\n\n### Important Qualities\n\n**_Communication skills._** Physician assistants must explain complex medical issues in a way that patients can understand.\n\n**_Compassion._** Physician assistants deal with patients who are sick or injured and who may be in extreme pain or distress. They must be sympathetic toward and understanding of patients and their families.\n\n**_Detail oriented._** Physician assistants should be observant and have a strong ability to focus when evaluating and treating patients.\n\n**_Emotional stability._** Physician assistants, particularly those working in surgery or emergency medicine, should work well under pressure. They must remain calm in stressful situations in order to provide quality care.\n\n**_Interpersonal skills_**. Physician assistants must work well as part of a team of other healthcare professionals to ensure proper patient care.\n\n**_Problem-solving skills._** Physician assistants need to evaluate patients’ symptoms and administer the appropriate treatments. They must be diligent when investigating complicated medical issues so they can determine the best course of treatment for each patient.\n\nPay[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physician-assistants.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-pay)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Physician Assistants\n\nMedian annual wages, May 2024\n\n Physician assistants \n\n$133,260\n\n Healthcare diagnosing or treating practitioners \n\n$101,370\n\n Total, all occupations \n\n$49,500\n\nThe median annual wage for physician assistants was $133,260 in May 2024. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $95,240, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $182,200.\n\nIn May 2024, the median annual wages for physician assistants in the top industries in which they worked were as follows:\n\nGovernment$151,470\nOutpatient care centers 147,650\nHospitals; state, local, and private 136,630\nOffices of physicians 129,640\nEducational services; state, local, and private 127,900\n\nMost physician assistants work full time.Work schedules vary and may include nights, weekends, or holidays.

Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\n### Employment\n\nThe growing population will continue to increase demand for healthcare services. A rise in the number of older people, who are more likely than young people to require medical care, and of patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, will also increase healthcare demand. These increases, in turn, drive the need for healthcare providers such as physician assistants (PAs), who often provide preventive care and treat the sick.\n\nPAs, who can provide many of the same services as [physicians](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physicians-and-surgeons.htm), are expected to continue to expand their role in providing healthcare services. This is largely because they can be trained more quickly than physicians, and team-based healthcare provision models will continue to evolve and become more common.\n\n Employment projections data for physician assistants, 2023–33| Occupational Title | SOC Code | Employment, 2023 | Projected Employment, 2033 | Change, 2023–33 | Employment by Industry |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Percent | Numeric |\n| SOURCE: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment Projections program |\n| **Physician assistants** | 29-1071 | 153,400 | 197,100 | 28 | 43,700 | [Get data](https://data.bls.gov/projections/nationalMatrix?queryParams=29-1071&ioType=o) |\n\nState & Area Data[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physician-assistants.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-state-area)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)**\n\nThe [Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/) (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations.

Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\n### [State & Area Data](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm#tab-7)\n\nExplore resources for employment and wages by state and area for actuaries.\n\n### [Similar Occupations](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm#tab-8)\n\nCompare the job duties, education, job growth, and pay of actuaries with similar occupations.\n\n### [More Information, Including Links to O*NET](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm#tab-9)\n\nLearn more about actuaries by visiting additional resources, including O*NET, a source on key characteristics of workers and occupations.\n\nWhat Actuaries Do[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-what-they-do)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 1: Actuaries](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/images/1827.jpg)\n\nActuaries produce charts, tables, and reports to explain their calculations.\n\nActuaries analyze the financial costs of risk and uncertainty. They use mathematics, statistics, and financial theory to assess the risk of potential events, and they help businesses and clients develop policies that minimize the cost of that risk. Actuaries’ work is essential to the insurance industry.\n\n### Duties\n\nActuaries typically do the following:\n\n*   Compile and analyze statistical data and other information\n*   Estimate the probability and likely economic cost of an event such as death, sickness, an accident, or a natural disaster\n*   Design and test insurance policies, investments,and other business strategies to minimize risk and maximize profitability\n*   Calculate cash reserves needed, based on existing policies and liabilities, in case of payout or claims\n*   Produce charts, tables, and reports that explain calculations and proposals\n*   Explain their findings and proposals to company executives, government officials, shareholders, and clients\n\nActuaries use database software to compile information. They use statistical and modeling software to forecast the probability of an event occurring, the potential costs of the event if it does occur, and whether the insurance company has enough money to pay future claims.\n\nActuaries typically work on teams that often include managers and workers from other fields, such as accounting, underwriting, and finance. For example, some actuaries work with [accountants](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/accountants-and-auditors.htm \"Accountants and Auditors\") and [financial analysts](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/financial-analysts.htm \"Financial Analysts\") to set the price for security offerings or with [data scientists](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm) to forecast demand for new products.\n\nMost actuaries work for insurance companies, where they help design policies and determine the premiums that should be charged for each policy. They must ensure that the premiums are profitable yet competitive with other insurance companies.\n\nSome actuaries work as consultants and provide advice to clients on a contract basis. Many consulting actuaries audit the work of internal actuaries at insurance companies or handle actuarial duties for insurance companies that are not large enough to keep their own actuaries on staff.\n\nActuaries in the insurance industry typically specialize in one field of insurance, such as the following:\n\n**_Health insurance actuaries_** help develop long-term care and health insurance policies by predicting expected costs of providing care under the terms of an insurance contract. Their predictions are based on numerous factors, including family history, geographic location, and occupation.\n\n**_Life insurance actuaries_** help develop annuity and life insurance policies for individuals and groups by creating estimates of how long someone will live. These estimates are based on risk factors, such as age and tobacco use.\n\n**_Property and casualty insurance actuaries_** help develop policies that insure policyholders against property loss and liability resulting from accidents, natural disasters, fires, and other events. For example, they calculate the expected number of claims resulting from automobile accidents, which varies with the insured person’s age, driving history, type of car, and other factors.\n\nSome actuaries apply their expertise to financial matters outside of the insurance industry. For example, they develop investment strategies that manage risks and maximize returns for companies or individuals. Actuaries outside of the insurance industry include the following:\n\n**_Enterprise risk_ _management_ _actuaries_** identify risks, including economic, financial, and geopolitical risks that may affect a company’s short-term or long-term objectives. They help [top executives](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/management/top-executives.htm) determine how much risk the business is willing to take, and they develop strategies to mitigate the financial impact of those risks.\n\n**_Pension and retirement benefits actuaries_** design, test, and evaluate company pension plans to determine if funds available in the future will be enough to ensure payment of benefits. They must report the results of their evaluations to the federal government. Pension actuaries also help businesses develop other types of retirement benefits, such as 401(k)s and healthcare plans for retirees. In addition, they provide retirement planning advice to individuals.\n\n**_Public sector actuaries_** have different duties, based on the level of government in which they work. In the federal government, actuaries may evaluate proposed changes to Social Security or Medicare or conduct economic and demographic studies to project benefit obligations. At the state level, actuaries may examine and regulate the rates charged by insurance companies.\n\nWork Environment[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-working-environment)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 2: Actuaries](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/images/1829.jpg)\n\nActuaries typically work on teams that often include managers and professionals in other fields, such as accounting, underwriting, and finance.\n\nActuaries held about 30,200 jobs in 2023. The largest employers of actuaries were as follows:\n\nFinance and insurance 78%\nProfessional, scientific, and technical services 13\nManagement of companies and enterprises 3\nGovernment 3\n\nActuaries typically work on teams that often include managers and professionals in other fields, such as accounting, underwriting, and finance.\n\nAlthough actuaries usually work in an office setting, those who work for consulting firms may need to travel to meet with clients.\n\n### Work Schedules\n\nMost actuaries work full time, and some work more than 40 hours per week.\n\nHow to Become an Actuary[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-become-one)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 3: Actuaries](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/images/3641.jpg)\n\nActuaries need a bachelor’s degree and must pass a series of exams to become certified professionals.\n\nTo enter the occupation, actuaries typically need a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, actuarial science, statistics, or some other analytical field. Students must complete coursework in subjects such as economics, applied statistics, and corporate finance and must pass a series of exams to become certified.\n\n### Education\n\nActuaries need a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and business. Typically, actuaries have an undergraduate [degree](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/home.htm) in [mathematics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/mathematics/mathematics-field-of-degree.htm), [business](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/business/business-field-of-degree.htm), actuarial science, or some other analytical field.\n\nTo become certified, students must complete coursework in subjects such as economics, statistics, and corporate finance. Coursework in computer science, especially programming languages, and the ability to use and develop spreadsheets, databases, and statistical analysis tools also is important.\n\nBecause the different types of practice areas include health, life, pension, and casualty, internships may be helpful for students deciding on which actuarial track to pursue.\n\n### Licenses, Certification, and Registrations\n\nTwo professional organizations—the [Casualty Actuarial Society](http://www.casact.org/) (CAS) and the [Society of Actuaries](https://www.soa.org/member/) (SOA)—offer two levels of certification: associate and fellow.\n\nThe CAS certifies actuaries who work in the property and casualty field, which includes automobile, homeowners, commercial, and workers’ compensation insurance.\n\nThe SOA certifies actuaries who work in life insurance, health insurance, retirement benefits, investments, and finance.\n\nBoth credentials require candidates to complete coursework in economics, finance, and mathematical statistics while in college. Candidates also must pass a series of exams and take seminars on professionalism.\n\nMany employers expect prospective hires to have passed at least one or two of these certification exams before graduation.\n\nIt may take up to 7 years for an actuary to earn the associate-level certification because of the lengthy preparation required. After becoming associates, actuaries typically take several more years to earn fellowship status. Both the CAS and the SOA have a continuing education requirement.\n\nThe SOA offers fellowship certification in five separate tracks: life and annuities, group and health benefits, retirement benefits, quantitative finance and investments, and corporate finance/enterprise risk management. Unlike the SOA, the CAS does not offer specialized study tracks for fellowship certification.\n\nPension actuaries typically must be licensed by the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of the Treasury’s [Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries](http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Enrolled-Actuaries).Licensed pension actuaries, known as enrolled actuaries, must meet certain experience requirements and pass exams administered through the SOA.\n\n### Training\n\nEntry-level actuaries typically start out as trainees. They are usually on teams with experienced actuaries who serve as mentors. Trainees begin work on basic tasks, such as compiling data, and take on more complex duties, such as conducting research and writing reports, as they gain experience. Trainees also may work in other departments, such as marketing, underwriting, and product development, to learn how actuaries fit into all aspects of a company.\n\nMost employers support their actuaries throughout the certification process. For example, employers may pay the cost of exams and study materials or provide paid time to study. Employees may receive raises or bonuses for each exam that they pass.\n\n### Advancement\n\nAdvancement usually depends on job performance and the number of actuarial exams passed. For example, actuaries who achieve fellowship status often supervise the work of other actuaries and provide input to senior management. Actuaries with a broad knowledge of risk management and how it applies to business may advance to become top executives, such as chief risk officers or chief financial officers.\n\n### Important Qualities\n\n**_Analytical skills._** Actuaries identify patterns and trends in complex sets of data to determine the factors that affect certain types of events.\n\n**_Communication skills._** Actuaries must be able to explain complex technical matters to those without an actuarial background. They also must describe their work and recommendations clearly in written reports and memos.\n\n**_Computer skills._** Actuaries must know programming languages and be able to use and develop spreadsheets, databases, and statistical analysis tools.\n\n**_Interpersonal skills._** Actuaries serve as leaders and members of teams, so they must be able to listen to and collaborate with others.\n\n**_Math skills._** Actuaries quantify risk by using the principles of calculus, statistics, and probability.\n\n**_Problem-solving skills._** Actuaries identify risks and develop ways for businesses to manage those risks.\n\nPay[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-pay)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Actuaries\n\nMedian annual wages, May 2024\n\n Actuaries \n\n$125,770\n\n Mathematical science occupations \n\n$104,620\n\n Total, all occupations \n\n$49,500\n\nThe median annual wage for actuaries was $125,770 in May 2024.

These actuaries help companies adjust their business or investment strategies across all areas of operation.\n\nInsurance companies will need actuaries to analyze the large amount of information, such as medical or property data, collected from consumers. These data will allow insurance companies to develop new products, set competitive prices, predict consumer behavior, and improve projections of future risks and costs.\n\nIn addition, health insurance companies will require actuaries to help evaluate the effects of changing healthcare regulations and guidelines, expand into new insurance markets, and offer products to new customers.\n\n Employment projections data for actuaries, 2023–33| Occupational Title | SOC Code | Employment, 2023 | Projected Employment, 2033 | Change, 2023–33 | Employment by Industry |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Percent | Numeric |\n| SOURCE: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment Projections program |\n| **Actuaries** | 15-2011 | 30,200 | 36,800 | 22 | 6,600 | [Get data](https://data.bls.gov/projections/nationalMatrix?queryParams=15-2011&ioType=o) |\n\nState & Area Data[About this section](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-state-area)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)**\n\nThe [Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/) (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations.
