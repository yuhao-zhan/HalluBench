presents us two things:\n1) A nice movie, well illustrated by good (and partly excellent) actors. There are action, suspense, romance and impressing animations. - All what a traditional movie defines. It's well chosen there's not a lot of humor, because it would not match to the complete Star Wars Story. There are two scenes which touched my soul. First: The dying of the mother. To rescue his mother, Anakin risked the safety of Amidala and became unfaithful in his mission. In the moment he found her, Shmi dies. Second: PadmÃ© confesses her love to Anakin at the sight of death. It's one of the points which define our human nature, to desire what we may not have. Such touching scenes make a movie become alive. I remember the scene in Episode one, when young Ani leaves his mother to start an unknown way of destination. Two years after the movie I still have tears in my eyes watching this scene on DVD. Episode 1 to 3 is needed to guide us to Episode 4 to 6, which already exist, paradoxically. But that's the way it makes it interesting: A lot of stories result in one single story. That's alike Quentin's Best, Pulp Fiction - one of my favorite stripe (apart from Star Wars and some others). Out of my view, there's only one bad, really bad scene in Attack of the Clones: The fighting between Yoda and Dooku. Yoda's action appears absolutely trashy. I guess George wants to stress the power of Dooku. But that's not necessary, after all Obi-Wan and Anakin have been beaten. Except on this, George and his team made a very good job to offer us a very good living movie. But furthermore, they present us not only a nice movie, but also...\n2) An invitation for philosophical thoughts. Episode 2 answers the question of Good and Evil. Due to this movie, we are not good or bad by nature. It's our action which defines our personality. Anakin is a mirror of the human culture in real life. Formerly (in Episode 1) he was a lovely boy. He was ready to help everybody without a thought of reward. In Episode 2 the audience becomes witness of his changing to a self-centred and power-hungry character, because the power he's already having poisoned him. This could happen to all of us! In my view it's not a question of destination. Although Anakin was meant to be the one which will balance the power before he was born. He knows about this prophecy and decides to go this way anyway. I conclude from this, we all have a destination but it's our decision to follow it or not. That's another point which defines our human nature: The free will. Furthermore, there's a second message in this movie: We cannot fight against war by celebrating war. It's typical that the clone army first represents the protection for the sincere republic and in Episode 4 (maybe in Episode 3 already) it changes to the evil army fighting against the sincere system. I'm not a member of an organization like Green Peace. I just use the following example to stress the parallel of this message in the movie to our real life: The nuclear weapons, once released to destroy an enemy, will also destroy the sender, because the enemy will strike back with exactly the same weapons.\nEpisode 2 invites us to become like Amidala. She's strong and follows pure sincere principles. She's ready to sacrifice her life for letting remain the glory of the good.

(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249221/?ref_=rwurv_ov_i)\nReview by Gordon-11\nZulu\nVery violent\nThis film tells the story of two policemen who hunt down drug lords in South Africa, paying a high price for something they belief in along the way.\nSet in a country scared by inhuman policies, the film is unnecessarily but understandably very violent. Quite a few scenes are shocking to watch, and I find myself closing my eyes on a few occasions. The plot itself is not particularly engaging or thrilling. It offers some cat and mouse chases and one upmanship, but it just doesn't make me care about the characters. The final scene in the desert is almost baffling, as all of a sudden they are in a desert, walking for minutes. It drags on a bit, when the film could have finished there and then. Overall, I have not enjoyed it as much as I expected.\nHelpful\nâ¢\n2\n7\nGordon-11 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0035842/?ref_=rwurv_usr_t)\nMay 23, 2014\nMore from this title\nMore to explore\nList (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=rwurv_sw_staffpicks_em00081_i)\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in August (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=rwurv_sw_staffpicks_em00081_t)\nSee our picks (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=rwurv_c_sw_staffpicks_em00081_cta)\nList (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=rwurv_pks_augl25tv_i)\nAugust 2025 TV and Streaming Premiere Dates (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=rwurv_pks_augl25tv_t)\nSee the list (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=rwurv_c_pks_augl25tv_cta)\nUser lists (https://www.imdb.com/lists/tt2249221/?ref_=rwurv_urls_sm)\nRelated lists from IMDb users\nCreate a list (https://www.imdb.com/list/create/?ref_=rwurv_urls)\nUpcoming 2013created 13 years agoâ¢22 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls004912588/?ref_=rwurv_urls_1)\n7.5created 2 years agoâ¢41 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls569378735/?ref_=rwurv_urls_2)\n2013created 11 years agoâ¢50 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls052225143/?ref_=rwurv_urls_3)\nList for Scottcreated 11 years agoâ¢34 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls058431342/?ref_=rwurv_urls_4)\nOrlando Bloomcreated 4 years agoâ¢38 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls083488443/?ref_=rwurv_urls_5)\nBased on Bookscreated 3 months agoâ¢41 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls592046057/?ref_=rwurv_urls_6)\nUser polls (https://www.imdb.com/poll/?ref_=rwurv_urpl_sm)\nRelated polls from IMDb users\nCelebrating Movember (https://www.imdb.com/poll/aQHwnzxc7A0/?ref_=rwurv_urpl_1)\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=rwurv_csegsdcc_pwl25_i)\nPhotos We Love: San Diego Comic-Con 2025 (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=rwurv_csegsdcc_pwl25_t)\nSee the full gallery (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=rwurv_c_csegsdcc_pwl25_cta)\nRecently viewed\nClear all\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249221/?ref_=rwurv_rvi_i_1)\nZulu (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249221/?ref_=rwurv_rvi_t_1)\nGet the IMDb App (https://slyb.app.link/SKdyQ6A449)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt2249221%2Freview%2Frw3020881%2F&ref_=rwurv_ftr_reg)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt2249221%2Freview%2Frw3020881%2F&ref_=rwurv_ftr_reg)\nFollow IMDb on social\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nGet the IMDb App\nFor Android and iOS\n[No Text] (https://slyb.app.link/Aa96cLcBeAb)\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nHelp (https://help.imdb.com/imdb)\nSite Index (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/general-information/imdb-site-index/GNCX7BHNSPBTFALQ#so)\nIMDbPro (https://pro.imdb.com?ref_=cons_tf_pro&rf=cons_tf_pro)\nBox Office Mojo (https://www.boxofficemojo.com)\nLicense IMDb Data (https://developer.imdb.com/)\nPress Room (https://www.imdb.com/pressroom/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nAdvertising (https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/imdb/)\nJobs (https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/imdb)\nConditions of Use (https://www.imdb.com/conditions/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nPrivacy Policy (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nYour Ads Privacy Choices (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nIMDb, an Amazon company\nÂ© 1990-\n2025\nby IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

But I draw the line at this.\nBy rights, films this bad should be hilarious. Yet this is anything\nbut. Why? Partly because it is SUPPOSED to be a comedy (did they decide\nthat before or after production - difficult to tell). But mostly\nbecause there is no conviction. The over-riding production value is to\ngo through the motions and get the thing over with. Hence the appalling\nscore is unhingingly irritating and the \"action\" is so badly put\ntogether with freeze frames and plot jumps that I assumed my DVD player\nwas playing up and I took the disk out to clean it. Sadly it didn't\nhelp. An electric sander might have improved matters by making the\nthing impossible to play. This film is drivel. Avoid.\nHelpful\nâ¢\n3\n2\njulianfsmith (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur55970009/?ref_=rwurv_usr_t)\nOct 21, 2014\nMore from this title\nMore to explore\nList (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=rwurv_sw_staffpicks_em00081_i)\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in August (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=rwurv_sw_staffpicks_em00081_t)\nSee our picks (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=rwurv_c_sw_staffpicks_em00081_cta)\nList (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=rwurv_pks_augl25tv_i)\nAugust 2025 TV and Streaming Premiere Dates (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=rwurv_pks_augl25tv_t)\nSee the list (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=rwurv_c_pks_augl25tv_cta)\nUser lists (https://www.imdb.com/lists/tt0068246/?ref_=rwurv_urls_sm)\nRelated lists from IMDb users\nCreate a list (https://www.imdb.com/list/create/?ref_=rwurv_urls)\n01-La Familiacreated 5 years agoâ¢40 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls091308364/?ref_=rwurv_urls_1)\nWestern Moviescreated 5 years agoâ¢29 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls093091110/?ref_=rwurv_urls_2)\nGina Lollobrigida Favorite Performancecreated 2 years agoâ¢25 images (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls562275834/?ref_=rwurv_urls_3)\nWiLD WiLD WiLD WesTcreated 9 years agoâ¢40 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls063688723/?ref_=rwurv_urls_4)\nSpaghetti Westernscreated 3 years agoâ¢26 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls501851311/?ref_=rwurv_urls_5)\nSpagetti westerncreated 3 years agoâ¢39 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls571005519/?ref_=rwurv_urls_6)\nUser polls (https://www.imdb.com/poll/?ref_=rwurv_urpl_sm)\nRelated polls from IMDb users\nGina Lollobrigida Favorite Performance (https://www.imdb.com/poll/qV0yog1dCpQ/?ref_=rwurv_urpl_1)\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=rwurv_csegsdcc_pwl25_i)\nPhotos We Love: San Diego Comic-Con 2025 (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=rwurv_csegsdcc_pwl25_t)\nSee the full gallery (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=rwurv_c_csegsdcc_pwl25_cta)\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\nGet the IMDb App (https://slyb.app.link/SKdyQ6A449)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt0068246%2Freview%2Frw3108927%2F&ref_=rwurv_ftr_reg)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt0068246%2Freview%2Frw3108927%2F&ref_=rwurv_ftr_reg)\nFollow IMDb on social\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nGet the IMDb App\nFor Android and iOS\n[No Text] (https://slyb.app.link/Aa96cLcBeAb)\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nHelp (https://help.imdb.com/imdb)\nSite Index (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/general-information/imdb-site-index/GNCX7BHNSPBTFALQ#so)\nIMDbPro (https://pro.imdb.com?ref_=cons_tf_pro&rf=cons_tf_pro)\nBox Office Mojo (https://www.boxofficemojo.com)\nLicense IMDb Data (https://developer.imdb.com/)\nPress Room (https://www.imdb.com/pressroom/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nAdvertising (https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/imdb/)\nJobs (https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/imdb)\nConditions of Use (https://www.imdb.com/conditions/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nPrivacy Policy (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nYour Ads Privacy Choices (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nIMDb, an Amazon company\nÂ© 1990-\n2025\nby IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

three parts (I, II, and III) of Masters of Modern Sculpture should be viewed one after the other. What an insightful introduction to the history of twentieth-century sculpture! I am impressed. I learned so much from this triptych, which I regard as a work of documentary film art in itself. The narration is a beautiful tapestry woven so as to connect the various movements and artists to one another in enlightening ways. Highly recommended to anyone interested in sculpture. I hardly ever give a 10 rating, but this documentary series deserves it.\nHelpful\nâ¢\n0\n0\nskepticskeptical (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22563365/?ref_=rwurv_usr_t)\nJun 25, 2019\nMore from this title\nMore to explore\nList (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=rwurv_sw_staffpicks_em00081_i)\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in August (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=rwurv_sw_staffpicks_em00081_t)\nSee our picks (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=rwurv_c_sw_staffpicks_em00081_cta)\nList (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=rwurv_pks_augl25tv_i)\nAugust 2025 TV and Streaming Premiere Dates (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=rwurv_pks_augl25tv_t)\nSee the list (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=rwurv_c_pks_augl25tv_cta)\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=rwurv_csegsdcc_pwl25_i)\nPhotos We Love: San Diego Comic-Con 2025 (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=rwurv_csegsdcc_pwl25_t)\nSee the full gallery (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=rwurv_c_csegsdcc_pwl25_cta)\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\nGet the IMDb App (https://slyb.app.link/SKdyQ6A449)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt1847641%2Freview%2Frw4957563%2F&ref_=rwurv_ftr_reg)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt1847641%2Freview%2Frw4957563%2F&ref_=rwurv_ftr_reg)\nFollow IMDb on social\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nGet the IMDb App\nFor Android and iOS\n[No Text] (https://slyb.app.link/Aa96cLcBeAb)\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nHelp (https://help.imdb.com/imdb)\nSite Index (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/general-information/imdb-site-index/GNCX7BHNSPBTFALQ#so)\nIMDbPro (https://pro.imdb.com?ref_=cons_tf_pro&rf=cons_tf_pro)\nBox Office Mojo (https://www.boxofficemojo.com)\nLicense IMDb Data (https://developer.imdb.com/)\nPress Room (https://www.imdb.com/pressroom/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nAdvertising (https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/imdb/)\nJobs (https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/imdb)\nConditions of Use (https://www.imdb.com/conditions/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nPrivacy Policy (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nYour Ads Privacy Choices (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nIMDb, an Amazon company\nÂ© 1990-\n2025\nby IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

Dowlin and Lon Chancy. The girl stenographer consents to live with her employer because of her sick sister. The sister dies and the girl leaves him. Later she marries a young minister. The scene at the moving picture show, where the committee passes upon a similar situation, was to the point and interesting. The minister forgives his wife after her confession, remembering the biblical admonition, \"Judge not that ye be not judged.\" This is very well done for this type of offering. The photography is very good and the cast handles the story well. - The Moving Picture World, January 9, 1915\nHelpful\nâ¢\n0\n0\ndeickemeyer (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0529525/?ref_=rwurv_usr_t)\nJul 4, 2019\nMore from this title\nMore to explore\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg1788844800/mediaviewer/rm2726377729/?ref_=rwurv_sw_g_cs_i)\nChild Stars, Then and Now (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg1788844800/mediaviewer/rm2726377729/?ref_=rwurv_sw_g_cs_t)\nSee the gallery (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg1788844800/mediaviewer/rm2726377729/?ref_=rwurv_c_sw_g_cs_cta)\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg3677002496/mediaviewer/rm569618434/?ref_=rwurv_sw_g_ts_i)\nThese Stars Are on the Rise (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg3677002496/mediaviewer/rm569618434/?ref_=rwurv_sw_g_ts_t)\nSee the gallery (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg3677002496/mediaviewer/rm569618434/?ref_=rwurv_c_sw_g_ts_cta)\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-cosplay/rg499947520/mediaviewer/rm3297358338/?ref_=rwurv_csegsdcc_cosplay25_i)\nCosplay at San Diego Comic-Con 2025 (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-cosplay/rg499947520/mediaviewer/rm3297358338/?ref_=rwurv_csegsdcc_cosplay25_t)\nSee the incredible looks (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-cosplay/rg499947520/mediaviewer/rm3297358338/?ref_=rwurv_c_csegsdcc_cosplay25_cta)\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\nGet the IMDb App (https://slyb.app.link/SKdyQ6A449)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt0006050%2Freview%2Frw4977205%2F&ref_=rwurv_ftr_reg)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt0006050%2Freview%2Frw4977205%2F&ref_=rwurv_ftr_reg)\nFollow IMDb on social\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nGet the IMDb App\nFor Android and iOS\n[No Text] (https://slyb.app.link/Aa96cLcBeAb)\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nHelp (https://help.imdb.com/imdb)\nSite Index (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/general-information/imdb-site-index/GNCX7BHNSPBTFALQ#so)\nIMDbPro (https://pro.imdb.com?ref_=cons_tf_pro&rf=cons_tf_pro)\nBox Office Mojo (https://www.boxofficemojo.com)\nLicense IMDb Data (https://developer.imdb.com/)\nPress Room (https://www.imdb.com/pressroom/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nAdvertising (https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/imdb/)\nJobs (https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/imdb)\nConditions of Use (https://www.imdb.com/conditions/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nPrivacy Policy (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nYour Ads Privacy Choices (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=rwurv_ftr)\nIMDb, an Amazon company\nÂ© 1990-\n2025\nby IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

Tom Hanks and Tim Allen's performances elevate Woody and Buzz Lightyear, blending humor with emotional depth. Randy Newman's soundtrack, especially \"You've Got a Friend in Me,\" enhances the film's emotional resonance. Its innovative technology and storytelling have made it a cultural milestone and timeless classic in animation history.\nAI-generated from the text of user reviews\nAnimation style\nAuthentic emotion\nCharacter development\nComedic brilliance\nEmotional weight\nEscapism\nFriendship\nGenerational appeal\nTechnical achievement\nFeatured reviews\n9\ndunmore_ego (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2446936/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_uname)\nPlastic Fantastic. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/reviews/?featured=rw1382906&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_hd)\nY'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking!\nIn Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and \"plastic corrosion awareness meetings,\" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops \"in the field\" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.\nDirected by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels Â in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature Â just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the \"real people\") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.\nThe \"Disney Movie\" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.\nSure, there are \"messages,\" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, \"Clearly I will go sailing no more,\" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idÃ©e fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.\nBuzz Â who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of \"playing inert\" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as \"Mrs. Nesbitt\"). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, \"This is not flying - this is falling with style,\" simply seals this movie's greatness.\nAt least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing systemÂ.\n9\nphilip_vanderveken (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3922673/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_uname)\nCreated a decade ago, but still stunning (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/reviews/?featured=rw0984980&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_hd)\nI am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.\nThe movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...\nWhen you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.\nbob the moo (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_uname)\nTechnically impressive with great script and sharp wit (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/reviews/?featured=rw0373152&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_hd)\nAndy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.\nGiven how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.\nThe plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.\nLooking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.\nOverall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!\n10\nccthemovieman-1 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4445210/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_uname)\nExcellent Viewing, Every Time! (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/reviews/?featured=rw1602122&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_hd)\nThis is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.\nWhen this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.\nThe humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \"Woody\" and Allen as \"Buzz Armstrong,\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.\nMultiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \"winner\" as is the sequel.\n9\nSmileysWorld (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1350313/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_uname)\nProof that Pixar not only cares about the quality of their work,they care about our kids. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/reviews/?featured=rw1250633&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_hd)\nThough I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library.\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435761/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n8.3\nToy Story 3 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435761/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120363/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n7.9\nToy Story 2 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120363/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n8.2\nFinding Nemo (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n8.1\nMonsters, Inc.

profoundly jealous when a new spaceman action figure supplants him as the top toy in a boy's bedroom. When circumstances separate them from their owner, the duo have to put aside their differences to return to him.\nA little boy named Andy loves to be in his room, playing with his toys, especially his doll named \"Woody\". But, what do the toys do when Andy is not with them, they come to life. Woody believes that his life (as a toy) is good. However, he must worry about Andy's family moving, and what Woody does not know is about Andy's birthday party. Woody does not realize that Andy's mother gave him an action figure known as Buzz Lightyear, who does not believe that he is a toy, and quickly becomes Andy's new favorite toy. Woody, who is now consumed with jealousy, tries to get rid of Buzz. Then, both Woody and Buzz are now lost. They must find a way to get back to Andy before he moves without them, but they will have to pass through a ruthless toy killer, Sid Phillips.\nâ\nJohn Wiggins (https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?plot_author=John%20Wiggins&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=ttpl_pl_2)\nWoody, a good-hearted cowboy doll who belongs to a young boy named Andy, sees his position as Andy's favorite toy jeopardized when his mom buys him a Buzz Lightyear action figure. Even worse, the arrogant Buzz thinks he's a real spaceman on a mission to return to his home planet. When Andy's family moves to a new house, Woody and Buzz must escape the clutches of maladjusted neighbor Sid Phillips and reunite with their boy.\nâ\nJwelch5742 (https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?plot_author=Jwelch5742&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=ttpl_pl_3)\nThe film takes place in a world where toys come to life whenever their owners are not looking. It is in this world where we focus on the toys belonging to one Andy Davis. Andy's favourite toy is a cowboy doll named Woody, who often acts as the leader or \"man with a plan\" for the other toys. During an early birthday celebration, Andy receives an action figure of the famous Buzz Lightyear. However, trouble arises when this new toy begins attracting the attention of not just Andy, but the other toys as well; making Woody jealous. Things get way out of hand when both Woody and Buzz are snatched away from Andy and end up in the hands of his maniacal neighbour. Together, the two toys must set aside their differences and escape.\nâ\nAffan Jamsari (https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?plot_author=Affan%20Jamsari&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=ttpl_pl_4)\nWithout a doubt, the most popular toy in young Andy's room is gangling Woody, a dated pull-string sheriff doll basking in the glory of his success. But all good things must come to an end. And when intrepid space ranger Buzz Lightyear--a modern, battery-operated action figure--finds its way into the house as a birthday present, Woody realises nothing lasts forever. And then, as the sophisticated newcomer sparks the annoyed cowboy's jealousy, an unforeseen complication separates the two rivals from their owner. As a result, Woody and Buzz have no choice but to set aside their differences and venture into the great unknown with reunion etched on their minds. But it's a jungle out there. Will the clashing companions discover what they're made of, survive the real world, and pull off a surprise victory for Andy's sake?\nâ\nNick Riganas (https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?plot_author=Nick%20Riganas&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=ttpl_pl_5)\n1 more\nAll\nSynopsis (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/plotsummary#synopsis)\nA group of sentient toys, who pretend to be lifeless when humans are around, are preparing to move into a new house with their young owner Andy Davis (John Morris), his infant sister Molly (Hannah Unkrich), and their single mother Mrs. Davis (Laurie Metcalf). Andy's birthday is also coming up and Mrs. Davis is throwing a party for the same.\nSid (Erik Von Detten) is Andy's next-door neighbor and bully, who destroys toys for fun. Hannah (Sarah Freeman) is Sid's friendly sister.\nLearning that Andy's birthday party has been unexpectedly moved to that very day, several toys - including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) a cynical potato-shaped doll with put-together pieces on his body, Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) a dachshund slinky toy and Woody's second-in-command, Rex the tyrannosaur (Wallace Shawn) a nervous green Tyrannosaurus figurine, Hamm (John Ratzenberger) a smart talking piggy bank, and Bo Peep (Annie Potts) a porcelain shepherdess doll and Woody's love interest become concerned that Andy might receive something that will replace them.\nWoody, a pull string cowboy doll, and Andy's favorite toy and their leader, is the only toy who gets to say his own lines because he has a pull-string that makes him say things.\nWoody starts by reminding them all to find a moving buddy so they don't get lost when the Davis family moves to their new house, which will happen in a week. Then he tries to downplay the news that Andy's birthday party is happening today, but it causes a commotion as the toys know that Andy's actual birthday isn't till next week. Rex worries that someone will give Andy another dinosaur, and many of the toys have similar concerns. He's interrupted when Hamm the piggy-bank, stationed near the window, announces that the guests are arriving. The toys rush to the window to see the presents the kids are bringing; the bigger boxes make them especially nervous.\nTo calm them, Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) sends Sarge (R. Lee Ermey) the leader of a large troop of plastic green army men, and his green army men to spy on Andy's birthday party with a baby monitor.\nAt first, the presents seem nonthreatening including a lunchbox, bed sheets and a Battleship game.\nAndy receives a space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) a Space Ranger Universe Protection unit action figure, whose interesting features threaten Woody's position as Andy's favorite toy. The new toy has taken Woody's place on the bed, which causes consternation. Woody reminds them that no one is being replaced.\nBuzz does not realize that he is a toy when Woody attempts to convince him and thinks that he is a real space ranger. Buzz believes he's crash landed on a strange planet on the way to sector 12, and his ship is damaged. The toys impressed with Buzz's features including a laser (a little light bulb that blinks), and wings. Buzz takes exception to being called a toy, and when Woody says he can't really fly, Buzz climbs the bedpost, shouts \"to infinity and beyond!\", and dives. He bounces off a rubber ball, does a loop-De-loop on the racetrack, and gets stuck for a few rotations on the toy plane tethered to the ceiling before flipping down and landing neatly back on the bed. While the other toys befriend Buzz, Woody becomes jealous of him and starts to feel left out when Andy starts going to sleep with Buzz.\nAndy has Buzz shoot Woody, then puts on a cardboard replica of Buzz's helmet and wings. A western-themed poster in Andy's room is replaced by two Buzz Lightyear posters, and drawings of Woody on the bulletin board are covered with drawings of Buzz. The western-style bedspread disappears, and the new one is emblazoned with Buzz's image and his name. In the final indignity, Andy takes Buzz to bed and leaves Woody in the covered wagon toy chest.\nTwo days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet and Andy is told that he can bring one toy with him. Andy prepares to go to a family outing at a space-themed Pizza Planet restaurant with Buzz. Still wanting to stay close to Andy, and still jealous of Buzz, Woody tries knocking Buzz behind the desk with RC, the radio-controlled car.\nAndy's attempt starts a chain reaction that knocks Buzz out a window instead into Andy's next-door neighbor, Sid Phillips yard. However, most of the other toys believe Woody has deliberately killed Buzz.\nWith Buzz missing, Andy takes Woody to Pizza Planet with him instead. However, Buzz climbs into the car and confronts Woody when they stop at a gas station. The two toys fight and accidentally fall out of the car, which drives off and leaves them behind. Woody sees a pickup truck bound for Pizza Planet and plans to rendezvous with Andy there, convincing Buzz to come with him by saying that the pickup truck can take him to his home planet.\nThey reach Pizza Planet and hide in discarded food packaging so they can sneak through the front door. Woody quickly spots the Davises.\nOnce at Pizza Planet, Buzz makes his way into a claw game machine shaped like a spaceship, thinking that it is the ship that Woody had promised him to take him back home. Inside, he finds a horde of squeaky aliens (Jeff Pidgeon) who revere the machine's claw arm as their master. When Woody follows Buzz into the game to try to rescue him, the two of them are captured by Sid, who likes to torture and destroy toys for fun. Sid takes them back to his house. Sid immediately gives the three-eyed alien to his vicious dog, Scud, who starts chewing on it.\nAt Sid's house, the two toys stage numerous attempts to escape before Andy's moving day, encountering nightmarish Hodge-Podge toys of Sid's creation. There's an erector-set spider with a one-eyed baby head, a jack-in-the-box whose jack has been replaced by a green rubber hand, a fishing pole with legs, and other horrors. Buzz thinks they're cannibals.\nNext morning, Sid interrogates Woody about the location of a \"rebel base.\" When Woody remains silent, Sid uses a magnifying glass to concentrate the sunlight on a spot between Woody's eyebrows, which starts to smoke. Woody is saved when Sid is called away to eat his Pop-tarts. Buzz compliments Woody for not succumbing to Sid's torture. Buzz tries his laser on them and is puzzled when it doesn't work. Woody pushes the button that activates Buzz's karate-chop action and frog-marches him through the crowd of toys, which parts to let them through.\nIn the living room, the TV is on and Buzz sees a commercial for Buzz Lightyear action figures just like himself and realizes that Woody was right about him being a toy. Unable to face the truth, Buzz tries to prove he is still a space ranger by attempting to fly out of the window but falls and loses one of his arms. Buzz falls into depression over the truth, making him unable to participate in Woody's escape plan which forces Woody to try and get the other toys attention in Andy's room by waving Buzz's disconnected arm, but the other toys leave him behind as they still resent Woody for what happened to Buzz.\nWoody realizes that Sid's mutant toys are friendly when they fix Buzz's arm, but is still unable to make Buzz co-operate, forcing him to leave him behind and hide when Sid arrives. Sid prepares to destroy Buzz by strapping him to a rocket but is delayed by a thunderstorm and sleeps for the night.\nNext door, it's Andy's bedtime and he's mourning the loss of his two favorite toys. His mom comes in and says she's looked everywhere, and all she can find is his hat, which she gives him. Andy's mom reassures him that they'll find Woody and Buzz before they move out the next day.\nWoody convinces Buzz life is worth living even if he is not a space ranger because of the joy he can bring to Andy, and helps Buzz regain his spirit. Sid takes Buzz out to blow him up, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to come to life in front of Sid and frighten him into never harming toys again.\nWoody outlines a plan and assigns tasks to each toy. Ducky and Legs go into the heating ducts to avoid Scud, who saw Woody trying to follow Sid and is still growling outside the bedroom door. Ducky and Legs get outside by removing the light fixture on the front porch, then ring the doorbell. When he hears the doorbell, Woody releases a wind-up frog from Sid's room. The frog scoots under Scud and zooms down the hall. Scud gives chase and follows the frog downstairs, where Hannah's answering the door. The frog goes out, Ducky grabs it, and they're both reeled up by Legs (who's part fishing pole) before Scud catches up. Hannah, exasperated, shuts the door, leaving Scud outside. The porch light fixture drops back into place before anyone notices it's gone.\nAs soon as Hannah's out of the front hall, Woody and his cadre of toys come down the stairs, roll through the kitchen, and exit through the cat flap in the back door. They land in the bushes, where they have a good view of the launch site. Sid's newscaster voice is asking his mission control voice if launch pad construction is complete; mission control says it is. Sid himself is out of sight, apparently rummaging around in the shed looking for matches. Ducky, Legs, and the wind-up frog pop out of a down-spout as Sid prepares to start the count-down.\nThe launch pad looks very strange. Buzz and his rocket are standing on a dart board on a milk crate. Nearby is an orange-striped traffic horse with a rake leaning on it and the empty water jug propped underneath. The jug is connected with vacuum-cleaner hose to a red funnel, which is aimed at Buzz's feet.\nWoody approaches Buzz, who's happy to see him and asks for help getting loose. Sid tosses Woody on the charcoal grill. He puts a match in Woody's holster and turns back to his rocket launch, where he lights another match and starts counting down from 10. While he's focused on this, toys are taking up positions all around the yard.\nBefore Sid can light Buzz's fuse, Woody's voice recordings start playing, one after another. Sid is distracted and comes over to pick Woody up off the grill. His string hasn't been pulled. A large toy pickup truck emerges from a pile of sand while a couple of partially dismembered soldier action figures rise out of a puddle.\nThey all advance on Sid, who backs away and jumps when the three-eyed alien from Pizza Planet pops out from under Scud's red water bowl. Sid backs toward the clothesline and the baby-headed spider drops down on his head. He shrieks and shakes it off, but the toys have him surrounded. Sid is panic-stricken. He screams, throws Woody in the air, and runs into the house, where he tells Hannah the toys are alive.\nWoody and Buzz miss Andy's car as it drives away to his new house. Now freed, Woody and Buzz pursue the Davis's moving truck, but Scud attacks Woody.\nRunning down the road, they climb onto a moving truck, but Scud chases them. Woody can't hold on to the truck and tells Buzz to take care of Andy for him. Buzz, sacrificing himself to save Woody, jumps on Scud's head, making him let go of Woody.\nWoody attempts to rescue Buzz with Andy's RC car but the other toys, who think that Woody got rid of RC, toss Woody off onto the road. RC sweeps Woody off his feet and Woody turns RC up to turbo so they can catch up to the moving truck.\nSpotting Woody driving RC back with Buzz alive, the other toys realize their mistake and try to help them into the truck. When RC's batteries become depleted, RC coughs to a stop in the middle of the road as the moving van disappears in the distance. Then Buzz remembers he still has a rocket strapped to his back, and Woody remembers he still has the match Sid put in his holster.\nWoody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the moving truck just in time before they go soaring into the air. Buzz then opens his wings to cut himself free before the rocket explodes. They pass the truck again and fall through the minivan's sunroof, landing neatly in the box next to Andy, who finds them and gleefully tells his mom. She assumes they've been in the car the whole time.\nOn Christmas Eve at their new house, Buzz and Woody stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals, one of which is a Mrs. Potato Head, much to the delight of Mr. Potato Head. Woody jokingly asks Buzz \"What could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?\", a question which is immediately answered. Andy's new gift, as it turns out, is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.\nContribute to this page (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?ref_=ttpl_cn_edt&edit=legacy%2Ftitle%2Ftt0114709%2Fplotsummary)\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nLearn more about contributing (https://contribute.imdb.com/czone?ref_=ttpl_cn_cz)\n[No Text] (https://contribute.imdb.com/czone?ref_=ttpl_cn_cz)\nEdit page (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?ref_=ttpl_cn_edt&edit=legacy%2Ftitle%2Ftt0114709%2Fplotsummary)\nMore from this title\nMore to explore\nList (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=ttpl_sw_staffpicks_em00081_i)\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in August (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=ttpl_sw_staffpicks_em00081_t)\nSee our picks (https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/staff-picks/?ref_=ttpl_c_sw_staffpicks_em00081_cta)\nEditorial lists\nRelated lists created by IMDb editors\nAnimated Adventures for Allupdated 3 months agoâ¢51 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls592567056/?ref_=ttpl_edls_1)\nEvery Pixar Movie Ranked by IMDb Ratingupdated 8 months agoâ¢28 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls525761865/?ref_=ttpl_edls_2)\nTop 100 Movies Bucket Listupdated 1 year agoâ¢100 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls091520106/?ref_=ttpl_edls_3)\nPixar at the box office: see the opening weekend statsupdated 2 years agoâ¢24 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls520289803/?ref_=ttpl_edls_4)\n5 top-rated Disney-Pixar movies, according to IMDb usersupdated 2 years agoâ¢5 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls520738434/?ref_=ttpl_edls_5)\nMovies That Changed My Lifeupdated 4 years agoâ¢104 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls089636378/?ref_=ttpl_edls_6)\nList (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=ttpl_pks_augl25tv_i)\nAugust 2025 TV and Streaming Premiere Dates (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=ttpl_pks_augl25tv_t)\nSee the list (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=ttpl_c_pks_augl25tv_cta)\nUser lists (https://www.imdb.com/lists/tt0114709/?ref_=ttpl_urls_sm)\nRelated lists from IMDb users\nCreate a list (https://www.imdb.com/list/create/?ref_=ttpl_urls)\nAnimationcreated 3 years agoâ¢36 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls532009949/?ref_=ttpl_urls_1)\nAnimation / Animated filmscreated 11 years agoâ¢26 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls058869035/?ref_=ttpl_urls_2)\nEvery Pixar Animation Studios Film from (1995-2025)created 3 months agoâ¢34 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls592768432/?ref_=ttpl_urls_3)\nMovies Completedcreated 4 years agoâ¢49 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls505299249/?ref_=ttpl_urls_4)\nAnimationcreated 1 year agoâ¢23 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls521648328/?ref_=ttpl_urls_5)\nCaricaturascreated 3 months agoâ¢22 titles (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls592584455/?ref_=ttpl_urls_6)\nUser polls (https://www.imdb.com/poll/?ref_=ttpl_urpl_sm)\nRelated polls from IMDb users\nIt's All Good in the Neighborhood (https://www.imdb.com/poll/CJLz6BdK2ww/?ref_=ttpl_urpl_1)\nWorldwide Box Office (https://www.imdb.com/poll/xK2EgwjMa_g/?ref_=ttpl_urpl_2)\nThe Best Animated Movie by Disney (https://www.imdb.com/poll/HaFhtDUiSV4/?ref_=ttpl_urpl_3)\nShortest Movies in the IMDb Top 250 (https://www.imdb.com/poll/Lumc2Z3QY4E/?ref_=ttpl_urpl_4)\nBest Buddy Movies (https://www.imdb.com/poll/T__IpRcojb8/?ref_=ttpl_urpl_5)\nBest movies about toys coming to life.

It promotes unity, acceptance, tolerance, and overcoming stereotypes. The film encourages challenging assumptions, persevering through adversity, and recognizing shared humanity. It also critiques systemic corruption and stresses integrity in leadership. The narrative highlights perseverance and pursuing dreams despite societal expectations and obstacles, making it both thought-provoking and entertaining.\nAI-generated from the text of user reviews\nAmbitious\nCharacter chemistry\nCharacter development\nComedic brilliance\nCultural diversity\nInspirational\nSocial commentary\nSocial issues\nVisual artistry\nWorld-building\nFeatured reviews\n8\nKeyan-the-Eagle144 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur49417836/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_uname)\nOne of the best of the recent Disney CGI cartoons (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/reviews/?featured=rw4011838&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_hd)\nAs much as I liked movies like Toy Story and Finding Nemo, it made me curious about other CGI animated movies. I didn't actually see this movie in theaters, but I did rent it and was pleasantly surprised. Not everything is in black and white in this movie, and various stereotypes are broken. And things are not always what they seem. I loved the main characters and they all get my standing ovation. This, along with Wreck-It Ralph and Big Hero 6 are my favorites of the non-Pixar Disney CGI films. If you like anthro animals and want to see them in a somewhat modern setting with no humans, look no further!\n8\nCasuallViewer (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102266923/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_uname)\nAn entertaining and adventurous experience for the young ones and an empowering and relevant message for the more mature ones. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/reviews/?featured=rw4822803&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_hd)\n\"A little bit of kindness goes a long way\" would be a perfect quote for this film.\nWhen Judy Hopps, a country rabbit, shoots for her dreams as a part of the police force in Zootopia(Zootropolis), things weren't what she expected it to be. She was forced to face reality for what it truly was. Sound familiar?\nIt may have delivered a couple of messages that people have already heard dozens of times, but that doesn't take away the strength it gives to those who believe that what matters the most is trying to do things right in their lives and in society. I wasn't expecting to find this to be a source of encouragement and inspiration, but that's what it delivered. The \"true\" conflict presented was also as relevant as it was when this film was released. A divide that caused unrest among the ones that should be working towards improving society.\nOne small crutch from the plot was its use of circumstance to move the story along. But overall, this can be overlooked since after all, it isn't only with wits or pure strength alone that would allow a person to find solutions to the problems that they face in their lives.\nUsing cartoons as a medium to convey the kind of messages it did was also a brilliant move on the part of the producer and creators of this film. It would be a good and effective learning material for parents or older people to use to teach young people as a way to prepare and make them understand how the world works.\nBrilliant movie.\n10\nkukuhrahayu (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102886138/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_uname)\nZootopia : The Inspiring Movie (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/reviews/?featured=rw4847072&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_hd)\nZootopia is a 3D animation movie produced by Walt Disney. Zootopia is a big city over there. Like its name, this city contains all animal characters such a zoo as well. We can find so many animal characters here and of course they bring their own characteristics. They are rabbits, foxes, goats, sheeps, wolfs, lion, sheep, rhinoceros, and any others. And the main character is a bunny or we know it as a rabbit called Judy Hopps. Ya, just a little rabbit who has wanted to be a policewoman since she was child while there was no rabbit be police. There is no matter if the citizen are just rabbits, but the problem is the citizen are not only rabbits but all of animals are over there. There are many big and strong animals such rhinoceros or lions who are more appropriate to be police than just a bunny. She had been underestimated by every one for dreaming to be police, even by her parents. But it was not a problem for her, even she must pass many difficulties, she just kept trying and trying and finally she got appreciation to be the best police since she could finish a mission of a case and found something new on it.\n1. Animation\nThe animation moving is very smooth such as another 3D animation movie. The characters are drawn well, suit to their characteristic. We can know directly how is a character's feature even just see them, not watch them. It run a same way when some characters turn characteristic, from good to bad or vice versa, we can know it directly by their expression. It eases children to know how feature of the characters are, so they won't be confused by watching this movie especially when some characters change their appanage. This movie has a beautiful color, contras but still in harmony and it makes gazer, from children to adult, be able to enjoy this movie well.\n2. Score\nFor me, every single sound in this movie is nice, very nice. From the dubbing, sound effect, and of course the sound track. The sound track, Try Everything by Shakira, is very representative that movie and it suits when it played while Judy Hopps was enjoying her journey from her hometown to Zootopia. So, we, as gazer, can enjoy both of picture and the song.\n3. Plot twist\nThis is the most unexpected part of this movie when Mrs. Bellwether changed into a bad character. In the beginning, she was very good and helpful to Judy, but it turned out that she was a mastermind of all of \"disaster\" in the movie. This part gives us some breaks when we have a bit been bored think who is the mastermind of the problem.\n4. Moral Value\nSame as its soundtrack, this movie reminds us not to give up on everything, just keep trying and trying, trying everything and making something new. Life is all about problems, problems always come and leave. One problem has been solved and another problem will come to us, of course, that's a life. And for facing our problem, just ignore people say for braking our dream, just keep trying and prove that we can do for reaching our dream. And don't be afraid to fall on our journey, believe in ourselves that we can, we can, and we can.\nThis movie was very impressive to me when I watched in 2016, I was in senior high school. I had a dream that it was very difficult for me at that time. It made me doubt that I could reach my dream. By watching this movie, I cried and created an advice for my own, \"Believe in yourself that you can reach what you want as long as you want to try more, more and more, nothing impossible in this world.\" Moreover, the plot twist reminds us for not to ease believing someone and not to judge a book by its cover.\nFor me, this movie has almost no lack. This film is very recommended for watching by everyone, from children to adult, even elderly, because of its own picture and its value. For children who haven't been able to understand the value, they can enjoy the beautiful picture, the cute characters and moments, and of course the song. And for another, they can remind themselves by value of this movi\n8\namr_hamada (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71181162/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_uname)\nDidn't expect the story to be that great ! (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/reviews/?featured=rw5107437&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_hd)\nI surprisingly shocked by how great the story is, and the plot twist was pretty good too.. i didn't expect that comin'...\nIt also has a good message about diversity and acceptin' each other. It's really a good movie with alot of funny scenes.. and ofc won't forget to mention Shakira' song which was beautiful btw.\nrogerdarlington (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1911738/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_uname)\nYou certainly don't need to be a kid to love this movie (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/reviews/?featured=rw3449671&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_hd)\nA staple of children's movies is to give animals human characteristics, whether it is our feathered friends in the \"Rio\" series or our furry friends in the \"Alvin And The Chipmunks\" franchise. What is different about \"Zootropolis\" - called \"Zootopia\" in the USA - is that this is not one breed of talking animals existing in a human world, but every breed of animal inhabiting a world in which there are no humans. The colourful representation of this world, the engaging variety of characters, and the clever script with a message of tolerance and inclusion make for a wonderful movie from Walt Disney Productions.\nThe basic story is a kind of \"Lethal Weapon\" pairing of two unlikely partners in crime- fighting: a female rabbit called Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and a shady fox called Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). In pursuit of a missing person (sorry, animal), they encounter all sorts of adventures and a cast of characters ranging from sloths who will not be hurried to a Mr Big who turns out to be a tiny version of \"The Godfather\" concluding with a singing gazelle (Shakira). I took my five year old granddaughter to see the movie and she loved it, finishing up dancing in the aisles.\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3521164/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n7.6\nMoana (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3521164/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n7.4\nFrozen (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n7.7\nTangled (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2245084/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n7.8\nBig Hero 6 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2245084/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_4)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772341/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_5)\n7.7\nWreck-It Ralph (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772341/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_5)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_6)\n8.1\nInside Out (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_6)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_7)\n8.1\nRatatouille (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_7)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_8)\n7.9\nShrek (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_8)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120363/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_9)\n7.9\nToy Story 2 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120363/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_9)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_10)\n8.4\nCoco (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_10)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323594/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_11)\n7.6\nDespicable Me (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323594/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_11)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_12)\n7.6\nKung Fu Panda (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_12)\nStoryline (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/#storyline)\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt2948356/storyline&ref_=tt_stry)\nDid you know\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt2948356/fun-facts&tt_dyk)\nTrivia (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/trivia/?ref_=tt_dyk_trv)\nAnimators decided upon Judy's purple eye color because they thought the rest of her gray fur markings were too dull, particularly for a main character.

While there, she runs into a con artist fox named Nick Wilde, and they have to work together after an incident threatens Zootopia.\n1 more\nAll\nSynopsis (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/plotsummary#synopsis)\nIn the town of Bunnyburrow, 9-year-old bunny, Judy Hopps (Della Saba) is performing in a school play. Her theme explains that animals, once primitive and wild, have now evolved to where predators and prey can live side by side in harmony. The founding mammal city, Zootopia, is hailed as a place where anyone can be anything. Judy then announces that she wants to be a police officer.\nA kid fox in the audience, Gideon Grey (Phil Johnston), sneers at the idea and even Judy's parents, Bonnie (Bonnie Hunt) and Stu (Don Lake) tell her that there's never been a bunny officer. However, Judy is willing to try against all odds.\nWhen Judy sees Gideon bullying some kids by taking their fair tickets, she boldly confronts him, but Gideon responds by taunting Judy's dreams and slashing her in the face. He leaves and, though she's hurt, Judy shows her friends the tickets she got back and declares that she doesn't know when to quit.\nYears later, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her childhood dream of becoming a police officer in urban Zootopia. Judy is tiny compared to the other recruits and faces difficulties managing the obstacle courses run by the drill sergeant (Fuschia!). But through sheer determination, and by using her wits, Judy makes it to graduation as valedictorian. Zootopia Mayor Lionheart (J.K. Simmons) oversees the ceremony and Assistant Mayor Bellwether (Jenny Slate), a sheep, formally congratulates Judy as the first bunny police officer, saying it's a big day for all small animals.\nA few days after, Judy, her parents, and many siblings head to the train station. Stu convinces Judy to take a can of fox repellent with her before she gets on the train to Zootopia. Judy listens to a hit by pop singer, Gazelle (Shakira), as she zooms through the diverse districts of the city, from the frozen tundra to the sultry rain-forest. She finds her apartment, a run-down single room with a rickety bed, paper-thin walls, and two noisy neighbors, Bucky (Byron Howard) and Pronk Oryx-Antlerson ( Jared Bush).\nDespite being the police academy valedictorian, Judy is relegated to parking duty by Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), who doubts her potential because she is a rabbit. Judy is disappointed but sets her standards high and uses her sharp ears to help her write 200 tickets before noon.\nOn her first day at the Zootopia Police Department / ZPD, she is hustled by Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) and Finnick (Tom Lister Jr.), a con artist duo of foxes. Finnick acts as a child, who is desperate to get a jumbo pop on his birthday. Nick is acting his father. They con Judy into buying them a jumbo pop, which they later melt and refreeze into hundreds of mini pops which they sell to school kids, on which they make a healthy profit. The pop sticks, they sell to a rat construction site, selling it as red-wood. Judy observes the whole operation and later confronts Nick. Nick doesn't deny that he's a hustler but provides Judy with all the paperwork he needs to make his endeavors technically legal and humbles her by saying that the city is not a magical land where dreams come true and a meter maid can never be a real cop.\nThe next day, Judy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton (Alan Tudyk), a thief who stole plant crocus bulbs. Bogo reprimands her for abandoning her post (as the parking ticket officer). An otter named Mrs. Otterton (Octavia Spencer) enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen predators who have gone missing. Judy volunteers, and Bogo attempts to fire her for insubordination.\nThe city's assistant mayor, ewe Dawn Bellwether (Jenny Slate) arrives at the station and Otterton pleads her case to Bellwether and says how Judy volunteered to help her. Bellwether praises Judy for taking the assignment, Bogo agrees but demands Judy's resignation if she cannot close the case within 48 hours.\nAfter determining Nick was the last one to see Otterton. On the last seen photo of Emmit, Judy notices that Nick is eating a Popsicle which looks exactly like what Nick was selling the other day. Judy blackmails Nick into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to tax evasion.\nHe then takes them into the oasis to find Emmitt's yoga instructor, an elephant named Nangi (Gita Reddy), and Judy is shocked to find the oasis is a haven for naturalists or nude animals. Nangi has no memory of Otterton, but Yax unwittingly gives Judy all the information she needs, including the plate number for the car Otterton was picked up in the last time he was there. Nick says he has a friend at the DMV who can help them run the plate number. There, Judy is disheartened to see that the DMV is run solely by sloths. By the time they exit, it's nighttime.\nThey track a limousine that picked up Emmitt. They search it, finding polar bear fur, claw marks all over the back seat, and Otterton's wallet. Nick recognizes an insignia on a drinking glass and realizes that the vehicle is owned by Mr. Big (Maurice LaMarche), an arctic shrew crime boss whom Nick has a history with. Nick sold him an expensive rug made from the fur of a skunk's behind.\nMr Big's henchmen capture Nick and Judy and bring them to Big. Big berates Nick for tarnishing his trust and the hospitality of his grandmother who he recently buried in the skunk rug and scolds him for returning on the day of his daughter's wedding. Mr. Big orders his bears to 'ice' Nick and Judy and they're held over a trap door in the floor that reveals icy water. Mr. Big's daughter, Fru Fru (Leah Latham), then walks in wearing her wedding dress and recognizes Judy as the bunny that saved her the previous day from being crushed by the doughnut.\nMr. Big reveals that Otterton was his florist, but he went \"savage\", reverted to a feral state, and attacked his chauffeur, Manchas (Jesse Corti). At his home, Manchas mentions that Otterton had been yelling about \"night howlers.\" Moments later, Manchas himself turns savage and chases the pair.\nJudy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help. When Bogo and other police arrive, however, Manchas had vanished. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick reminds Bogo she still has 10 hours to solve the case.\nOver the rain-forest, Nick explains that he was idealistic like Judy once. As a kid, he wanted nothing more than to join the Junior Ranger Scouts. His mother bought him a new uniform and he was excited to become part of the group, despite the fact that he was the only predator to join. Upon arriving, however, the other animals bullied and muzzled him, saying that he was stupid for thinking they'd trust a fox. After that day he decided he would never let anyone see that they had gotten to him and if people only thought of foxes as untrustworthy, then that's what he would be. Deciding there was no use in fighting prejudiced ideas about fox behavior, he became a con artist.\nJudy recalls that Assistant Mayor Bellwether offered to help them. Bellwether gives Judy and Nick access to the city's traffic-camera system. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, which Judy surmises are the \"night howlers\". They watch as the wolves' van drives through a tunnel but fails to come out the other side. Nick says that there's a maintenance tunnel and, if he were to do anything illegal, that's the route he'd take to avoid observation.\nThey find Otterton and the other missing predators imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Mayor Leodore Lionheart (J. K. Simmons) is keeping them hidden from the public, while a scientist tries to determine the cause of their strange behavior. The doctor has no answer and says that they must come forward to Chief Bogo but the Mayor refuses, saying his reputation as a predator official is at stake. Nick and Judy manage to get the evidence Judy recorded back to Bogo.\nLionheart and those involved are arrested and Bellwether becomes the new mayor. Lionheart protests that they still don't know why predators are going savage and he was trying to protect the public.\nJudy, praised for solving the case and now friends with Nick, asks him to join the ZPD as her partner. However, she upsets him at a press conference by suggesting a biological cause for the recent savage behavior. At a press conference, she accidentally implies the savageness epidemic was caused by the physiology that all predators possess. Disappointed and offended, Nick abandons Judy, whose comments incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia.\nA wedge is driven between the predator and prey populations, with prey acting fearful against all predators. Gazelle hosts a peaceful protest against discrimination, despite backlash, and savage attacks continue in the city as more predators go primal.\nTV network ZNN covers singer Gazelle's (Shakira) peace protest and the police misconduct against predators. Bellwether explains that with the population in Zootopia being 90% prey, she wants Judy as the face of the ZPD to inspire hope. But, wracked with guilt, Judy quits her job and returns to Bunnyburrow.\nBack in Bunnyburrow, Judy's parents explain that they've partnered up with Gideon and never would have done so had Judy not opened their eyes. Gideon is red fox from Bunnyburrow who used to bully the young rabbits and sheep when he was young. As an adult, he has made amends with those he picked on and became a much-respected baker. Gideon apologizes to Judy for what he did when he was younger, stating that his own insecurities manifested into unchecked rage, but Judy forgives him and says she knows a thing or two about being a jerk.\nJudy learns from her parents and her reformed childhood bully Gideon Grey (Phil Johnston) that \"night howlers\" are not wolves, but actually toxic flowers that have severe psychotropic effects on mammals.\nAfter she returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Nick, they confront Weaselton, who tells them the night howler bulbs he'd stolen earlier were for a ram named Doug (Rich Moore) an emotionless ram chemist and sniper with puffy wool who works for Assistant Mayor Bellwether. They find Doug in a lab hidden in the subway tunnels, creating an illegal drug made from night howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a dart gun. He loads a pellet into a gun as his phone rings, telling him his next mark is a cheetah in Sahara Square. He assures the caller he can make the hit since he was able to get an otter in a moving car.\nJudy and Nick obtain the dart gun and the serum and escape the facility in a car. They are chased by Doug's ram henchmen. After a fight, Nick manages to save the evidence as he and Judy defeat the henchmen Jesse and Woolter pursuing them.\nThey run upstairs out of the station and into the Natural History Museum, empty due to renovations. As they near the exit toward the police station they are called from behind by Mayor Bellwether, accompanied by two rams in police uniform. These rams are Jesse and Woolter.\nBut before they can go to the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them and steals the evidence, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-supremacist conspiracy. Bellwether calls out to Judy, saying that in the city prey outnumber predators 10 to 1. They need to band together to end their mistreatment against the more powerful and loud predators and, once united, will be unstoppable. Bellwether calls the police and feigns alarm, saying Officer Judy is down and being attacked by a savage fox. Bellwether says that fear always works and, with a predisposition to savagery, predators will be forced out of Zootopia, and she'll dart everyone to keep it that way.\nJudy and Nick are trapped in a pit after Nick refuses to abandon Judy when she is injured. Bellwether shoots a serum pellet at Nick to make him kill Judy, but Nick had disarmed Bellwether's dart gun by replacing the serum pellets with blueberries. Enraged, Bellwether threatens to frame Judy and Nick for the attacks like she framed Lionheart, but Judy has recorded Bellwether's confession on her pen recorder. Bogo and the ZPD arrive, and Bellwether is arrested.\nIn the news coverage that follows, Former Mayor Lionheart gives an interview where he says he didn't know about Bellwether's plot and only caged the savage predators to protect the city, citing he did a wrong thing for the right reasons. It is announced that an antidote has been created with positive effects. Judy goes to the hospital where she sees Emmitt Otterton recovering and embracing his concerned wife.\nJudy rejoins the ZPD, and Nick becomes the city's first fox police officer, as well as her partner. The next day, Chief Bogo hands out assignments, giving Nick and Judy the task of catching a hot-rod tearing up the roads downtown. Judy and Nick come across the speeder in their patrol car and pull him over, surprised to see Flash the sloth behind the wheel.\nContribute to this page (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?ref_=ttpl_cn_edt&edit=legacy%2Ftitle%2Ftt2948356%2Fplotsummary)\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nLearn more about contributing (https://contribute.imdb.com/czone?ref_=ttpl_cn_cz)\n[No Text] (https://contribute.imdb.com/czone?ref_=ttpl_cn_cz)\nEdit page (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?ref_=ttpl_cn_edt&edit=legacy%2Ftitle%2Ftt2948356%2Fplotsummary)\nMore from this title\nMore to explore\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg1788844800/mediaviewer/rm2726377729/?ref_=ttpl_sw_g_cs_i)\nChild Stars, Then and Now (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg1788844800/mediaviewer/rm2726377729/?ref_=ttpl_sw_g_cs_t)\nSee the gallery (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg1788844800/mediaviewer/rm2726377729/?ref_=ttpl_c_sw_g_cs_cta)\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg3677002496/mediaviewer/rm569618434/?ref_=ttpl_sw_g_ts_i)\nThese Stars Are on the Rise (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg3677002496/mediaviewer/rm569618434/?ref_=ttpl_sw_g_ts_t)\nSee the gallery (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg3677002496/mediaviewer/rm569618434/?ref_=ttpl_c_sw_g_ts_cta)\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-cosplay/rg499947520/mediaviewer/rm3297358338/?ref_=ttpl_csegsdcc_cosplay25_i)\nCosplay at San Diego Comic-Con 2025 (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-cosplay/rg499947520/mediaviewer/rm3297358338/?ref_=ttpl_csegsdcc_cosplay25_t)\nSee the incredible looks (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-cosplay/rg499947520/mediaviewer/rm3297358338/?ref_=ttpl_c_csegsdcc_cosplay25_cta)\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\nGet the IMDb App (https://slyb.app.link/SKdyQ6A449)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt2948356%2Fplotsummary%2F&ref_=ttpl_ftr_reg)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt2948356%2Fplotsummary%2F&ref_=ttpl_ftr_reg)\nFollow IMDb on social\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nGet the IMDb App\nFor Android and iOS\n[No Text] (https://slyb.app.link/Aa96cLcBeAb)\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nHelp (https://help.imdb.com/imdb)\nSite Index (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/general-information/imdb-site-index/GNCX7BHNSPBTFALQ#so)\nIMDbPro (https://pro.imdb.com?ref_=cons_tf_pro&rf=cons_tf_pro)\nBox Office Mojo (https://www.boxofficemojo.com)\nLicense IMDb Data (https://developer.imdb.com/)\nPress Room (https://www.imdb.com/pressroom/?ref_=ttpl_ftr)\nAdvertising (https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/imdb/)\nJobs (https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/imdb)\nConditions of Use (https://www.imdb.com/conditions/?ref_=ttpl_ftr)\nPrivacy Policy (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/?ref_=ttpl_ftr)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=ttpl_ftr)\nYour Ads Privacy Choices (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=ttpl_ftr)\nIMDb, an Amazon company\nÂ© 1990-\n2025\nby IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

The exploration of the multiverse and diverse Spider-Man characters is praised for originality. Character development, especially Miles Morales and Peter Parker, adds depth. However, some criticize pacing, plot inconsistencies, and over-reliance on visuals. Political and social themes receive mixed feedback. Voice acting and soundtrack are divisive, with some appreciating performances and others finding them lacking.\nAI-generated from the text of user reviews\nAction sequences\nAnimation style\nCharacter development\nComedic brilliance\nFamily dynamics\nSoundtrack\nVisual innovation\nSocial commentary\nFeatured reviews\n9\nmatthewssilverhammer (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19752191/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_uname)\nHow on God's green Earth did this work so well??? (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/reviews/?featured=rw4525715&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_hd)\nThe worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the \"extended universe\", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes.\nListen, I hear you. \"How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?\" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have?\nLook, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough.\n10\ncafesmitty (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1061970/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_uname)\nGame Changer (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/reviews/?featured=rw4523586&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_hd)\nHave you ever sat through a film and you knew that films would never be the same going forward? For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron Man\nWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.\nAnd the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.\nPlus our the villains are so well done..\nBut I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.\nIt's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.\nramy-bakir (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur56190323/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_uname)\nBest Spider-man movie yet (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/reviews/?featured=rw4513158&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_hd)\nA coming of age movie for the whole animation genre, which stays true to its medium while nicely embracing the comics medium.\nA really moving movie with an ambitious approach, that surprised me at how much spiderman is instilled in my psyche...even as much as Superman is.\nThe movie simply embraced how the character is a cultural phenomenon, and stopped treating it as merchandise.\n10\nvancewinstead (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur83657522/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_uname)\nGiving Infinity war a run for it's money (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/reviews/?featured=rw4512352&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_hd)\nThis movie was absolutely incredible. From the animation, to the storytelling, to the characters this movie is completely one of a kind. It is easily the best looking animated movie of the year (no surprise there), but what really caught me off guard was the story they were able to tell in such a short amount of time. Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated. I knew I would end up liking this movie, but this movie has completely exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy superheros or animation you should 100% definitely watch it in a theater.\n10\nsoulsplosion (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur93280127/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_uname)\nthe most visually stunning film I've ever seen (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/reviews/?featured=rw4521959&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_hd)\nThere's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time.

the Spider-Man of his universe and must join with five spider-powered individuals from other dimensions to stop a threat for all realities.\nPhil Lord and Christopher Miller, the creative minds behind The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street, bring their unique talents to a fresh vision of a different Spider-Man Universe, with a groundbreaking visual style that's the first of its kind. \"Spider-Man(TM): Into the Spider-Verse\" introduces Brooklyn teen Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), and the limitless possibilities of the Spider-Verse, where more than one can wear the mask.\nâ\nSony Pictures (https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?plot_author=Sony%20Pictures&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=ttpl_pl_2)\nMiles Morales has just started at a new school and is struggling to fit in. Then he is bitten by a radioactive spider and he obtains certain powers, similar to those of Spiderman. He doesn't know what to do with the powers, or how to control them, so naturally he turns to Spider-Man for advice.\nâ\ngrantss (https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?plot_author=grantss&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=ttpl_pl_3)\nStruggling to find his place in the world while juggling school and family, Miles Morales, a smart teenager from Brooklyn, reluctantly enrols in an elite New York City boarding school. Wrestling with his new responsibilities, Miles discovers a whole new world hidden at an abandoned NYC subway tunnel, only to get bitten by a stealthy radioactive arachnid from another dimension. Now, gifted with unfathomable powers, much like the original\nSpider-Man (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145487/?ref_=ttpl)\n, Miles is shocked to discover that life has become even more complicated, unbeknownst to him that he is about to get caught in the middle of a dreadful inter-dimensional conflict. More and more, with the fate of the multiverse hanging by a thread, young and utterly inexperienced Miles has no other choice but to master his newfound abilities, even though he believes that not everyone is cut out to be a hero. But a hero isn't the one who always wins. It's the one who always tries. Can Miles take a leap of faith and become Spider-Man?\nâ\nNick Riganas (https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?plot_author=Nick%20Riganas&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=ttpl_pl_4)\nSynopsis (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/plotsummary#synopsis)\nMiles Morales (Shameik Moore), a teenager who admires Spider-Man, struggles living up to the expectations of his parents, especially his father, police officer Jefferson Davis (Brian Tyree Henry), who sees Spider-Man as a menace. Miles lives with Jefferson and mother Rio (Luna Lauren Velez). Jefferson believes that the police put their life on the line on a daily basis without any superpowers and spider-man takes all the credit.\nMiles has recently been enrolled to new school which he considers elitist. Gwanda is his only friend at the new school and she is also a recently enrolled student.\nAfter school, Miles secretly visits his uncle Aaron Davis (Mahershala Ali) (The Prowler), who brings Miles to an abandoned subway station where he can paint graffiti. While there, Miles is unknowingly bitten by a radioactive spider and, the next day, discovers it gave him spider-like abilities, including the power to turn invisible, and to emit electric venom blasts.\nReading the comic books, Miles realizes that he is Spider-man. He is astonished that there can be 2 spider-men.\nSearching for the spider, Miles returns to the station and unintentionally discovers a particle accelerator built by Wilson Fisk (Liev Schreiber) (The Kingpin), who wishes to access parallel universes to find alternative versions of his wife and son who died in a car crash.\nSpider-Man (Chris Pine) tries to disable it while fighting Fisk's enforcers, Green Goblin (Jorma Taccone) and Prowler (his own uncle Aaron). Spider-Man saves Miles from falling into the particle accelerator.\nFisk activates the particle accelerator, and this opens pathways to multiple dimensions. Goblin pushes the Spider-Man into the beams of the particle accelerator.\nSpider-Man is gravely wounded by an explosion during the battle which kills Green Goblin. Spider-Man gives Miles, whom he previously found, a USB drive to disable the accelerator and warns that the machine could destroy the city if turned on again. Miles then watches in horror as Fisk kills Spider-Man. Spider-Man tells Fisk that he knows what Fisk is trying to do and it won't work as they are gone.\nThe news of Spider-Man's death then spreads all over the city. Meanwhile, due to the particle accelerator many items and people from parallel Universes enter Miles's Universe without anyone's knowledge.\nAfter purchasing a Spider-Man costume, Miles tries out his newfound abilities but, in the process, damages the USB drive. At Spider-Man's grave, Miles meets Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson) (Miles's reluctant mentor), a depressed, older, jaded, and worn-down version of Spider-Man from another dimension (Peter B Parker had been Spider-Man in his dimension for 22 years) who is divorced from his wife Mary Jane and whose Aunt May (Lily Tomlin) is deceased. One day, a portal opened in his dimension which sucked him in and deposited him in Miles's Universe.\nMiles understands that Peter2 came from a parallel dimension. Peter2 is not willing to collaborate with Miles, but he is very unstable in Miles's Universe. He needs to get back to his own dimension and cannot do that without activating the particle accelerator. To do that, Peter2 needs the data from Spider-Man's USB drive.\nPeter2 reluctantly agrees to train Miles (stuff like sanitize the mask and use baby powder inside the suit to prevent chafing, no cape) in exchange for help stealing data to create a new drive since the old one is destroyed. While breaking into Kingpin's research facility, they are confronted by Fisk's chief scientist Olivia Octavius (Kathryn Hahn), who reveals that Peter2 will deteriorate and die if he stays longer in their dimension.\nOlivia also knows that firing up the particle accelerator again will rip apart the space-time continuum and crash dimensions into one another. But she is the evil side-kick to Kingpin and wants to turn the machine back on.\nMiles and Peter2 are then rescued by Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) (Spider-Woman: An alternate universe version of Gwen Stacy with spider-like abilities, who takes up the alias of \"Gwanda\"), another dimension-displaced heroine.\nGwen, Peter2 and Miles find Peter's aunt, May Parker, who is sheltering dimension-displaced heroes Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage) (A dark and monochromatic alternate version of Peter Parker from a 1930s universe), Spider-Ham (Peter Porker, John Mulaney, An alternate funny animal version of Spider-Man from an anthropomorphic universe, who was once a spider, bitten by a radioactive pig), and Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn, A young Japanese-American girl from an alternative anime-like universe who co-pilots a bio-mechanical suit with a radioactive spider that she shares a telepathic link with), who are also deteriorating.\nMiles offers to disable the accelerator but is overwhelmed after being judged for his inexperience and inability to control his powers.\nMiles retreats to Aaron's home, where he discovers that Aaron is Prowler. He returns to May's house, where Peni has repaired the drive; however, he is followed by Fisk, Prowler, Octavius, Scorpion and Tombstone, leading to a brawl. Miles flees May's house but is captured by Prowler, who prepares to kill him. Miles unmasks himself in front of him. Unwilling to kill Miles, Aaron is killed by Fisk. Fisk then attempts to kill Miles but is subdued by Peter2. Jefferson sees Miles mourning over Aaron and concludes that Spider-Man killed him.\nThe Spider-People regroup with Miles in his dorm. Peter2 restrains Miles with his webs before heading out with the other Spider-People to face Fisk, deciding to sacrifice himself by taking Miles's place in deactivating the accelerator to ensure his safety. Jefferson arrives outside his door to tell him about Aaron's death and, assuming Miles does not want to speak to him, apologizes for his mistakes. Miles manages to control his powers and use his venom blast to escape the webbing.\nMiles goes to Aunt May's, where he gains web-shooters and spray paints Peter's classic suit, then joins the other Spider-People and helps them defeat Fisk's enforcers before activating the USB drive and sending them home. Fisk and Miles fight throughout the accelerator, attracting Jefferson's attention.\nJefferson realizes that Spider-Man is not the enemy and encourages him, giving Miles the motivation to defeat Fisk with his venom blast and throw him at the kill switch, destroying the accelerator. The authorities arrest Fisk, and his enforcers and Jefferson recognizes Spider-Man as a hero. Miles embraces the responsibilities of his new life. Back in their dimensions, Peter2 prepares to fix his relationship with Mary Jane, the other Spider-People return to their lives, and Gwen finds a way to contact Miles across dimensions.\nIn another dimension, Miguel O'Hara's assistant, Lyla, informs him of the crisis and gives him dimension-hopping technology. He decides to time travel to the beginning, and ends up arguing with that universe's Spider-Man.\nContribute to this page (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?ref_=ttpl_cn_edt&edit=legacy%2Ftitle%2Ftt4633694%2Fplotsummary)\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nLearn more about contributing (https://contribute.imdb.com/czone?ref_=ttpl_cn_cz)\n[No Text] (https://contribute.imdb.com/czone?ref_=ttpl_cn_cz)\nEdit page (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?ref_=ttpl_cn_edt&edit=legacy%2Ftitle%2Ftt4633694%2Fplotsummary)\nMore from this title\nMore to explore\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg1788844800/mediaviewer/rm2726377729/?ref_=ttpl_sw_g_cs_i)\nChild Stars, Then and Now (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg1788844800/mediaviewer/rm2726377729/?ref_=ttpl_sw_g_cs_t)\nSee the gallery (https://www.imdb.com/gallery/rg1788844800/mediaviewer/rm2726377729/?ref_=ttpl_c_sw_g_cs_cta)\nList (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=ttpl_pks_augl25tv_i)\nAugust 2025 TV and Streaming Premiere Dates (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=ttpl_pks_augl25tv_t)\nSee the list (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4784637319/?ref_=ttpl_c_pks_augl25tv_cta)\nPhotos (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=ttpl_csegsdcc_pwl25_i)\nPhotos We Love: San Diego Comic-Con 2025 (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=ttpl_csegsdcc_pwl25_t)\nSee the full gallery (https://www.imdb.com/comic-con/sdcc-2025-photos-we-love/rg516724736/mediaviewer/rm1787146754/?ref_=ttpl_c_csegsdcc_pwl25_cta)\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\nGet the IMDb App (https://slyb.app.link/SKdyQ6A449)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt4633694%2Fplotsummary%2F&ref_=ttpl_ftr_reg)\nSign in for more access (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin/?u=%2Ftitle%2Ftt4633694%2Fplotsummary%2F&ref_=ttpl_ftr_reg)\nFollow IMDb on social\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nGet the IMDb App\nFor Android and iOS\n[No Text] (https://slyb.app.link/Aa96cLcBeAb)\n[No Text] (https://www.tiktok.com/@imdb)\n[No Text] (https://instagram.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://twitter.com/imdb)\n[No Text] (https://youtube.com/imdb/)\n[No Text] (https://facebook.com/imdb)\nHelp (https://help.imdb.com/imdb)\nSite Index (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/general-information/imdb-site-index/GNCX7BHNSPBTFALQ#so)\nIMDbPro (https://pro.imdb.com?ref_=cons_tf_pro&rf=cons_tf_pro)\nBox Office Mojo (https://www.boxofficemojo.com)\nLicense IMDb Data (https://developer.imdb.com/)\nPress Room (https://www.imdb.com/pressroom/?ref_=ttpl_ftr)\nAdvertising (https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/imdb/)\nJobs (https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/imdb)\nConditions of Use (https://www.imdb.com/conditions/?ref_=ttpl_ftr)\nPrivacy Policy (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/?ref_=ttpl_ftr)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=ttpl_ftr)\nYour Ads Privacy Choices (https://www.imdb.com/privacy/redirect/?ref_=ttpl_ftr)\nIMDb, an Amazon company\nÂ© 1990-\n2025\nby IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

Story_ reinvigorated animation while heralding the arrival of Pixar as a family-friendly force to be reckoned with.\n\n[Read Critics Reviews](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/toy_story/reviews)\n\n David Denby  New York Magazine/Vulture  Toy Story takes a number of surprising turns, and though I didn't fall in love with it -- there's a lot of routine clobbering, scrambling, and zooming about -- I remained interested and happy until the end (and children, I think, will adore it).  Dec 31, 2019 Full Review Michael Rechtshaffen  The Hollywood Reporter  With \"instant classic\" written all over it, Toy Story, the first full-length feature entirely composed of computer-generated animation, is a visually astounding, wildly inventive winner.

And it does all this in a wonderfully fun film.\nDec 30, 2016\nFull Review\nStephanie Zacharek\nTIME Magazine\nThere are enough under-the-radar subtleties, rendered with a refreshing lack of smart-aleckiness, to make Zootopia feel current and fresh. It's a modest, unassuming entertainment that's motored by a sly sensibility.\nDec 30, 2016\nFull Review\nGrant Watson\nFiction Machine\nThis is the weird sort of film that is, on its own merits, perfectly well produced and entertaining, yet winds up being a slight disappointment because it feels as if it should have been somewhat better than it is.\nRated: 7/10\nâ¢\nOct 24, 2024\nFull Review\nBrendan Cassidy\nInSession Film\nNot just a great animated film, but an important one...\nRated: A\nâ¢\nJun 17, 2024\nFull Review\nPradeep Menon\nFirstpost\nDisneyâs Zootopia looks at the âotherizationâ prevalent at every step of our social structure.\nNov 1, 2023\nFull Review\nRead all reviews\nAudience Reviews\nView More (1000+)\nEmerson H.\nZootopia has a powerful and important message, all while being mysterious and funny.
