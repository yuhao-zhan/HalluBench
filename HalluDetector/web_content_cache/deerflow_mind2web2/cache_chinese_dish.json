(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EditPage/Template:Chinese_cuisine)\nChinese imperial cuisine\nis derived from a variety of cooking styles of the regions in China, mainly from the cuisines of\nShandong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_cuisine)\nand\nJiangsu (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu_cuisine)\nprovinces. The style originated from various\nEmperors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor)\n' Kitchen and the\nEmpress Dowagers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager)\n' Kitchen, and it is similar to\nBeijing cuisine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_cuisine)\nwhich it heavily influenced.\nImperial cuisine was served mainly to the emperors, their\nempresses (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress)\nand concubines, and the\nimperial family (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_family)\n. The characteristics of the Chinese imperial cuisine are the elaborate cooking methods and the strict selection of raw materials, which are often extremely expensive, rare or complicated in preparation. Visual presentation is also very important, so the colour and the shape of the dish must be carefully arranged. The most famous Chinese imperial cuisine restaurants are both located in\nBeijing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing)\n:\nFang Shan\n(\n仿膳\n;\nfǎngshàn\n) in\nBeihai Park (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beihai_Park)\nand\nTing Li Ting\n(\n聽鸝廳\n;\ntīng lí tīng\n) in the\nSummer Palace (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Palace)\n.\n[1] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-1)\nStyles and tastes of Chinese imperial cuisine vary from dynasty to dynasty. Every dynasty has its own distinguishing features. The two famous styles of Chinese imperial cuisine are from the\nMing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty)\nand\nQing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty)\ndynasties. Many famous dishes emerged in these dynasties, such as Wensi tofu and\nPeking duck (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_duck)\n.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-china.org-2)\nHistory\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_imperial_cuisine&action=edit&section=1)\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of Chinese cuisine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Chinese_cuisine)\nSee also:\nList of sources of Chinese culinary history (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sources_of_Chinese_culinary_history)\nIn the\nhistory of Chinese cuisine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Chinese_cuisine)\n, Chinese imperial cuisine experienced a development process which changed from simple to exquisite. Through the changing of dynasties, Chinese imperial cuisine was continually changing, improving and self-completing. Chinese imperial food originated around the\nZhou dynasty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty)\n(\nc.\n11th century – 476 BCE). Emperors used their power to collect best cuisines and best cooks from throughout the country. Therefore, from the Chinese people's perspective, imperial cuisine represented a dynasty's best cuisine.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-china.org-2)\nA complete system for imperial cuisine was developed which included procurement and diets preparation. Every process of making and serving imperial cuisine was done in a fixed order according to the \"eating principles\". Many famous dishes were developed through creating imperial food such as the six cereals stew which included rice, millet, broomcorn, sorghum, wheat and wild rice.\n[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-pre-3)\nImperial cuisine was closely related to preserving health. Several hundred writings about using food and diet therapy for better health have appeared throughout Chinese history. For example,\nThe Health Building of the People in the Song Dynasty\n, by\nSong Xu (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Xu)\n,\nthe Gentlemen's Remark on Diets\n, by\nChen Jiru (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Jiru)\n, and\nthe History of the Ming Palace - Preferences for Diets\n, by Liu Ruoyu in the Ming dynasty. Most of these books about diet therapy were written by scholars, literati, medical specialists or historians. Cooking and diet therapy to maintain good health formed an important part of Chinese imperial cuisine and Chinese dietetic culture.\n[4] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-4)\nAlthough only the imperial family was authorised to consume imperial cuisine, Chinese imperial cuisine comprised the dietetic culture of the Chinese palaces. The raw materials of imperial cuisines were provided by peasants, herders, and fisherman. The kitchen utensils were made by craftsmen. Imperial cuisine can also represent the efforts of the cooking staff who provided the service, civil officials who named the dishes, and protocol officials who drafted the dietary and culinary principles. Chinese imperial cuisine is a valuable part of Chinese traditional cuisine and cultural heritage.\n[5] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-5)\nImperial cuisine in the Ming dynasty\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_imperial_cuisine&action=edit&section=2)\n]\nImperial cuisine in the\nMing dynasty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty)\nwas mostly cooked with the flavours of\nsouthern China (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China)\nbecause of the preferences of\nZhu Yuanzhang (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongwu_Emperor)\n, the founder of the Ming dynasty.\n[6] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-acutimes-6)\nThe cuisine in the Ming palace totally changed the Mongolian style of food served during the\nMongol (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols)\n-led\nYuan dynasty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty)\n. The imperial cuisine of the Ming dynasty had one important characteristic, which was to maintain good health.\n[7] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-7)\nThe emperors of the Ming dynasty paid great attention to maintaining their health by eating healthy food. The menu of imperial cuisine changed daily and dishes were not repeated.\n[8] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-china.org3-8)\nImperial cuisine of the Ming dynasty was mainly grain-based. Therefore, meat and bean products were not as popular as they were in the former dynasties. In the\nQing dynasty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty)\n, a famous dish was sweet potatoes. Maize and chili peppers were also introduced in around the mid-16th century. Other famous dishes including\nshark's fin soup (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark%27s_fin_soup)\nand\nedible bird's nest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edible_bird%27s_nest)\nalso gained their fame during this period. Those two dishes were introduced to China by the explorer\nZheng He (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He)\nin the early Ming dynasty. While these two dishes were becoming examples of extravagant dishes,\nsea cucumbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_cucumber)\nand prawns were also brought into China. Many famous cooks and chefs such as Song Wusao and Wang Eryu emerged in the Ming dynasty.\n[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-pre-3)\nPopular dishes\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_imperial_cuisine&action=edit&section=3)\n]\nPeking duck\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_imperial_cuisine&action=edit&section=4)\n]\nMain article:\nPeking duck (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_duck)\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Peking_Duck_3.jpg)\nPeking duck\nPeking duck originated in the\nSouthern and Northern Dynasties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_and_Northern_Dynasties)\n(420–589 CE), specifically originated in Nanjing.\n[9] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-9)\nRoasted duck was first served as a dish in imperial cuisine during the\nYuan dynasty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty)\n. It developed fully and became an important part of imperial cuisine menus during the Ming dynasty. In contemporary society, Peking roasted duck has entered international cuisine. Peking roasted duck was famous because of its crispy skin and the juicy meat which left a deep impression on people eating it for the first time. Since the imperial era, the dish is admired for its thin, crispy skin sliced in front of the diners by the cook.\n[10] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-10)\nThere are unique techniques to serving and eating Peking duck for maximum enjoyment of its taste.\n[11] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-11)\nImperial cuisine in the Qing dynasty\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_imperial_cuisine&action=edit&section=5)\n]\nChinese imperial cuisine in the\nQing dynasty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty)\nwas developed basing on the traditional diet of the\nManchu ethnic group (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people)\nand\nShandong cuisine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_cuisine)\n.\n[12] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-Jacqueline-12)\nThe famous\nManchu Han Imperial Feast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_Han_Imperial_Feast)\nwas created during this dynasty. There was a special organisation, the Imperial Kitchen, within the Qing imperial palace which was responsible for creating and making imperial cuisine for the emperor. The Imperial Kitchen was managed by the General Office of Internal Affairs. During the reign of the\nQianlong Emperor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor)\n(\nr.\n1735–1796), the Imperial Kitchen was divided into the Internal Kitchen and the External Kitchen. The Internal Kitchen had departments for meat dishes, vegetables, roasting, baking and rice cooking. The External Kitchen prepared the palace banquets, feasts and sacrificial rites.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-china.org-2)\nDuring the Qing dynasty, the rites for the meals, the number of people, and the use, cost, variety and quality of sumptuous courses at each meal were the greatest of all the dynasties in China.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-china.org-2)\nPopular dishes\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_imperial_cuisine&action=edit&section=6)\n]\nDezhou braised chicken\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_imperial_cuisine&action=edit&section=7)\n]\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Single_Dezhou_braised_chicken_wrapped_in_paper_(20170115132902).jpg)\nDezhou braised chicken\nDezhou braised chicken (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dezhou_braised_chicken)\nis a traditional dish from\nDezhou City (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dezhou)\n,\nShandong Province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong)\nand it is named after its place of origin. When the\nQianlong Emperor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor)\ntravelled to Dezhou City, a\nHan Chinese (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese)\nfamily made braised chicken for him. The emperor thought highly of this dish and praised it as \"a wonder of all cuisine\". After eating Dezhou braised chicken, the Qianlong Emperor ordered that this dish be included in the menu of imperial cuisine.\n[13] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-chinatoday2-13)\nDezhou braised chicken features red glossy skin, tender texture, aromatic smell, and a juicy taste.\n[14] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-14)\nWensi tofu\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_imperial_cuisine&action=edit&section=8)\n]\nWensi tofu is a meal in\nJiangsu cuisine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu_cuisine)\n. It is a soup made of finely shredded\ntofu (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu)\nand different ingredients of different colours, such as\ncarrots (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot)\nand\ncucumbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber)\n. This dish represents the typical work of knife skill of a chef from\nYangzhou (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou)\nbecause a chef needs to cut a square of tofu into more than 5,000 pieces in order to make this soup.\n[15] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine#cite_note-15)\nDuring the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, there was a monk by the name of Wensi, who was famous for making vegetarian dishes, particularly those with tofu.

It is derived from the native cooking style of\nShandong Province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong)\n, a northern coastal\nprovince (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_China)\nof\nChina (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)\n.\nFeatures\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shandong_cuisine&action=edit&section=1)\n]\nShandong cuisine is famous for its wide selection of material and use of different cooking methods. The raw materials are mainly domestic animals and birds, seafood and vegetables. The masterly cooking techniques include\nbao\n(爆; quick frying),\nliu\n(溜; quick frying with corn flour),\npa\n(扒; stewing),\nkao\n(烤; roasting),\nzhu\n(煮; boiling), and coating sugar onto fruits with honey as the adhesive.\n[1] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_cuisine#cite_note-1)\nStyles\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shandong_cuisine&action=edit&section=2)\n]\nShandong cuisine is divided into two sub-regional styles: Jinan and Jiaodong. Shandong cuisine is known for its light aroma, freshness and rich taste.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nIt puts emphasis on two types of broths, light and milky. Both broths are seasoned with scallions and go well with the freshness of seafood.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nJiaodong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaodong)\nstyle, encompassing dishes from eastern Shandong:\nFushan (a district of Yantai) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushan_District)\n,\nQingdao (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao)\n,\nYantai (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yantai)\nand the surrounding regions. It is characterised by seafood dishes with a light taste.\n[\nvague (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vagueness)\n]\nJinan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan)\nstyle, made up of dishes from Jinan,\nDezhou (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dezhou)\n,\nTai'an (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai%27an)\nand the surrounding regions. One of its features is the use of soup.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_cuisine#cite_note-Travel-2)\nInfluence\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shandong_cuisine&action=edit&section=3)\n]\nAlthough less available in overseas Chinese restaurants, Shandong cuisine is considered one of the most influential schools in Chinese cuisine.\n[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_cuisine#cite_note-Imperial-3)\nModern cuisines in\nNorth China (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China)\n(\nBeijing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_cuisine)\n,\nTianjin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin_cuisine)\nand the\nManchuria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_China)\n) are branches of Shandong cuisine, and meals in most Northern Chinese households are typically prepared using simplified Shandong methods.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_cuisine#cite_note-Travel-2)\nDuring the\nSpring and Autumn period (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_period)\n(770-221 BCE), there were 2 influential states,\nQi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(state))\nand\nLu (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_(state))\n. Both states, with mountains and fertile plains, were economically and culturally developed and had abundant aquatic products, grains and sea salt. Some of the earliest known descriptions of Chinese culinary methods come from the states. Yi Ya, a retainer of\nDuke Huan of Qi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Huan_of_Qi)\n, was renowned for his culinary skill.\nConfucius (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius)\n(who was born in the Lu state) was quoted in the\nAnalects (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects)\nas saying, \"One should not indulge overly in fine flour, or in\nkuai\n(a dish akin to\ncarpaccio (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpaccio)\n) that is sliced too thinly\". About food, he recommended: \"Do not consume food which looks spoiled, smells spoiled, is out of season, is improperly butchered, or is not made with its proper seasoning\".\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nThe cuisine as it is known today was created during the\nYuan dynasty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty)\n. It gradually spread to northern and northeastern China. In Beijing and Tianjin, it influenced\nImperial cuisine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Imperial_cuisine)\n. Shandong cuisine is primarily made up of\nJiaodong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_Peninsula)\nand\nJinan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan)\ndishes.\n[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_cuisine#cite_note-Imperial-3)\nIngredients\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shandong_cuisine&action=edit&section=4)\n]\nAlthough modern transportation has increased the availability of ingredients throughout China, Shandong cuisine remains rooted in tradition. It is noted for its variety of\nseafood (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood)\n, including\nscallop (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scallop)\n,\nprawn and shrimp (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp_and_prawn_as_food)\n,\nclam (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clam)\n,\nsea cucumber (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_cucumbers_as_food)\nand\nsquid (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_as_food)\n.\nMaize\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shandong_cuisine&action=edit&section=5)\n]\nShandong is unique for its use of\nmaize (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize)\n, a local\ncash crop (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_crop)\nnot widely cultivated in northern China. Unlike the\nsweet corn (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_corn)\nof North America, Shandong maize is chewy and starchy, and often has a grassy aroma. It is served as steamed (or boiled) cobs, or the kernels are removed from the cob and lightly fried.\nPeanuts\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shandong_cuisine&action=edit&section=6)\n]\nShandong is noted for its peanuts, which are fragrant and naturally sweet. Large dishes of peanuts (roasted in the shell or shelled and stir-fried with salt) are common at meals, and they are served raw in a number of cold dishes from the region.\nGrains\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shandong_cuisine&action=edit&section=7)\n]\nShandong uses a variety of small grains. Millet, wheat, oats and barley can be found in the local diet, often eaten as\ncongee (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congee)\nor milled and cooked into a variety of steamed and fried breads. People in Shandong tend to prefer steamed breads rather than rice as a staple food.\nStaple vegetables\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shandong_cuisine&action=edit&section=8)\n]\nDespite its agricultural output, Shandong has not traditionally used the variety of vegetables seen in southern Chinese cooking. Potatoes, tomatoes, cabbages, mushrooms, onions, garlic and eggplant are staple vegetables, with grassy greens, sea grasses and bell peppers also common. The large, sweet cabbages grown in central Shandong are known for their delicate flavour and hardiness; a staple of the winter diet in much of the province, they appear in many dishes.\n[4] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_cuisine#cite_note-4)\nVinegar\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shandong_cuisine&action=edit&section=9)\n]\nShandong's greatest contribution to Chinese cuisine is arguably its vinegar. Hundreds of years of experience and unique local methods have led to the region's prominence in Chinese vinegar production. Unlike the lighter, sharper types of vinegar popular in the south, Shandong vinegar has a complexity which some consider fine enough to stand alone.\n[5] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_cuisine#cite_note-5)\nSome well-known dishes in Shandong cuisine\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Baochao_yaohua_2009_03.jpg)\nStir-fried pig's kidney (\n爆 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%88%86)\n炒 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%82%92)\n腰 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%85%B0)\n花 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%8A%B1)\n;\nbàochǎoyāohuā\n)\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jiuqu_dachang_2009_03.jpg)\nPig's large intestine (\n九 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B9%9D)\n曲 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9B%B2)\n大 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7)\n肠 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%82%A0)\n;\n九 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B9%9D)\n曲 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9B%B2)\n大 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7)\n腸 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%85%B8)\n;\njiǔqū dàcháng\n; 'nine-coiled large intestine')\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Basi_digua_2009_03.jpg)\nSweet potato with caramelised sugar (\n拔 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%8B%94)\n丝 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%9D)\n地 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%9C%B0)\n瓜 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%93%9C)\n;\n拔 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%8B%94)\n絲 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%B5%B2)\n地 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%9C%B0)\n瓜 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%93%9C)\n;\nbásī dìguā\n; 'pull-out silk sweet potato')\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deepfried_cicada.jpg)\nDeep-fried golden\ncicada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada)\n(\n炸 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%82%B8)\n金 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%87%91)\n蝉 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%9D%89)\n;\n炸 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%82%B8)\n金 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%87%91)\n蟬 (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%9F%AC)\n;\nzhájīnchán\nSubgroups of Shandong cuisine\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shandong_cuisine&action=edit&section=10)\n]\nJinan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan)\ncuisine (\n济南菜\n;\n濟南菜\n;\nJìnán cài\n): The cooking methods of Jinan cuisine focus on quick frying, roasting and boiling.

The Jiaodong area is located close to the sea, so most raw materials are seafood. Sea cucumber, abalone and scallop are common in this area.

The Kong family have high standards for the quality of every dish. Therefore, for every dish, Kongfu style emphasizes rigorous slicing skills during preparation and elegance when served.\nLuxinan cuisine (\n鲁西南菜\n;\n魯西南菜\n;\nLǔ xīnán cài\n): \"Luxinan\" refers to southwestern parts of Shandong Province.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing)\n. Chongqing was formerly a part of Sichuan until 1997; thus, there is a great deal of cultural overlap between the two administrative divisions. There are many regional, local variations of Sichuanese cuisine within Sichuan and Chongqing.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-2)\nIt is renowned for fiery and bold tastes, particularly the pungency and spiciness resulting from liberal use of\ngarlic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic)\nand\nchilis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper)\n, as well as the unique flavors of\nSichuan (Szechuan) pepper (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_pepper)\n. Some examples are\nKung Pao chicken (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Pao_chicken)\nand\nYuxiang shredded pork (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuxiang_shredded_pork)\n. Four substyles of Sichuan cuisine include Chongqing,\nChengdu (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu)\n,\nZigong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigong)\n(known for a genre of dishes called\nyanbangcai (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanbangcai)\n), and\nBuddhist vegetarian (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_vegetarianism)\nstyle.\n[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDunlop2003[httpsarchiveorgdetailslandofplentytrea00dunl_23-24]-3)\nUNESCO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO)\ndeclared Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, a\ncity of gastronomy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Gastronomy)\nin 2011.\n[4] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-4)\nHistory\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sichuan_cuisine&action=edit&section=1)\n]\nIn the\nMiddle Ages (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages)\n, Sichuan welcomed\nMiddle Eastern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern)\ncrops, such as\nbroad beans (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_beans)\n,\nsesame (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame)\nand\nwalnuts (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnuts)\n. Since the 16th century, the list of major crops in Sichuan has even been lengthened by\nNew World (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World)\nnewcomers. The characteristic chili pepper originally came from\nMexico (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico)\nbut probably overland from\nIndia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)\nor by river from\nMacau (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau)\n, complementing the traditional\nSichuan (Szechuan) peppercorns (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_peppercorn)\n. Other newcomers from the New World included corn, which largely replaced\nmillet (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet)\n; white potatoes introduced by\nCatholic missions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_missions)\n; and sweet potatoes. The population of Sichuan was cut by perhaps three-quarters in the wars from the\nMing dynasty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty)\nto the\nQing dynasty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty)\n. Settlers from the adjacent\nHunan Province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan)\nbrought their cooking styles with them.\n[5] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-Anderson-5)\nSichuan is colloquially known as the \"heavenly country\" due to its abundance of food and natural resources. One ancient Chinese account declared that the \"people of Sichuan uphold good flavors, and they are fond of hot and spicy taste.\" Most Sichuan dishes are spicy, although a typical meal includes nonspicy dishes to cool the palate. Sichuan cuisine is composed of seven basic tastes: sweet, sour, numbingly spicy, spicy, bitter, fragrant/aromatic, and salty. Sichuan food is divided into five different types: sumptuous banquet, ordinary banquet, popular foods, household-style food and snacks. Milder versions of Sichuan dishes remain a staple of\nAmerican Chinese cuisine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Chinese_cuisine)\n.\n[6] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-sz-6)\n[7] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-7)\nThe superior natural resources of\nSichuan Province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan)\nprovided plenty natural resources for the development of cooking. The flow of the\nYangtze river (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze)\nthrough Sichuan Province provided nutrients for fundamental foods, spices, and a source of water.\n[8] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-8)\nCategory\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sichuan_cuisine&action=edit&section=2)\n]\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg)\nThis section\nmay need to be rewritten\nto comply with Wikipedia's\nquality standards (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style)\n.\nYou can help (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sichuan_cuisine&action=edit)\n.

Its characteristics are friendly and peaceful, rich in seasoning, relatively light taste, multi-traditional dishes;\n[9] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-9)\nUsing spicy bean paste and sugar for flavoring, it is the most widely circulated Sichuan cuisine. Shanghe Bangchuan cuisine is based on traditional classical recipes. It has a mild taste and a long flavor. At the same time, it concentrates on premium government dishes such as royal and official dishes. Delicate and delicate, most of them are traditional Sichuan cuisine that has been handed down for a long time, and it has always been the official cuisine of Sichuan Governor and General Yamen. The overall taste of Shanghe Bang cuisine is rather mild.\n[10] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-10)\n[11] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-11)\nXiaohe Bangchuan cuisine is salt gang cuisine centered on Zigong in southern Sichuan, including Yibin cuisine, Luzhou cuisine and Neijiang cuisine, which are characterized by thick taste, heavy taste and rich taste. Characterized by atmospheric, weird, high-end (the reason is salt merchants). Zigong Yanbang dishes are divided into three branches: salt commercial dishes, salt industrial dishes and hall dishes, with spicy taste, Mala taste and sweet and sour taste as three main categories.\n[12] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-12)\nYanbang dishes are characterized by rich, distinctive and rich taste. The most important thing to pay attention to is the taste of the food.\n[13] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-13)\nXiahe Bangchuan cuisine is represented by Dazhou cuisine, Chongqing cuisine and Wanzhou cuisine. Together, they form the three main schools of Sichuan cuisine, representing the highest artistic level of Sichuan cuisine development.\n[14] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-14)\nTherefore, Sichuan cuisine has three characteristics: extensive ingredients, diversified flavoring, and strong adaptability to cuisine. It consists of five major categories: banquet dishes, popular side dishes, home-cooked dishes, SanZhengJiuKou dishes,\n[15] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-15)\nflavor snacks and so on to form a complete flavor system.\n[16] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-16)\nOrigin theories\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sichuan_cuisine&action=edit&section=3)\n]\nScholars have proposed different theories regarding the division of Sichuan cuisine regions. Wang Dayu introduced in the compilation of Sichuan cuisine history strategy by the Committee on Literature and History of the CPPCC in the whole country: Sichuan cuisine can be roughly divided into Chengdu Bang, Chongqing Bang, Dahe Bang, Xiaohe Bang, from the inside, each has its own special background and representative menu.\n[17] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-17)\nSichuan cuisine originated in Shu during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, the beginning of Qin and Han dynasties, and the formation of classical Sichuan cuisine in Han and Jin dynasties. Characterized by Sichuan peppercorn and ginger. In the Tang and Song Dynasties, Sichuan cuisine was developed further, and Sichuan restaurants spread throughout Kaifeng and Lin'an, and won the favor of many diners for their taste characteristics. During the Song dynasty, Sichuan cuisine became an independent cuisine.\nSichuan is rich in products, and natural crops provide abundant raw materials for Sichuan cuisine. Among them, ginger, Sichuan pepper and other seasonings, as early as the Han dynasty, as Sichuan people \"like the flavor of spices\" characteristics known throughout the country. The taste of Sichuan people today is far from that of\nLi Bai (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Bai)\nand\nSu Shi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Shi)\n. If there were no chili peppers from South America in the Ming and Qing dynasties, it would not be Sichuan cuisine for Sichuan people today. Sichuan cuisine claims to have a history of more than two thousand years. However, it is difficult to say how much Sichuan cuisine is related to ancient Sichuan cuisine. One hard evidence is that before the\nMing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty)\nand\nQing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty)\ndynasties, there were no chili peppers in Sichuan cuisine. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Sichuan cuisine developed further until the Republic of China. Modern Sichuan cuisine eventually formed the characteristics of \"rich variety\", \"strong taste and spicy\", and developed into the first dish of Chinese cuisine.\nChairman Mao (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong)\nonce said on January 30, 1949, \"I believe that a\nChinese medicine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine)\n, a Chinese dish, will be China's two major contributions to the world.\" This evaluation was repeated in 1953 when he took a nap at the Liuzhuang Hotel in Hangzhou.\nChengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, was awarded the honorary title of \"World Cuisine Capital\" by UNESCO in 2010, and only six cities in the world received it. Chengdu Sichuan cuisine has long been the official cuisine of Sichuan Governor and Yamen. Chili peppers were introduced into Sichuan and widely used in Sichuan cuisine, which was a watershed between ancient Sichuan cuisine and modern Sichuan cuisine. Probably during the Kangxi period in the early Qing dynasty. The book \"Flower Mirror\" written and published by Chen Xiuzi in 1688, Kangxi, is recorded in volume five: \"Pepper, a sea mad vine, commonly known as spicy eggplant……the most spicy, used by many people, very fine, winter moon to replace pepper. \"Here the paprika, is chili, also known as sea pepper, Qin pepper and so on. The perfect combination of chili peppers and broad beans (i.e., beans) created Sichuan bean, known as the soul of Sichuan cuisine, is widely used in Sichuan cuisine. Peanuts are the most famous of the many varieties of Sichuan Beans. Pixian's is most renowned among the many varieties of Sichuan spicy bean paste. The innovative use of pickled peppers, pickle and black bean sauce in Sichuan cuisine has formed 24 common flavors, 54 cooking methods and more than 3,000 classic traditional dishes in three categories of Sichuan cuisine, which are the hallmarks of modern Sichuan cuisine.\nNative to Peru in South America, chili peppers were domesticated as cultivated species in Mexico, introduced to Europe in the 15th century, and introduced from the sea to China in the late 16th century, the late Ming dynasty. Because of the introduction of Western countries, it is also called \" Fan pepper\".

Pork is overwhelmingly the most common type of meat consumed.\n[5] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-Anderson-5)\nBeef is somewhat more common in Sichuan cuisine than it is in other Chinese cuisines, perhaps due to the prevalence of oxen in the region.\n[18] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine#cite_note-18)\nSichuan cuisine also uses various\nbovine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine)\nand\nporcine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcine)\norgans as ingredients, such as intestine, arteries, head, tongue, skin and liver, in addition to other commonly used portions of the meat.\nRabbit meat (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_meat)\nis also much more popular in Sichuan than elsewhere in China.

Hearty, wholesome and delicious, it is easy to cook up and easily becomes a family favourite. Enjoy juicy, tender chicken and butter-soft potatoes soaked in a thick, tasty umami gravy over steamed rice._\n\nI was poring through my older posts and this **tender braised chicken with potatoes** is a hot favourite, even today. But I have to admit, guys, I almost cringed at the photos I took back then!\n\nThere were so many things wrong with the photos, I didn’t know where to start! Tone, composition, lighting, staging, basically the whole nine yards just _ughhh_! Goodness, I really didn’t do this dish any justice!\n\nFinally, I’m putting things right. This [circuit breaker](https://www.timeout.com/singapore/things-to-do/things-you-need-to-know-about-singapores-circuit-breaker-measures) we’re into might just have given me the opportunity and time to rejuvenate some of my oldest recipes.\n\nYup, finally throwing a little bit of love and attention wherever I can. So, let’s take a new look, and I mean this literally, at this amazing dish of Chinese-style braised chicken with potatoes!\n\n![Image 1: Chinese-Style Tender Braised Chicken with Potatoes](blob:http://localhost/77696830d579faf78ab8e4b0bbfbe6ef)\n\nLet me just say this. I am such a fan of gravy and sauces that I often look to Cantonese food for a lot of inspiration in my cooking.\n\nAll is well because my hubby and I both happen to love Cantonese cuisine. So in that way, our palettes are congruent which makes my task of preparing our family meals so much easier.\n\nAbout Cantonese braised chicken\n-------------------------------\n\nNow, you probably have some impression of how famous the Cantonese are for their food. Travel to Hong Kong, and nearby Guangzhou, and you’ll be totally wowed by the amazing and tantalising smorgasboard of Canton cuisine.\n\nNot only for preparing elegant and exquisite dishes fit for banquets and feasts, but also for a great variety of simple, hearty home-cooked meals. And this braised chicken with potatoes is one such homey dish.\n\n![Image 2: Tender braised chicken with potatoes](blob:http://localhost/c08f08fb29c8f26e9b89ad3de8583b61)\n\nEvery Chinese family has their cherished recipes for braised chicken. In fact, you won’t usually find this on a typical Chinese restaurant menu. That’s why we treasure the instances, and memories of when our mothers cooked this for us with love and dedication.\n\nNow, this chicken with potatoes dish has delicate but distinct flavours. How it tastes is ultimately defined by the combination of seasonings used.\n\nHowever, it’s easy to go overboard with seasonings, especially the sauces and that’s not ideal. Otherwise, the whole dish will lose the little nuances of flavour and will taste overwhelmingly of the sauce.\n\nIngredients for the dish\n------------------------\n\nThe great thing about this is that it takes a pretty short list of ingredients to cook up this hearty wholesome dish. You’re likely to have all of this in your pantry right now. So here’s what we will need:\n\n![Image 3: Tender braised chicken with potatoes](blob:http://localhost/c08f08fb29c8f26e9b89ad3de8583b61)\n\n*   **chicken**\n*   **potatoes**\n*   **ginger**\n*   **garlic**\n*   **spring onions**\n*   **Asian sauces** – oyster sauce, light soy sauce and dark soy sauce\n*   **Chinese wine**\n*   **sesame oil**\n\n### Tips on chicken cuts and potato variety\n\n*   **Choose the mix of chicken cuts you like**. My favourite options for braising are either _a whole chicken cut up_, or tastier cuts like _chicken thighs_, _drumsticks_, and of course, _chicken wings_. Who doesn’t love wings, right?\n*   **Skin-on is more tasty than skin off**.If you want more flavour, skin-on chicken parts are better as the oils will infuse with the braising sauce. \n*   **Granola potatoes** are, in my humble opinion, the best variety to use for braising. But, basically any waxy white or yellow potatoes that hold their shape well when boiled. Other suitable options are _**Yukon Gold**_ and _**Fingerling**_ potatoes.\n\nThese are just my suggestions, of course and nothing should stop you from enjoying this dish with the chicken cuts and potatoes you love to eat. So, if you’re all for skinless breast meat and potatoes mashed and literally dissolved in your gravy, then enjoy!\n\n![Image 4: Tender braised chicken with potatoes](blob:http://localhost/c08f08fb29c8f26e9b89ad3de8583b61)\n\nStep-by-step cooking: braised chicken with potatoes\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore we even fire up the stove, go ahead and marinate the chicken with the seasonings. The meat has to sit for at least an hour. Preferably, if you’re planning to cook ahead, an overnight marinate in the chiller would be even better.\n\n*   **Step 1: Deep-fry potatoes until lightly browned**. Heat up 1/2 cup of oil in a wok or skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is very hot, deep fry the potato chunks until they turn light brown. Turn over the potatoes as needed to brown all sides evenly. When done, remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n\n*   **Step 2: Fry the aromatics and chicken**. Scoop out the oil, leaving behind 3 tbsp. When the oil is hot again, fry the aromatics (ginger and spring onions) over high heat until fragrant. \n\n*   **Step 3: Add the whole garlic cloves**, and toss for 30 seconds.\n\n*   **Steps 4 & 5: Put in the seasoned chicken**. Sear over high heat till lightly browned**.**\n\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/c425303b0eed4fd9ed506c95372dd7e1)![Image 6](blob:http://localhost/c425303b0eed4fd9ed506c95372dd7e1)![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/c425303b0eed4fd9ed506c95372dd7e1)![Image 8](blob:http://localhost/c425303b0eed4fd9ed506c95372dd7e1)![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/c425303b0eed4fd9ed506c95372dd7e1)![Image 10](blob:http://localhost/c425303b0eed4fd9ed506c95372dd7e1)![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/c425303b0eed4fd9ed506c95372dd7e1)![Image 12](blob:http://localhost/3ae4d04f916712e5394829daa66ef1f5)\n*   **Step 6: Add water and let braise.** There should be enough water to just cover the chicken. Let the mixture come to a boil, then reduce the heat until a gentle simmer. Let braise, uncovered, for 30 minutes.\n\n*   **Step 7: Put in fried potatoes**. Halfway through the braising, stir in the fried potato chunks. If the water has reduced too quickly, add more water as needed to braise the potatoes. Stir occasionally, but be careful not to break up the potatoes.\n\n*   **Step 8: Braise until meat is tender and reduce to thicken gravy.** Once the meat is tender to your liking, taste the gravy and season to your tastes. If you love your gravy thick, simmer to further reduce but bear in mind, the flavours will intensify. So if it was just salty enough, it will taste saltier if you reduce further. Alternatively, you can also thicken the gravy by thickening with corn starch solution.\n\n#### Here are more braised chicken recipes to inspire your next meal:\n\n*   [Brasied Chicken with Mushrooms and Chinese Sausage](https://www.foodelicacy.com/braised-chicken-with-mushrooms-and-chinese-sausages/)\n*   [Braised Chicken in Oyster Sauce](https://www.foodelicacy.com/braised-chicken-in-oyster-sauce/)\n*   [Chicken in Spicy Tomato Sauce (Ayam Masak Merah)](https://www.foodelicacy.com/chicken-in-spicy-tomato-sauce/)\n*   [Soy Sauce Chicken](https://www.foodelicacy.com/soy-sauce-chicken/)\n*   [Three Cup Chicken – Tasty Treasure of Taiwan](https://www.foodelicacy.com/three-cup-chicken/)\n\nBraised Chicken with Potatoes\n-----------------------------\n\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/2397d1366f84c41288c148c7050a4723)](https://www.foodelicacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/chicken-with-potatoes-2A-scaled.jpg)\n\n4.7 from 37 reviews\n\nThis is a quintessential Chinese comfort dish of braised chicken with potatoes.
