The very mention of hustling sets our teeth on edge, and if you bring up revenue streams and project rates, we’re just about ready to run out the door. Erica Machulak’s new book, Hustles for Humanists, seeks to dispel that discomfort and prove to us that entrepreneurship is not only a viable potential career alternative, but one that many of us are doing already.I sat down with Dr. Machulak to ask her advice for taking the first steps into freelancing, balancing entrepreneurship and graduate work, and setting expectations with clients. Our conversation has been edited for concision and clarity.\n\n![Image 22: Berkeley graduate student in a hat and sunglasses giving thumbs up](https://grad.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/20240904_Gradstravaganza_bhs_015-scaled-1.jpg)\n\nMay 12, 2025\n\n### [Eight Steps to a Successful Summer Break](https://grad.berkeley.edu/news/eight-steps-to-a-successful-summer-break/)\n\nSummer is often seen as a season of endless possibilities, offering a chance for graduate students to make progress on their research, catch up on tasks, and enjoy a break. At the same time, it can also be a time of uncertainty and anxiety, especially when it comes to the pressure to be productive without the usual structure of the academic year. Balancing the opportunities and challenges of summer can be a delicate task, but with some careful planning and thoughtful strategies, you can make the most of your break.\n",

Cookies the University sets are called first-party Cookies. The data collected might be about you, your device, your preferences, or your login information. This data is mostly used to make the website work as expected so, for example, you don’t have to keep re-entering your credentials whenever you come back to the site. Cookies set by third parties are called third-party Cookies. We use third-party Cookies for analyzing website traffic and our advertising and marketing efforts. We have divided the Cookies we use into the following categories: Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functional, and Targeting. Under each category heading below you will find a general description of the Cookies in each category. You can change your browser settings to block, delete, or alert you to Cookies. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to do that. However, if you do, you may have to manually adjust preferences every time you visit a site and some features may not work as intended.\n\nSee the [**University of Illinois System Cookie Policy**Link opens in a new window](https://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/resources/cookies) for more information.\n\n Strictly Necessary Cookies - Always Active \nStrictly Necessary Cookies are first-party Cookies that are necessary for the website to function. They can be either permanent or temporary and are usually only set in response to actions made directly by you that amount to a request for services, such as logging in or filling in forms. For example, we use Strictly Necessary Cookies to handle user registration and login. Some sites require the use of Strictly Necessary Cookies to access the site, such as University websites requiring University credentialed authentication. If you set your browser to block or delete Cookies, you may not be able to access the site or some parts of the site will not work.\n\n Performance Cookies - Always Active \nPerformance Cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance and effectiveness of University websites. Performance Cookies also help the University understand which webpages are the most and least popular, see how visitors move around the site, and determine whether webpage content is relevant to user interests. Performance Cookies may be first-party or third party, permanent or temporary, and do not personally identify individual visitors. Some Performance Cookies are “analytics” Cookies (e.g., Google Analytics), using third-party software tools, which help us understand more about how our websites are used and where visitors come from by collecting and aggregating anonymous information on the pages visited and any advertisements viewed. The University does not take responsibility for the collection, use, and management of data by any third-party software tool provider unless required to do so by applicable law. If you set your browser to block or delete Cookies, some site services and functionalities may not work.\n\n Functional Cookies - Always Active \nFunctional Cookies enhance the performance and functionality of our websites but are non-essential to their use. These permanent Cookies allow our website to remember information from your previous visits, such as details you submitted before or your previously stated preferences. These Cookies may also be used to provide services you request, such as newsletters or publications. They may be first- or third-party Cookies that enable services we have added to our webpages. If you set your browser to block or delete Cookies, some or all of these services may not function properly.\n\n Targeting Cookies - Always Active \nTargeting Cookies are used to deliver content tailored to your interests and may be temporary or permanent. They may also be first-party or third-party Cookies. Targeting Cookies are based on uniquely identifying your browser and device; they do not store information such as your name. The University may use targeting Cookies prepared by the University, its third-party contractors, or advertising partners to provide you with personalized University display advertising and promotional material about the University and its programs. The University may also allow third parties to place Cookies on your device that collect and use anonymous information about your visits to, and interactions with, our websites to personalize advertisements and promotional materials for University goods and services. Targeting Cookies may be used by our third-party contractors or our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. We may share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising, and analytics partners who may combine it with other information that you have provided to them or that they have collected from your use of their services. If you set your browser to block or delete Cookies, you will still see advertisements, but they will be less targeted to your interests.\n\n Close\n",

Our vision is that CMU will meet the changing needs of society by building on its traditions of innovation, problem solving and interdisciplinarity. From the arts to technology, humanities and the sciences, we reach across boundaries to bring together bright minds to move us forward locally, nationally and globally with creative solutions to worldwide challenges.\n\nCMU is home to master’s and doctoral programs within our seven schools and colleges, which are [ranked among the top in the country](https://www.cmu.edu/about/cmu_fact_sheet_02.pdf).CMU also offers [online programs](https://www.cmu.edu/online/) and dozens of [interdisciplinary programs](https://www.cmu.edu/academics/interdisciplinary-programs.html). In addition, CMU is a [global university](https://www.cmu.edu/global/) with more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships.\n\nTo learn more about the graduate programs offered at CMU, see the Guide to Graduate Degrees and Programs section, which provides a college-based list that will direct you to the college websites for detailed information. You are also encouraged to explore the information and resources throughout this website to learn more about the many facets of graduate study at CMU.\n\nAcademics\n---------\n\n![Image 1](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/prospective/images/academics-800.jpg)\n\nA cornerstone of our graduate education is research with a focus on advancing knowledge and finding meaningful solutions to significant problems of society. This real-world, hands-on approach has made CMU home to excellent faculty and students in engineering, computer science, the natural sciences, humanities and social sciences, business administration and the fine arts.\n\nThis philosophy has also been the basis for interdisciplinary study and research to an extent that is rarely found elsewhere. CMU houses a myriad of interdisciplinary research facilities that combine expertise in diverse fields to produce exciting new areas of exploration.\n\nOur commitment to diversity in our research and in supporting our diverse community truly makes CMU a unique place to carry out your graduate education. Whether students are looking for professional development opportunities, small project research grants or funding for conference attendance, CMU provides people, programs and resources for our students to succeed.\n\nAdmission and Application Process\n---------------------------------\n\nEach program manages their own separate admissions process, including deadlines and requirements, and this information varies by department. You are encouraged to visit the department's website in which you are interested to find specific details.\n\nA student’s qualifications are not assessed until a full application has been received and processed. To learn more about your eligibility and how to apply, visit the department’s website in which you are interested. Some departments provide a few guidelines regarding the level of competitiveness. If provided, this would be found on the department website.\n\nYou are welcome to apply to more than one program, but in most cases you will need to complete separate applications for each. It is recommended not to assume that you can submit the exact same materials for each and to look closely at each program’s application requirements. Moreover, many departments have a list of FAQs that will address common issues, so if you are having technical difficulties with the application, check the department website and if the problem is not addressed on the website, contact the department directly.\n\nCheck the department website for an admission notification timeline or contact a department administrator to find out when you can expect a response regarding admissions.\n\nAll admissions-related questions, including where to submit transcripts, exam requirements, and how to set up a visit, should be directed to the department in which you are interested by visiting the college/school website linked in the Guide to Graduate Degrees and Programs section.\n\n![Image 2](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/prospective/images/admissions-800.jpg)\n\nTuition and Financial Support\n-----------------------------\n\n![Image 3](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/prospective/images/mcs-800.jpg)\n\nFor the most part, students in the master's programs are self-supporting, and Ph.D. students are at least partially funded and encouraged to apply to fellowships. Each program makes their own arrangements regarding financial support of potential graduate students. Applicants should seek information from the department of interest for their specific opportunities.\n\nMore information regarding tuition and fees can be found on the [Student Financial Services website](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/tuition/index.html).\n\nVisit the [Funding Opportunities and Fellowships page](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/funding/index.html) to learn more about the centralized programs and resources that are in place for graduate student conference funding, small project research grants, professional engagement funding, and fellowship and scholarship opportunities, including the [CMU Rales Fellows Program](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/funding/rales/index.html).\n\nGuide to Graduate Degrees and Programs\n--------------------------------------\n\n![Image 4](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/prospective/images/graduation-800.jpg)\n",

The Graduate Deans and Graduate Studies Office staff work closely with faculty and staff within the Graduate Options to monitor academic progress, advise students with diverse needs, and administer a wide range of financial support for graduate students, including internal and external fellowships, emergency funds, parent support funds, and dependent health care reimbursements. We also work closely with the [Graduate Student Council](https://gsc.caltech.edu/) and the various [Student Affairs](http://studentaffairs.caltech.edu/) offices to address student needs and to ensure that students from all backgrounds can thrive in our vibrant research and teaching community.\n\nThe office is staffed by dean, David C. Chan; associate dean, Darrell Peterson; assistant dean, Natalie Gilmore; operations and admissions administrator, Helen Duong; senior financial analyst, Claudia Andrade; and administrative assistant, Georgine Okura.\n\nWe encourage students to seek the support of the Graduate Studies Office when needed, regardless of the issue. We invite all graduate students to visit our office at the Center for Student Services and learn more about the services we offer.\n\n[**Message from the Dean**](https://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/dean)\n\n### Meet Our Team [](https://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/#meet-our-team \"Right-click here and choose \\\"Copy Link\\\" to get a link to this part of the page.\")\n\n[![Image 58: people](https://caltechsites-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gradoffice/images/David_Chan.2e16d0ba.fill-322x250-c100.jpg) David C.
