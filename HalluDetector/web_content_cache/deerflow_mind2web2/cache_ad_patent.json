comprising a positioning member 1 , a ball joint 2 , an overhead shower head 3 and a control mechanism 4 .\n*   the positioning member 1 is fixedly installed on the wall.\n*   the positioning member 1 has a water supply passage a communicating with a water supply end.\n*   the ball joint 2 is installed at an outlet end of the water supply passage a.\n*   the overhead shower head 3 includes a handle portion 31 protruding from the surface of the overhead shower head 3 for the user to operate and adjust the angle of the overhead shower head 3 .\n*   the control mechanism 4 is disposed on the handle portion 31 and configured to control the inlet end of the overhead shower head 3 to be in communication with an outlet end of the overhead shower head 3 .\n*   the water supply end refers to the water pipe pre-buried in the wall.\n*   the positioning member 1 includes a positioning seat 11 fixedly connected to the wall and a water supply pipe 12 connected to the positioning seat 11 .\n*   the water supply passage a is defined in the water supply pipe 12 .\n*   the ball joint 2 is threadedly connected to an outlet end of the water supply pipe 12 .\n*   the inlet end of the overhead shower head 3 refers to the end communicating with the ball joint 2 .\n*   the outlet end of the overhead shower head 3 refers to the front panel of the overhead shower head 3 .\n*   the inlet end and the outlet end of the overhead shower head 3 are disposed on the upper and lower surfaces of the overhead shower head 3 , respectively.\n*   the handle portion 31 is disposed on the peripheral surface of the overhead shower head 3 .\n*   the overhead shower head 3 has an inlet passage b and an outlet passage c therein. Two ends of the inlet passage b are in communication with the inlet end of the overhead shower head 3 and an inlet end of the control mechanism 4 , respectively.\n*   Two ends of the outlet passage c are in communication with the outlet end of the overhead shower head 3 and an outlet end of the control mechanism 4 , respectively.\n*   the water first flows to the control mechanism 4 of the handle portion 31 , and the control mechanism 4 controls the opening and closing of the water passage or the distribution of the water passage. After that, the water flows to the outlet passage c, and is sprayed out from the front panel of the overhead shower head 3 .\n*   the control mechanism 4 is located on the handle portion 31 of the overhead shower head 3 . It is convenient for the user to operate the control mechanism 4 to turn on/off or switch the water passages.\n*   the handle portion 31 is a hollow structure. Both the inlet passage b and the outlet passage c are in communication with the control mechanism 4 through water pipes 6 .

Field of the Invention*   [0001] \nThe present invention relates to an overhead shower head, and more particularly, to a shower system having an operating handle.\n\n2. Description of the Prior Art*   [0002] \nShower heads usually include hand-held shower heads and overhead shower heads. Because the overhead shower head is usually higher than the user's head and the spray area of the overhead shower head is larger, it is widely used in houses, hotels and other places. The overhead shower head is generally installed on the top of a shower rod through a ball joint, so as to adjust the angle of the overhead shower head for taking a shower. However, the installation height of most overhead shower heads is fixed, which makes it difficult for some shorter users to adjust the angle of the overhead shower head.\n\n*   [0003] In order to solve the above problem, an electronically-controlled or mechanically-controlled adjustment mechanism is provided between the lower end of the shower rod and the overhead shower head.

The\n\n[[steel rope](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240123456A1 \"Show image containing callout\")](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240123456A1 \"Show image containing callout\")\n**6** is pulled by the driven bevel gear rotating shaft meshed on the outside to adjust the position on the outside of the driven bevel gear rotating shaft, and the rotating ring is pulled to control and adjust the rotation of the\n\n[[overhead shower head](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240123456A1 \"Show image containing callout\")](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240123456A1 \"Show image containing callout\")\n**8**, thereby changing the angle of the overhead shower head to spray water. In practical applications, the above-mentioned patent has the problems of complex structure, troublesome disassembly and assembly, and high cost. Because the overhead shower head is used in humid environments, such as bathrooms, the metal parts in the adjustment mechanism are prone to rust, resulting in poor operating feel of the product after a long period of use. \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION*   [0004] \nThe primary object of the present invention is to provide a shower system having an operating handle.

A computing device may receive a request for assistance from a vehicle operating in an environment. The request indicates that the vehicle is stopped at a location with a sensor perspective of the environment that is at least partially occluded. Responsive to receiving the request for assistance, the computing device may display a graphical user interface (GUI) that represents a current state of the vehicle and includes a selectable option configured to enable the vehicle to gradually move forward a predefined distance. The computing device may detect a selection of the selectable option and transmit instructions that enable the vehicle to gradually move forward the predefined distance. The vehicle can then gradually move forward the predefined distance while also monitoring for one or more changes in the environment responsive to receiving the instructions.\n\n**Type:** Application\n\n**Filed:** June 27, 2023\n\n**Publication date:** November 2, 2023\n\n**Inventors:** Ioan-Alexandru Sucan, Collin Winter, Chien-Yu Ko, Vishay Nihalani \n*   ###### [EXCEPTION HANDLING FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20230305577)\n\n**Publication number:** 20230305577\n\n**Abstract:** Aspects of the technology relate to exception handling for a vehicle. For instance, a current trajectory for the vehicle and sensor data corresponding to one or more objects may be received. Based on the received sensor data, projected trajectories of the one or more objects may be determined. Potential collisions with the one or more objects may be determined based on the projected trajectories and the current trajectory. One of the potential collisions that is earliest in time may be identified. Based on the one of the potential collisions, a safety-time-horizon (STH) may be identified.

To access publicly available documents, guest users may access Patent Center.\n\n[Patent Center](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/#!/)\n\n### Update bookmarks and favorites from Public Pair to Patent Center\n\n1.   Remove Public PAIR at [https://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair](https://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair)from your bookmarks and favorites.\n2.   Create new bookmarks to Patent Center at[https://patentcenter.uspto.gov](http://patentcenter.uspto.gov/).\n3.   For new system information see the[Patent Center User Guide](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Patent_Center_User_Guide_Dec.pdf)or visit the [Patent Center Information page](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/apply/patent-center).\n4.   For valid format types to access documents see the [Patent Center Quick Reference Guide](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Patent_Center_public_doc_access.pdf).\n5.   To prepare for the transition, we are hosting several training sessions to provide details and answer questions. Please register at: [Accessing publicly available documents training using Patent Center](https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/events/patent-center).\n\nFor assistance, contact the Patent Electronic Business Center (EBC) at 866-217-9197 during their operating hours of 6 a.m. to midnight ET, Monday - Friday, or email[ebc@uspto.gov](mailto:ebc@uspto.gov).\n\n### Access information for Patent Center\n\n*   A verified account enables users to view their pending patent applications and to file follow on submissions.\n*   Practitioners and independent inventors require a verified USPTO.gov account to access [Patent Center](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/#!/).\n*   Obtain a verified USPTO.gov account using the[verification process](https://portal.uspto.gov/patents/apply/applying-online/getting-started-new-users \"Getting started: Patent Center new users\").\n\n### Frequently asked questions\n\nWhy is Public PAIR being retired?\n\nPublic PAIR is a decades old tool, and is being replaced by Patent Center, the Next Generation Patent filing and retrieval system.Patent Center provides all Public PAIR functionality, including access to publicly available patent documents by application, patent, Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), publication, and/or international design registration numbers. Users are also able to sort documents and transaction history based on column headings.\n\nWhen will Private PAIR be retired?\n\nWe are considering retiring all our legacy systems in favor of more modern tools. We do not have specific plans to retire Private PAIR at this time, but we will continue to update stakeholders as we develop our systems and our timeline.\n\nWhat is Patent Center?\n\nPatent Center is the Next Generation Patent filing/retrieval and account management system. Patent Center enhances the user experience by incorporating filing, application and customer self-administration management within a single user interface. Visit the [Patent Center](https://portal.uspto.gov/patents/apply/patent-center) page or download the [Patent Center Quick Start Guide](https://portal.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Patent_Center_User_Guide_Dec.pdf) for more information.\n\nWhat types of applications will I be able to view in Patent Center?\n\nPatent Center will allow guest users to search any public:\n\n*   Patent applications, including provisionals\n*   Issued patents\n*   Design applications\n*   Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)\n*   International Design Registration\n*   Supplemental Reexamination\n*   Reexamination\n\nWhat happened to searching by Control Number?\n\nControl Number Search (Reexam) has been incorporated within Application search, which reduces the number of search selections.\n\nHow do I view or download Non-Patent-Literature in Patent Center?\n\nAs a “guest user”, downloading non-patent literature (NPL) is not allowed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nIs there a search format I should follow?\n\nEach application type has different allowable formats. If a valid number is entered in an invalid format, the system will display an error message with the valid format for that specific search type. The user can then reenter the application number using one of the valid formats in the displayed error message.\n\nIs there any restriction to what I can download from a search in Patent Center?\n\nNon-Patent Literature (NPL) documents are restricted from download and view due to Copyright restrictions.\n\nWhy are some applications that I type unavailable?\n\nIn order to access an application as a guest user, the application must be set to “public”. Applications that have a Publication number and Publication Date or a Patent number and Issue Date, the public can access. There are also complex business rules based on Parent/Child Continuity that can make an application public before publication.\n\nAre there other public search tools available?\n\nAlternative public search tools include:\n*   [Open Data Portal](https://data.uspto.gov/)\n*   [Patent Public Search](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/)\n\nHow can I search and download bulk data?\n\nYou can use [Open Data Portal](https://data.uspto.gov/) to search and download large sets of data.\n\nWill I be able to use the same account to log in to Patent Center as I use now for PAIR?\n\nYes, you will be able to use the same USPTO.gov account to access Patent Center, PAIR, EFS-Web, and Financial Manager. Guest users are not required to log in to Patent Center to search and file new applications.\n\nDo I need to be a registered user to search public applications?\n\nNo. Guest users can search available public applications.\n\nWhat is a “guest user”?\n\nA guest user is a user who accesses Patent Center without logging in with a registered or proofed MyUSPTO.gov account.\n\nWhat is a MyUSPTO.gov account?\n\nA MyUSPTO.gov account is when a user registers or links their email address with the USPTO. Visit [MyUSPTO](https://my.uspto.gov/) then select the “Create a USPTO.gov account” button. For assistance with creating a USPTO.gov account, contact the USPTO Contact Center (UCC) at 1-800-786-9199 or 571-272-1000 from 8:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Eastern Time. When prompted, choose option 3, then option 4 for USPTO.gov accounts.\n\nHow do I become a “proofed” user?\n\nVisit the “[Getting Started – New Users](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/apply/applying-online/getting-started-new-users)” page for instructions to become a proofed user. Contact the Patent Electronic Business Center (PEBC) for assistance at 1-866-217-9197 or 571-272-4100 from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday or email[EBC@uspto.gov](mailto:EBC@uspto.gov).\n\nWhat is the benefit to becoming a “proofed” user?\n\nWhen you use Patent Center as a guest user, your scope is limited to fewer filing options and accessing only public applications. As a proofed user, you will be able to view your pending applications(s) and file follow-on submissions.\n\n[_share_ Share this page](https://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair)[_print_ Print this page](https://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair)\n\n[Additional information](https://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair) about this page\n\n##### Additional information about this page\n\n**Last updated on:**Jul 15, 2025 10:23 AM EDT\n\n**Published on:**Jun 29, 2022 08:17 AM EDT\n\n**Owned by:**eCommerce\n\nClose\n\nReceive updates from the USPTO\n\nEnter your email to subscribe or update your preferences \n\nSubscribe\n\n[About the USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/about-us)[Search for patents](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/search)[Search for trademarks](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search)\n\n[US Department of Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/)\n\n[Accessibility](https://www.uspto.gov/using-usptogov/accessibility-uspto-website)\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.uspto.gov/privacy-policy)\n\n[Terms of Use](https://www.uspto.gov/terms-use-uspto-websites)\n\n[Financial and Performance Data](https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/financial-and-performance)\n\n[Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/security/vulnerability-disclosure-policy)\n\n[Freedom of Information Act](https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/ip-policy/electronic-freedom-information-act-e-foia)\n\n[Inspector General](https://www.oig.doc.gov/about/oversight-areas/u-s-patent-and-trademark-office-pto/)\n\n[NoFEAR Act](https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/nofear-act)\n\n[USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/)\n\n[USPTO - United States Patent and Trademark Office](https://www.uspto.gov/)\n\nFollow us[USPTO Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/uspto.gov)[USPTO Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/uspto)[USPTO Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/uspto)[USPTO X page](https://x.com/uspto)[USPTO Youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/USPTOvideo)\n\n[Back to top](https://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair#)\n",
