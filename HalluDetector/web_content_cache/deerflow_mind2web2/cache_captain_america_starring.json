Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing [Peter Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Parker_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\")'s attention. Maw, unable to take the Time Stone due to Strange's enchantment, captures him. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship while Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.\n\nThe [Guardians of the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") respond to the Asgardian ship's distress call and rescue Thor. Thor surmises that Thanos is after the Reality Stone, which [Taneleer Tivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taneleer_Tivan_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Taneleer Tivan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") possesses on [Knowhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowhere_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Knowhere (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\").

Thanos kidnaps Gamora, who discloses the Soul Stone's location to save [Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") from torture. On [Vormir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vormir_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Vormir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"), the Stone's keeper, [Red Skull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Skull_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Red Skull (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"), tells Thanos that he can only acquire it by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, earning the Stone.\n\nMidnight and Glaive ambush [Wanda Maximoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_Maximoff_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") and [Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh \"Edinburgh\") to retrieve the Mind Stone which is in Vision's forehead.

Vision asks Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone to keep it from Thanos, but she refuses. The group travels to [Wakanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakanda_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"), which Rogers believes has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision.\n\nNebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos's destroyed homeworld, [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Titan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"). Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. The trio crash-lands on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Using the Time Stone, Strange views millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which the [Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") win. The group formulates a plan to subdue Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, with which he safely houses and wields the Stones. Thanos appears, justifying his plans as necessary to guarantee the survival of an overpopulated universe. Nebula arrives soon after and helps the others subdue Thanos, but deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks Thanos, allowing him to break the group's hold and overpower them. Thanos grievously wounds Stark, but Strange offers the Time Stone in exchange for sparing Stark's life.\n\nIn Wakanda, Rogers reunites with [Bucky Barnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_Barnes_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, along with [T'Challa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%27Challa_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while [Shuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuri_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Unable to summon the Hulk, Banner fights in Stark's [Hulkbuster armor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulkbuster_armor_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Hulkbuster armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"). Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers. Together they kill Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive, and rout Thanos's army. Shuri cannot complete the extraction before Thanos arrives on the field; the Avengers and their allies fail to stop him from reaching Vision. Vision convinces a reluctant Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse her actions, rip the stone from Vision's forehead, and complete the Gauntlet. Thor severely wounds Thanos with Stormbreaker, but Thanos activates the completed Gauntlet by [snapping his fingers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blip \"The Blip\") before teleporting away.\n\nHalf of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Wanda, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, Parker, [Maria Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Hill_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"), and [Nick Fury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Fury_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"), the last of whom sends an emergency signal on a modified [pager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pager \"Pager\") before disintegrating.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War#cite_note-7) Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while Banner, [M'Baku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%27Baku_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"), [Okoye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okoye_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"), Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield.

It's Thursday, August 14, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.\n\n25 years ago Wikipedia was a dream. A wildly ambitious, probably impossible dream. A dream that came together piece by piece. Now, 65 million articles. 260,000 volunteers across the entire world. Here's to 25 years of knowledge, humanity, and collaboration at its best.\n\nMost readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year.

It is the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and the 13th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from a screenplay by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America alongside an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Marisa Tomei, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, Martin Freeman, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures the team into two opposing factions—one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark (Downey).\n\nDevelopment of Civil War began in late 2013 when Markus and McFeely began writing the screenplay, which borrows concepts from the 2006 comic book storyline \"Civil War\" while also focusing on story and character elements from the previous Captain America films to conclude the trilogy. Following positive reactions to The Winter Soldier, the Russo brothers were brought back to direct in early 2014. The film's title and premise were revealed in October 2014, along with Downey's involvement as Stark; additional cast members joined in the following months. Principal photography began in April 2015 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia. It continued in the Metro Atlanta area before concluding in Germany in August 2015, with the film being the first to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras (for the film's central airport fight sequence). Visual effects were provided by nearly 20 different studios.\n\nCaptain America: Civil War held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 12, 2016, and was released in the United States on May 6, as the first film in Phase Three of the MCU. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $1.1 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2016, and received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances (particularly Evans and Downey), action sequences, and themes. A fourth film, Captain America: Brave New World (2025), is a continuation of Marvel Studios' Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), following Mackie's Sam Wilson as Captain America.\n\nPlot\n\nIn 1991, the brainwashed super-soldier James \"Bucky\" Barnes is dispatched from a Hydra base in Siberia to intercept an automobile carrying a case of super-soldier serum. In the present day, approximately one year after Ultron is defeated by the Avengers in the nation of Sokovia,[a] Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff stop Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in Lagos. Rumlow blows himself up, attempting to kill Rogers. Maximoff telekinetically diverts the explosion, accidentally destroying a nearby building and killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers in the process.\n\nThaddeus Ross, the U.S. Secretary of State, informs the Avengers that the United Nations (UN) is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Tony Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of politicians. Meanwhile, Helmut Zemo tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. At a UN conference in Vienna where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom T'Chaka's son, T'Challa, vows to kill. Informed by Sharon Carter of Barnes' whereabouts and the authorities' intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes—his childhood friend and war comrade—himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to Bucharest and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended by the Bucharest police and James Rhodes.\n\nImpersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to activate Barnes's brainwashing. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed \"Winter Soldiers\" are kept in cryogenic stasis. Unwilling to wait for authorization to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, Clint Barton, and Scott Lang to their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, Rhodes, Vision, and Peter Parker to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at Leipzig/Halle Airport, where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. As Rogers and Barnes are escaping, Rhodes is inadvertently shot down by Vision, and becomes partially paralyzed. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, and Romanoff goes into exile.\n\nStark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables Stark's armor. Rogers departs with Barnes, leaving his shield behind. Satisfied that he has avenged his family's deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers' actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts suicide, but he is stopped by T'Challa and taken to the authorities.\n\nIn the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. In a mid-credits scene, Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a post-credits scene, Parker explores the features of the web shooters built for him by Stark.\n\nCast\n(L-R) Nate Moore, Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers, Paul Bettany, Daniel Brühl, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, and Emily VanCamp at the London premiere\nChris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:\nThe leader of a faction of Avengers against regulation;[7][8] a World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality and frozen in suspended animation, before waking up in the modern world.[9][10] Director Anthony Russo described Captain America's character arc in the film as taking \"him from the most ra-ra company man\" to someone who is \"a somewhat willing propagandist\" to \"an insurgent\" at the end of the film.[11] Unlike the comics' Civil War, the film was never going to kill Rogers, as the directors thought that was \"an easy ending ... The more difficult and more interesting place to leave a family fight is: can these important relationships ever be repaired? Is this family broken permanently?\"[12] Evans' training regimen to get in shape for the role included weight lifting, which consisted of \"the classic bodyweight and bodybuilding stuff\", gymnastics and plyometrics, while staying away from cardio-based exercises, along with a high-protein diet.[13] His costume in the film received \"subtle changes to all the details and cut\" as well as its color, becoming a combination of the stealth suit from The Winter Soldier and the Avengers: Age of Ultron suit.[14]\nRobert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:\nThe leader of a faction of Avengers in support of regulation;[7][8] a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own invention.[15][16] Anthony Russo said that Stark's egomania allowed the writers \"to bring him to a point in his life where he was willing to submit to an authority, where he felt it was the right thing to do.\" Joe Russo added that because of the visions Stark saw in Age of Ultron, he now has a guilt complex which \"drives him to make very specific decisions,\" calling his emotional arc \"very complicated\".[11] Downey's personal trainer Eric Oram stated that the trick to pitting Rogers against Stark, \"is to show Iron Man using the 'minimum force' necessary to win the fight\".[17] Marvel initially wanted Downey's part to be smaller, but \"Downey wanted Stark to have a more substantial role in the film's plot.\" Variety noted that Downey would receive $40 million plus backend for his participation, as well as an additional payout if the film outperformed The Winter Soldier, as Marvel would attribute that success to Downey's presence.[18]\nScarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:\nAn Avenger allied with Stark;[7][8] formerly a highly trained S.H.I.E.L.D. spy.[19] Anthony Russo noted her torn allegiances in the film, saying \"her head is with Tony's side of things, but her heart is with Cap in a lot of ways.\"[11] Johansson added that Romanoff is \"looking to strategize her position, putting herself in a place where she is able to let the powers that be fight it out\" in order for her to \"have a better perspective of what's really going on.\"[20] Describing her character's situation after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Johansson said, \"I think that the Widow's past will always haunt her. She's trying to move forward, she's trying to pick up the pieces of her life.\"[21] She also said that Romanoff is at a point in her life where she can make choices herself, without having others have a hand in the decision process.[22] On the continuation of the relationship between Romanoff and Rogers from The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo said that they wanted to \"test it\" by having Romanoff point out to Rogers the mistakes the team have made and convince him \"that it might not be as black and white as he sees it\" and that the Avengers must \"find a way to work within the system so that [they] aren't disbanded.\"[11]\nSebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier:\nA physically enhanced brainwashed assassin allied with Rogers;[7][8] his best friend who reemerged after being thought to be killed in action during World War II.[23][24][25] This portrayal is an amalgam of Barnes and the Winter Soldier, with Stan saying, \"here's the guy when you merge the two. This is what came out. To me, he's never really going to be Bucky Barnes again. There's going to be recognizable things about him, but his path through the [experiences of] Winter Soldier is always going to be there, haunting him.\"[26] Because of this, the character has more lines in the film than in The Winter Soldier.[27]\nAnthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon:\nAn Avenger allied with Rogers;[7][8] a former pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack.[28] Wilson is aided by a robotic drone named Redwing.[29] Discussing the relationship between Wilson and Rogers, Mackie said, \"With Falcon and Cap, what's so great is there's a mutual respect. There's a soldier respect. What's great about ... [Captain America: Civil War] is you get to see their relationship grow,\"[30] adding, \"He respects and admires Cap because Cap earned his rank as opposed to sitting in an office and just delegating orders.\"[31] Joe Russo stated that the inclusion of Barnes to Rogers' side forces Wilson to question the dynamic and relationship he has with Rogers going forward.[11]\nDon Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:\nA close personal friend of Tony Stark's and an Avenger allied with Stark;[7][8] an officer in the U.S. Air Force who operates the War Machine armor.[32] Cheadle called Rhodes' appearance in the film a \"bit more intense and pivotal\" compared to his previous appearances.[33]\nJeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:\nA master archer allied with Rogers;[7][8] a retired Avenger and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.[14][34] On Barton's reasons for joining Rogers' side, Renner said, \"Cap was the first guy who called. Let's just get the job done so I can get home to the family,\"[31] along with feeling an obligation to side with Wanda Maximoff, since her brother, Pietro Maximoff, sacrificed himself to save Barton in Avengers: Age of Ultron.[35] On how he and Barton fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Renner said, \"I'm happy to be the ensemble. I'm not scratching or clawing to do a solo movie by any means ... I think [Barton's] a utility guy that can bounce around into other people's universes a little bit\".[36]\nChadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther:\nThe prince of the African nation of Wakanda allied with Stark[7][8][37][38][39] who gains enhanced strength by ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb.[40] Producer Kevin Feige explained that the character was included \"because we needed a third party. We needed fresh eyes who wasn't embedded with the Avengers and who has a very different point of view than either Tony or Steve.\" T'Challa is in the \"beginning phases of taking on\" the Black Panther mantle,[41] and appears in more than a cameo, with a full arc and character journey with \"his own conflict and his own people that he's looking out for.\"[42] Boseman did not audition for the role, instead having a \"discussion about what [Marvel] wanted to do and how I saw it and what I wanted to do.\"[43] T'Challa is torn between needing to live up to traditions and the legacy of his father and Wakanda, and how things need to happen in the present.[42] Boseman developed the Wakandan accent himself, and used it during the entire production \"whether he was on camera or not\",[12] while the Wakandan language was based on the Xhosa language, which Boseman was taught by John Kani (who plays T'Challa's father T'Chaka).[44] The Black Panther costume is a combination of a practical costume and visual effects, featuring a vibranium mesh weave similar to chainmail.[11] Costume designer Judianna Makovsky called the Black Panther costume \"difficult\" since \"you needed sort of a feline body, but it's hard and practical at the same time. You needed a feeling of some sort of ethnicity in there, but of a world [Wakanda] we weren't really creating yet, so you didn't want to go too far and say too much about that world.\" Additionally, Makovsky felt creating T'Challa's royal look was \"a bit of a challenge\", avoiding African robes after learning actual African royalty are generally \"educated in the West [and] get dressed in Savile Row.\"[45] Boseman signed a five-picture deal with Marvel.[46]\nPaul Bettany as Vision:\nAn android and Avenger allied with Stark;[7][8] created using the artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, and the Mind Stone.[32] Because the Vision was only created in the previous film, Age of Ultron, Bettany said, \"you see my character get born... He must be both omnipotent and yet totally naive at the same time. And experiencing the world in real time and his place in it. Is he going to be a force of good or a force of evil?\"[47] Bettany also said he was interested in exploring \"what it means to be human and what love is\" with the character, as \"The only way one can guarantee one's loyalty is love.\"[48] This is exhibited in the connection Vision begins to form with Wanda Maximoff, with Bettany commenting, \"They both have these new burgeoning powers that they don't understand ... I think he's worried that they're both dangerous. So he feels this real connection with her.\"[49] As the Vision has the ability to create a projected disguise, he chooses to dress similarly to Howard Stark's attache, Edwin Jarvis.[14]\nElizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff:\nAn Avenger allied with Rogers;[8][50] she can engage in hypnosis and telekinesis.[51] According to Olsen, the character is \"coming into her own and starting to understand and have conflict with how she wants to use her abilities.\"[52] As such, Maximoff's costume was \"relatively casual\" and \"more clothes-based than superhero-based\" according to Makovsky, since the Russos believed Maximoff was not a full-fledged Avenger yet.[53] When asked about the relationship between her character and the Vision compared to the comics, Olsen said, \"You learn a little bit more about what connects [Scarlet and Vision] in this film. And I think there's some really sweet moments between Paul and I, and it's more about how they relate to one another and their similarities just based on their superpowers.\"[54]\nPaul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:\nA former electrical engineer turned petty criminal allied with Rogers;[7][8] he acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[32][55][56] Rudd's suit \"is streamlined and more high-tech\" than the one seen in Ant-Man.[14] Ant-Man director Peyton Reed had discussed the character and the way that the Ant-Man production had shot certain sequences with the Russo brothers, saying, \"As we were doing [Ant-Man] and we were in post and they were getting ready to head out to Atlanta to do Civil War, we had a lot of conversations ... It's important because there's this continuity that has to happen in this universe.\"[57] On the decision to have Lang grow in size to become Giant-Man in the airport battle, Feige said, \"It was just a great idea to turn the tide of the battle in a huge, shocking, unexpected way. We have a lot of ideas for [Ant-Man and the Wasp], none of which are contingent upon revealing Giant-Man, so we thought this would be the fun, unbelievable unexpected way to do that.\"[58] Anthony Russo added that the transformation was the continuation of Lang's character arc from Ant-Man, saying \"He's just really impressed with Captain America, he just wants to deliver and he figures out a way to deliver where he might actually tear himself in half but he's willing to do it and it works.\"[59]\nEmily VanCamp as Sharon Carter:\nA former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Peggy Carter's niece who now works for the CIA and supports Rogers.[7][8][60][61] VanCamp stated that her character sides with Rogers because they both have \"similar moral compasses\".[62] On a potential relationship between Rogers and Carter as in the comics, Evans said, \"he's certainly open to it. Sharon is obviously relevant, but ... we don't have to tie it up in one movie. So they have time.\"[22] VanCamp added, \"We get to explore... I can't say we are going to that extent of it, but they are certainly getting to know each other.\"[62]\nMarisa Tomei as May Parker: Peter Parker's aunt.[63]\nTom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:\nA teenager allied with Stark;[64] he received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[65][66][67][68] Feige said that Parker would be torn between superhero ideologies, saying, \"Does he want to be like these other characters? Does he want nothing to do with these other characters? How does that impact his experience, being this grounded but super powerful hero? Those are all the things that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko played with in the first 10 years of his comics, and that now we can play with for the first time in a movie.\"[69] On aligning with Stark, Anthony Russo said that, despite entering the conflict after the two factions have formed and not having much political investment, Parker's choice comes from \"a very personal relationship\" he develops with Stark.[64][70] The Russos hoped \"to take a very logical and realistic and naturalistic approach to the character\" compared to the previous film portrayals. Anthony Russo added that the character's introduction had to fit \"that specific tonal stylistic world\" of the MCU, as well as the tone established by the directors in The Winter Soldier, saying, \"It's a little more grounded and a little more hard-core contemporary.\" That was \"coloring our choices a lot\" with Parker.[71] On the Spider-Man suit, Joe Russo described it as \"a slightly more traditional, Steve Ditko influenced suit,\" and that the film would explore the way the suit operates, particularly the mechanical eyes.[72] Holland chose not to read the whole Civil War script in order to avoid potentially leaking plot information publicly.[73] He was initially signed on for at least three films, not including his Civil War appearance.[74] Holland later expanded, saying he was signed for \"three Spider-Man movies and three solo movies\".[75]\nFrank Grillo as Brock Rumlow:\nFormer commander of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s counter-terrorism S.T.R.I.K.E. team who was revealed to be an agent of Hydra. On returning to the character, Grillo said \"He's a badass. He is just vicious. I like the idea that it's no holds barred. I was 15 pounds (6.8 kg) bigger when I did Cap 2, and I'll put another 15 pounds (6.8 kg) on to do Cap 3.\"[76] However, he cautioned that \"This movie is such a big movie with a lot of people in it, so you don't get as much of the time that you'd like to have.\"[77] Grillo stated that Rumlow's main objective in the film is to seek revenge—\"Whatever Rumlow was feeling as far as being torn between which side he should be on, which I think he was, is gone now.\"[78]\nMartin Freeman as Everett K. Ross:\nA member of the CIA's Joint Counter Terrorism Center and a character associated with Black Panther in the comics.[79][80][81] Freeman described Ross as someone who \"works for the American government ... [and] works in conjunction with the superheroes, and certain agencies that help to tame the superheroes' power\".[82] Feige added that Ross would appear briefly in the film, with the intent being to expand on the character's role in future films;[65] Freeman signed a three-film contract, for this film, Black Panther (2018), and its sequel (2022).[83]\nWilliam Hurt as Thaddeus Ross:\nThe United States Secretary of State and a former U.S. Army general.[29][32] Hurt, on returning to the MCU after appearing in The Incredible Hulk, said, \"I don't think it's a reprise, I think it's a new iteration completely,\"[84] adding, \"what [the writers have] done is they've taken a character ... and made a new version... a more modernized style.\"[85] Joe Russo added that Ross was the perfect character to use because he has \"a fanatical anti-superhero point of view\" and has \"become much savvier and more political and has put himself in a position of power, not unlike a Colin Powell. He's cornering the Avengers politically now, he's out-maneuvering them.\" Joe also added that Ross was included because the Russos felt it was important to make The Incredible Hulk \"relevant again within the [MCU]\" since it \"may have been forgotten about a little bit\".[11]\nDaniel Brühl as Helmut Zemo:[28][86]\nA Sokovian colonel-turned-terrorist who is obsessed with defeating the Avengers. Zemo, who goes by multiple names in the film,[65] does not wear his signature mask from the comics. Brühl said the version appearing in the film is \"loosely connected\" to the character from the comics and that was a reason he liked Marvel, as \"some of the characters and things they're dealing with always reference to current events so my character is from a different area than you would think.\"[87] Feige described the character as \"very much a product of the [Marvel] Cinematic Universe and all that has occurred within that universe up to this point\",[65] while Anthony Russo called him \"an everyman. His approach was: I've seen these guys fight enough to know I can't win. But what I can do is figure out ways to undermine them. He's emotionally driven and he finds a weak spot.\"[12] Brühl, who was cast due to his German accent, did not feel the role was a stereotype, saying, \"It's not a guy who's mean and sinister, but he's actually very clever—a very smart guy who does everything out of a very understandable reason and motivation.\"[88] Brühl also stated that Zemo may re-appear in future MCU films,[87] with Moore adding that, while Zemo has a purpose in this film, it is more to set up a future film.[89]\n\nAdditionally, John Slattery and Kerry Condon reprise their roles as Howard Stark and the voice of F.R.I.D.A.Y. from previous MCU films.[90][91] John Kani appears as T'Chaka, father of T'Challa and ruler of Wakanda;[90] Hope Davis appears as Maria Stark, Tony Stark's mother;[92] Gene Farber appears as Vasily Karpov, the Hydra official who oversaw the Winter Soldier program;[93] and Florence Kasumba portrays Ayo, a member of T'Challa's Dora Milaje.[94] Alfre Woodard, who portrays Mariah Dillard in the MCU TV series Luke Cage, briefly appears in the film as Miriam Sharpe, the mother of an American citizen killed in the battle of Sokovia. Woodard was suggested for the role by Downey before Marvel Studios learned of her casting in Luke Cage.[95] Jim Rash appears as a faculty member at MIT,[96][97] while Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a FedEx deliveryman,[97][98] and co-director Joe Russo cameos as Theo Broussard, a psychiatrist murdered by Zemo.[93][99] Damion Poitier, who appeared as Thanos in The Avengers before Josh Brolin was cast in that role for subsequent films, appears as one of Rumlow's mercenaries.[93]\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\n\nThis is the Civil War of the Cinematic Universe, which will be greatly inspired by the \"Civil War\" of the comic universe, but we have a very different continuity going on ... It's not about the secret identity thing, as much as it is about, overall, who reports to who, and who can agree to [an] oversight committee. Because as of now, in [Age of Ultron], there is no more security council, there is no S.H.I.E.L.D., obviously. Stark is paying for [the Avengers], Captain America is running it, and things occur that will make governments begin to question.\n\n—Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios[100]\n\nIn March 2014, Anthony and Joe Russo confirmed that they had signed on to return as directors for a third Captain America film, along with Chris Evans as Captain America, Kevin Feige as producer, and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely as screenwriters.[10][101] Markus and McFeely had been working on the screenplay since late 2013,[102] while the Russo brothers began work in February 2014.[103][104] The re-hiring of the directors, three months before the release of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, came as a result of Marvel executives being impressed with test screenings of that film.[10] Evans earned $15 million for the film.[105]\n\nIn an April 2014 interview, Joe Russo described the project as a continuation of the story from Captain America: The Winter Soldier: \"What's nice about the film is that ... it's a two-parter. There's a journey that the Winter Soldier goes on that isn't complete yet.\"[106] That month, Marvel announced a release date of May 6, 2016,[107] and Trent Opaloch, who was the cinematographer on The Winter Soldier, said he would return for the sequel.[108] In July, Markus and McFeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015.[109] The following month, they stated that they were looking to make the tone of the film \"an amalgam\" of The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier,[110] with the Russos likening it to a psychological thriller, citing Seven, Fargo, and The Godfather as influences,[8] along with westerns and Brian De Palma's films.[89] The Russos also stated that \"a good portion of [Civil War is] actually funnier than Winter Soldier\" with a more comedic tone and lighter moments throughout.[111]\n\nIn August 2014, the Russos stated that the film would be set \"a couple years\" after The Winter Soldier, and would continue to focus on Steve Rogers' relationship with Bucky Barnes as well as the political themes related to Captain America. Anthony stated, \"The character was invented for an explicitly political purpose. So it's hard to get away from that nature.\" The Russos also said that they would be \"bringing some new elements to the table that will give us a twist on Winter Soldier\",[112] and indicated that filming was scheduled to begin in Atlanta. They described themselves as \"ecstatic\" with a first draft of the screenplay submitted by Markus and McFeely, and also stated that the film's title would be announced \"in a month or so at most\", and that the concept and title for the film came from Feige, who had it \"for a while\".[103][113] In September, Joe expanded by saying the film would have another \"big idea that alters the universe as a whole in some way\" similar to S.H.I.E.L.D. falling in The Winter Soldier. The rest of the film, such as the characters, story, and tone, would be left open to the Russos' and writers' interpretations.[113]\n\nPre-production\n\nBy October 2014, Robert Downey Jr. had entered final negotiations to reprise his role as Tony Stark / Iron Man in the film. Downey was added in order for the film to adapt the 2006–07 \"Civil War\" comic book storyline written by Mark Millar, which pitted Iron Man against Captain America.[18] At the end of the month, it was confirmed that Sebastian Stan would return as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier.[23] A few days later, Marvel revealed that the film would be titled Captain America: Civil War, confirming Downey's appearance and announcing that Chadwick Boseman would appear in the film as Black Panther ahead of his own solo film.[15][37][38] Feige also confirmed that the film would be the first in the MCU's Phase Three slate of films.[100] Anthony Russo stated that adapting the \"Civil War\" storyline was not always the intended storyline and direction for the film when the brothers initially signed on to return as directors.[114] Markus expanded on this, saying the original concept for a third Captain America film \"never got to draft\", with Feige at some point telling the writing team to begin adapting \"Civil War\" around their original ideas. McFeely also added that, despite the shift in direction for the film, \"The central theme, even the way Zemo is operating, are from that [early] iteration.\"[115] The Russos revealed that, had negotiations with Downey to appear in the film failed, they would have used the Madbomb storyline from the Captain America comics, which was eventually used as a plot point in the first season of the Agent Carter TV series. The premise for the film would have centered on Zemo detonating the Madbomb, which would \"turn hordes of people into berserkers\" to present a physical threat to Captain America, while still pitting heroes against each other, as some would be zombified due to the Madbomb, to satisfy an \"emotional component\" for the film.[116]\n\nMcFeely said that the idea of basing a film on \"Civil War\" had \"been on and off the table for a while\" at Marvel Studios, explaining, \"it's a challenge to do it and make sure that all the characters that we've established, and everyone's established in the MCU are serviced and sound correct. Because there's a difference between the characters in \"Civil War\", which was written in 2006, 2007. The MCU doesn't exist [when it was written]. There isn't a Robert Downey Jr. or Chris Evans who has helped create the character[s] so we need to make sure that that template gets adjusted\".[117] Joe Russo added that the \"essence\" of \"Civil War\" was used, such as \"the concept of registration, the notion that heroes need to be either monitored or controlled because their power can be scary\" being applicable. Anthony Russo expanded, \"in a lot of ways [superhero registration] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist on that level. We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated. That's what the relationship between Steve and Bucky allowed us to do, to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or the other.\"[11] Executive producer Nate Moore added that \"it felt like it was kind of the right time\" to adapt \"Civil War\" given The Avengers, plus many of the Phase Two films (Thor: The Dark World, The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), all dealt with \"world-ending experiences. We felt like we had to tell the next step in that story, which is ... what is the world's reaction?\"[8]\n\nExecutives at Marvel Entertainment balked at the idea of Captain America and Iron Man coming to blows at the end of the film and wanted the Avengers to unite to fight Zemo and the supersoldiers at the Hydra base in Siberia instead. The Russos were not happy with this idea, with Joe Russo saying, \"There's nothing interesting about that film. We're not here to make that movie. We're not interested in telling another superhero story.\" Feige supported the Russos, who were going to leave the film if the changes were forced on them.[118] This prompted Walt Disney Studios head Alan F. Horn to back the Russos in making the film as originally intended, and led to oversight of Marvel Studios being moved from Marvel Entertainment to Walt Disney Studios in 2015.[119]\n\nIn November 2014, Daniel Brühl joined the cast in an unspecified role,[28] while Anthony Mackie and Frank Grillo were confirmed to return as Sam Wilson / Falcon and Brock Rumlow / Crossbones, respectively.[28][76] Following the November 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures' computers, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released stating that Marvel wanted to include Spider-Man (whose film rights are licensed to Sony) in the film, but talks between the studios concerning this were believed to have broken down.[120] However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios reached a licensing deal for the use of Spider-Man in an MCU film,[121] and reports indicated that the character would indeed appear in Civil War.[122][123] The Russos stated they were lobbying for months to include the character in the film.[111] In January 2015, Mackie revealed that, in addition to Atlanta, filming locations would include Puerto Rico and Berlin,[124] while the Russo brothers confirmed that Scarlett Johansson would return in the film as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow.[19] Editor Jeffrey Ford, who worked on The Winter Soldier, also signed on for Civil War.[125] In March 2015, Jeremy Renner was revealed to be reprising his role as Clint Barton / Hawkeye.[34] The next month, it was revealed that the film would be converted to 3D in post-production,[126] and that Brühl would be playing Helmut Zemo.[86] Additionally, Elizabeth Olsen revealed she would reprise her role in the film as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch.[51]\n\nFilming\nFilm set for Captain America: Civil War in Downtown Atlanta\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 27, 2015,[126][127] in Fayette County, Georgia, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios,[128] under the working title Sputnik.[129] Other filming locations in the Atlanta metropolitan area included the Buckhead district of Atlanta;[130] the Peachtree Christian Church in Midtown Atlanta;[131] Downtown Atlanta,[132] including an area near Philips Arena known as The Gulch, which served as the market in Lagos;[133] Norcross, Georgia;[130] Porsche's headquarters in Atlanta at Aerotropolis Atlanta, which served as the Avengers' headquarters in the film;[31] and the Atlanta Civic Center, which served as the IFID (Institute for Infectious Diseases) laboratory in Lagos; the latter's interiors doubled as MIT, and a third part was used for a Berlin location.[133] Trent Opaloch served as director of photography,[108] while Chad Stahelski, David Leitch, and The Winter Soldier stuntman Spiro Razatos were second unit directors.[134]\n\nIn early May, Marvel announced that Martin Freeman was cast in an unspecified role,[79] while also reprising roles in the film would be Paul Bettany as Vision, Don Cheadle as James Rhodes / War Machine, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter, and William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross.[32][60] Samuel L. Jackson, who appeared as Nick Fury in the two previous Captain America films, said he was \"surprised\" to discover that he would not be in Captain America: Civil War, after \"the Russo Brothers told [him he] was.\"[135] Moore stated that Fury was not included \"because he didn't add anything to the Civil War story they were telling\",[89] while Markus stated that they did not want him to choose any particular side because \"that's not his place in the universe\".[136] On each of the character's ties to the plot, Anthony Russo said that each character was examined on a personal level to see how they would respond to the idea of registration.[11] On the portrayal of each character, Joe Russo said that he and his brother had strong \"emotional\" and \"psychological connection[s] to [these] characters\" as children, adding, \"We want to reach into that and understand what elementally motivated you to love the character. That's what we try to bring out in the characters now.\" He also mentioned that they were \"trying to honor the feeling of naturalism and to honor the feeling of reality [with the film].\"[71]\n\nAfter the reveal of the film's full cast, many outlets and fans began referring to the film as \"Avengers 2.5 \", given the variety and ensemble nature of the cast, usually reserved for the Avengers films, and the fact that the film no longer felt like a Captain America-centric one, as with The Winter Soldier.[137][138][139][140][141] In response to this, Feige said, \"What's fun about Civil War though is, as you know from the comics, it's a very simple story. And it really has to be, to accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the Winter Soldier in ways I don't think people [will expect].... It's a very simple structure that allows you to have these amazing character interactions in a way that I don't think becomes overwhelming.\"[142] Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne / Wasp was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because \"there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice,\" saying Marvel was \"saving\" the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see \"her dynamic with Scott [Lang] in a way it could play out\".[143]\n\nAt the end of May, the Russo brothers, along with Feige and Pascal, held a screen test in Atlanta for six teenage actors that were being eyed for the role of Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the actors testing against Downey and Evans for \"chemistry\";[74][114][144] Tom Holland was cast as the character the next month, to also appear in a solo film.[66] The Russos \"were pretty vocal about who we wanted for the part\", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker in the comics, in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals,[65] with Anthony Russo believing Holland's age was one of the factors Sony was initially hesitant on Holland for the role.[145] They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background.[65] Downey felt of all the actors he tested with, Holland brought \"gravitas and the confidence to be able to take on the mantle\" of portraying Spider-Man.[145] At the time, Marvel did not confirm his involvement in Civil War,[67][146] due to being contractually obligated not to talk about his inclusion publicly.[65] The Russos discussed this, saying that the various business deals and agreements stemming from the sharing of the character rights, such as on a promotional and commercial level, \"were always lagging slightly behind how we were using the character. We were always in danger of upsetting the deal—there were still sensitive issues going on between the two studios that they needed to agree on.\"[147]\n\nHolland was confirmed to appear in the film in July 2015, by Jonathan M. Goldstein, one of the writers of the solo Spider-Man film,[68] and later by Entertainment Weekly from a set visit.[65] Jon Watts, director of Spider-Man: Homecoming, was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes, in order to \"see what they were doing with it, and that informed where we eventually took it,\" and provide \"ideas about this and that\",[148] such as what Parker's wardrobe and bedroom should look like, \"to make sure we were all on the same page so that [Homecoming] transitions seamlessly with theirs.\"[149] Anthony Russo stated that, despite Marvel telling them to have a \"plan B\" should the deal with Sony fail, the Russos never created one because \"it was very important to us to reintroduce\" Spider-Man in the film, adding, \"We only have envisioned the movie with Spider-Man.\"[150]\n\nBy the end of June, filming reached the halfway mark,[151] with production moving to Germany in early August.[152] Filming locations in Germany included the Olympic Stadium,[153] Potsdamer Platz,[154] Internationales Congress Centrum Berlin and Messe Berlin in Berlin,[153] and the Leipzig/Halle Airport in Schkeuditz.[153] Studio work was done at Babelsberg Studio.[154] Additional filming also took place in Puerto Rico and Norway,[32][124][155] and was scheduled to in Iceland.[32] Principal photography wrapped on August 22, 2015.[156][157]\n\nCaptain America: Civil War was the first film to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras, made in partnership with Arri, which was a customized version of the Arri Alexa 65. According to Joe Russo, approximately fifteen minutes of the film, the sequence where the two factions fight at Leipzig/Halle Airport, which was described as having \"incredible scale to it\" and referred to by the directors as the \"splash panel\", were shot with the cameras.[56][126] Opaloch noted that there were discussions late in pre-production to shoot the entire film with the Alexa 65 cameras. However, because of how close it was to the start of shooting as well as the idea being \"such a large-scale undertaking\", it was decided to only use them for the airport sequence, with the rest of film being shot on Arri Alexa XT digital cameras. For the airport sequence, Opaloch rigged the Alexa 65s to a Technocrane, a Steadicam, a dolly as well as a drone for flyover shots, which had its own dedicated team operating it. Because of the amount of resolution the Alexa 65s offered, Opaloch chose to use medium close-ups instead of close-ups, and for his wide shots, hold the shot a bit longer, \"maybe with a slight camera move that allows the viewer to take it all in.\"[158]\n\nPost-production\n\nIn September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, who plays Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his character was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed due to the end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not \"want to reveal where [he is] and why\" in this film.[159] Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, \"You've got to kind of choose your roster [of characters] depending on what kind of fight you want to have.\"[65] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear at the very end of the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, \"[The Hulk] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [Age of] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie.\"[160] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross \"was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix.\" Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.[161]\n\nThat November, Joe Russo stated that the theme of the film was betrayal, calling it \"extremely emotional. [The film] hinges on that emotion, and on a very personal level we didn't want [it] to become about politics and people arguing about platitudes. The third act is built around a very personal moment between [Captain America and Iron Man].\"[11] The Russos spent a great deal of time with Markus, McFeely, and Moore to ensure each character's emotional arc tracked through the entire film correctly, though realized that at some point \"you have to sacrifice logic for expediency\".[89] Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, \"This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months.\"[111] They also stated that the film would be doing \"a few reshoots\" in mid-to-late January.[111][162]\n\nIn February, Freeman's character was revealed to be Everett K. Ross,[80] and Gwyneth Paltrow was reported to have joined the film for the January reshoots, reprising her role as Pepper Potts;[163] however, in April 2016, it was revealed that Paltrow does not appear in the film,[164] with Anthony Russo explaining that Paltrow's contract with Marvel had ended after Iron Man 3, and \"we decided early on that we could make Pepper's break-up [with Tony Stark] have an emotional impact without actually having a scene with her.\"[12] On March 16, 2016, the Russos stated the film was \"about a week and a half away from\" completion,[165] with Joe adding that the film would have a post-credits scene, with the possibility for two or three total.[72] The film was completed on April 4, 2016.[166] Later in April, Alfre Woodard and Jim Rash were revealed to be cast in the film,[96] while Feige explained that Black Panther director Ryan Coogler contributed some dialogue for Black Panther in several scenes during reshoots.[167] At the film's premiere, it was revealed that Marisa Tomei appears in the film as May Parker, Peter Parker's aunt.[63]\n\nVisual effects\nOriginal (top) and postvisualization (bottom) shots of the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport\n\nNearly 20 visual effects studios worked on Captain America: Civil War including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, DNEG, Image Engine, Trixter, Cinesite, and The Third Floor amongst others. Lola VFX de-aged Downey Jr. in a scene that involved a younger holographic version of himself. Lola VFX's visual effects supervisor, Trent Claus said, \"In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr. Downey at the approximate age that we wanted to target, which was around the time of the film Less than Zero [when Downey was in his early 20s].\" He also noted the difficulty of the scene, due to it being close to 4,000 frames, and the fact that Downey was moving his head from side to side multiple times. Lola also worked on visual effects for the Vision.[155] The Third Floor extensively previsualized the film including the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport. Gerardo Ramirez, the Previs and Postvis Supervisor for The Third Floor said:\n\nWe visualized most of the major scenes in the film, some that were more story driven and some that were more action and story driven. The Russos used various methods for planning and they used each department for what it does best. The early edits were a combination of storyboards, previs and stunt performance clips. Stunts would choreograph the hand-to-hand action while the storyboards would be used for character story moments and previs was used for the big action scenes that involved many digital characters.[155]\n\nMethod Studios, which worked on 440 shots, was responsible for the helicopter sequence in the middle of the film and the climactic fight between Iron Man, Bucky, and Captain America. The original intent for the helicopter sequence was to place the scene next to the Paul-Löbe-Haus, where the Bundestag meets; however, the location was not allowed to be shown in the film, resulting in Method needing to create a full CGI background. For the climactic fight, one of the challenges for Method was getting the color of Iron Man's suit correct, opting to go with a more \"classic Iron Man look versus the really glossy car paint look\" that Iron Man had in the previous Avengers films. ILM was primarily responsible for the visual effects during the large-scale fight sequence at the airport, along with creating the digital assets for all of the characters. VFX supervisor Russell Earl, stated that the 20-minute scene grew to be an almost fully digital sequence explaining, \"We ultimately ended up replacing 99% of everything that was shot with the actors being lifted from the background. Originally both Spider-Man and Black Panther were planned to be photographed elements but we ended up almost completely replacing them.\" Luma Pictures, who also worked on The Winter Soldier, was assigned with completing shots of Bucky's arm and his metal brainwashing chair. They also worked on Bucky's escape from the task force lobby and designed Iron Man's new hybrid nanotechnology armor, which was an homage to the character's Bleeding Edge armor from the comics. Their work totaled approximately 200 shots.[155] Spider-Man was a digital double for all of his appearances, featuring his finalized suit; on-set, Holland wore a temporary Spider-Man suit that featured raised webbing and a different spider emblem, or a motion capture suit.[168]\n\nDesign firm Sarofsky once again worked on the film's main-on-end title sequence, having done the same for The Winter Soldier. The sequence used \"muted and mottled, burnt umber and steel blue and cold grey\" colors, which were stark contrasts to the sequences for The Winter Soldier and The First Avenger (the latter created by Method Design) which were \"a minimalist graphic approach, reducing the key players to silhouettes and paring the palette down to three colors\" and \"vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life, enticing the viewer to join the fray\", respectively. Creative director Erin Sarofsky noted one of the challenges for Civil War's sequence was \"to make it feel like a Captain America title sequence and not an Avengers sequence\" given the number of characters in the film.[169]\n\nMusic\nMain articles: Captain America: Civil War (soundtrack) and Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nHenry Jackman returned from The Winter Soldier to score the sequel.[170] He found the movie to be tonally different from the previous one, which necessitated a much more symphonic and orchestral score. This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as \"somewhat operatic and ... almost classical in its style\".[171] Though Jackman reprised and developed his themes for Captain America and the Winter Soldier from the previous film,[172][173] and introduced motifs for the new characters Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo,[171] he was wary of pushing the audience to one side of the central conflict or the other by using character-specific music; Jackman composed a new main theme for the film to represent the Civil War, \"a generic theme to balance everything out\",[174] \"toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes.\"[175] Jackman also wrote a thriller theme that appears whenever the mystery surrounding Zemo's plan is explored. This was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith.[172] The score was released on a soundtrack album by Hollywood Records on May 6, 2016.[176]\n\nMarketing\nPromotion\n\nIn early July 2015, Marvel began a viral marketing campaign for Ant-Man featuring Leslie Bibb, reprising her role from the Iron Man films as journalist Christine Everhart, reporting for the faux news program, WHIH Newsfront. In one program, Everhart discusses events leading to Captain America: Civil War.[177] The post-credits scene for Ant-Man featured footage shot by the Russo brothers for Captain America: Civil War,[178][179] showing Wilson and Rogers with Barnes in their custody, and unable to contact Stark because of \"the accords\"; Wilson mentions that he \"know[s] a guy\", implying Lang.[180] Feige explained that when the post-credit sequence appears in Civil War it may appear with \"different takes...different angles.\"[178] Stan said the scene was shot in early May 2015, and would appear in the middle of Civil War.[27] The first footage of the film debuted in August 2015 at the D23 Expo.[29] Additional footage was shown in September 2015 at the Asia Pop Comic Convention.[181] The footage shown at the D23 Expo and 2015 Asia Pop Comic Convention received an overwhelmingly positive response from the audiences.[182]\n\nThe first trailer for the film debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on November 25, 2015, and within hours became the number one trending topic on Twitter.[183] The trailer was viewed 61 million times in the first 24 hours of release, surpassing the 34 million views of Avengers: Age of Ultron's in 2014.[184] Scott Mendelson of Forbes called the trailer a \"doozy\" and noted that the early debut ahead of the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a \"good show\" on behalf of Disney as it was \"a way to not get lost amid the 8,000 other trailers debuting with Star Wars\". Mendelson also noted that based on the trailer's content, the film was being \"sold as Captain America 3, as opposed to Avengers 2.5 or Iron Man 4,\" which could help keep the film's box office expectations in check.[185]\n\nOn February 4, 2016, Marvel released their own version of the Facebook \"#FriendsDay\" video for Captain America. The video mirrors those created by Facebook for users to celebrate the anniversary of Facebook's founding, and features images of Captain America's \"friends\" the Winter Soldier, Thor, Falcon and Hawkeye. The video concludes with an image of Captain America and Iron Man being torn in half. Jennifer Konerman of The Hollywood Reporter called the video \"timely\" and its contents \"especially relevant considering the storyline\" of Civil War.[186] Three days later, a teaser debuted during Super Bowl 50, which received the most social media activity out of all the film trailers released that day.[187][188] Anthony Breznican of Entertainment Weekly said the footage \"actually feels a little more like a teaser [than a full trailer], since it shows some new shots, but really doesn't reveal much more about the story.\" Additionally, he felt the chanting \"unseen voices calling out, 'United...We...Stand' and 'Divided...We...Fall'\" had \"a football stadium vibe\", complimenting it appearing during the Super Bowl.[189] Mendelson added that Marvel did not need to follow the model used for The Winter Soldier during Super Bowl XLVIII of showing a longer trailer after the teaser since Civil War was \"frankly [a] higher-profile sequel.\" Overall, Mendelson felt the spot was \"only a little less low-key and small(er)-scale as the trailer that debuted in\" November 2015, and sold the \"real world\" aspect \"with character drama and mostly real-world action between would-be superheroes.\"[190]\n\nFour days later, on Valentine's Day, the Facebook campaign was continued, with Marvel creating a \"faux-status update\" for Captain America, showing his relationship status had changed to \"In a Complicated Relationship with Iron Man\".[191] At The Walt Disney Company's annual shareholder meeting in the Auditorium Theatre in March, CEO Bob Iger presented a clip from the film to \"generous applause\".[192] From March 7 to 10, Marvel released individual posters for characters in the film,[193] continued its Facebook campaign with two teaser videos showcasing the participants on \"Team Cap\" and \"Team Iron Man\", and released a second trailer.[194] The trailer was viewed close to 95 million times within the first 24 hours of release, surpassing the views achieved by the first trailer. In addition, 240,000 social media posts across Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Facebook, among others, were made related to the trailer, surpassing the 81,000 the Age of Ultron trailer received in 2014.[195] According to internet analytics firm ZEFR, the trailer was viewed over 62 million times from YouTube and Facebook over four days, making it the second most viewed trailer at the time, behind the 64.6 million views for the first Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer.[196] It also became the top trailer in 2016 through March 13, 2016, according to research firm ListenFirst, for receiving the most likes, retweets and other engagement on Twitter.[197] The trailer continued to be the top viewed trailer on YouTube and Facebook for three straight weeks according to ZEFR, receiving more than 96 million total views since its release.[198]\n\nMendelson called the trailer \"a textbook case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone out there who watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?\" He added that he was \"a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal,\"[199] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the \"courage\" to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the \"Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz\".[193] Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving \"us more explanation [and context] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man\",[200] and by including Spider-Man since \"there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven to go out to the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [Spider-Man] because it's the sort of value-added element that can make [a] difference\".[200] Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal \"alone makes the trailer\", describing it as feeling \"like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be.\"[201]\n\nWith the film seemingly continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered \"to what extent the whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron. As much great stuff as that movie has ... [it ultimately shows] the main hero foolishly/recklessly [bring] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and yet no one seems to care at the end ... What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be at a point where we really can't judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?\"[199] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was \"in an awkward place with Civil War\" regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would \"actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules\" as well. \"Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [should now be] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing on the other side of that wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?\"[201]\n\nAlso in March, Marvel, in partnership with the National Academy of Sciences Science & Entertainment Exchange, Dolby Laboratories, Broadcom, and Synchrony Bank, announced the \"Girls Reforming the Future Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields, to submit projects they feel can change the world and have far-reaching effects. Five winners would attend the world premiere at the Dolby Theatre, and receive a tour of Walt Disney Studios and a $500 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving an internship at Marvel Studios.[202] On April 10, Evans debuted an exclusive clip of the film during the 2016 MTV Movie Awards.[203] Throughout the month, the Russo brothers and the cast promoted the film in Paris, Beijing, Singapore, Berlin and London.[204] At the end of the month, Marvel released additional viral marketing videos of WHIH Newsfront, featuring Bibb once again reprising her role as Everhart. In the program, Everhart discusses with \"political analyst\" Will Adams, portrayed by Al Madrigal, the cost the Avengers bring for saving the world, and if they should have regulation from the government.[205] Additional Newsfront segments saw William Sadler reprise his role as President Matthew Ellis, including an \"exclusive\" interview and his reaction to the incident involving the Avengers in Lagos.[206][207] On May 2, 2016, Evans, Renner, and executives from Marvel rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in honor of the film's theatrical release.[208]\n\nMerchandise\n\nAt the 2015 Licensing International Expo, Disney Consumer Products announced that they would partner with licensees including Hasbro, Lego, Funko, Hot Wheels, Rubies, Mad Engine, C-Life, Jay Franco, Global Brand Group, Kellogg's, Hallmark and American Greetings to sell merchandise related to the film;[209] Coca-Cola,[210] Google, Samsung, Wrigley, Harley Davidson, Audi, Synchrony Financial, Pringles, Keebler, Pizza Hut, Pop Secret, Mouser Electronics, and Vivo, among other brands, were also licensees for the film.[211] Paul Gitter, senior VP of licensing for Marvel at Disney Consumer Products said that they will build off the success of licensed products for Avengers: Age of Ultron, including a focus on a celebration of Captain America's 75th anniversary, female apparel, healthy living and travel, and on marketing newer characters such as War Machine, Falcon, Vision, Black Widow and Black Panther. \"The Avengers team is both aspirational and hugely merchandisable, made up of multiple, unique heroes coming together with amazing skills, cool vehicles and a high tech headquarters,\" said Gitter. \"Captain America: Civil War not only gives us new storytelling for our favorite superheroes, but also introduces new ones allowing us to expand product lines for kids and fans.\"[209] As part of the $200 million marketing effort for the film, Harley Davidson created two customized motorcycles for the film, Audi debuted a commercial directed by the Russos featuring unreleased scenes from the film, while Pizza Hut debuted collectible boxes and Kellogg's, Pringles, and Keebler products featured virtual reality experiences. The lead-up to the film's release culminated in a massive online vote across Google, YouTube, and Twitter for either Team Captain America or Team Iron Man.[211]\n\nMarvel Comics released a four-issue comic prelude by writer Will Corona Pilgrim and artist Szymon Kudranski, beginning in December 2015, that adapted the events of Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.[212] On February 10, Marvel Comics released another comic prelude, a single-issue infinite comic set between The Winter Soldier and Civil War.[213] Written again by Pilgrim, the comic is told from the perspectives of Barnes, Rumlow, and Rogers, showing how each ended up where they begin Civil War. Art for each character's perspective is provided by Lee Ferguson, Goran Sudžuka, and Guillermo Mogorron, respectively.[214]\n\nRelease\nTheatrical\n\nCaptain America: Civil War premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 12, 2016,[202] and was screened at CinemaCon 2016 on April 13.[215] The film's Southeast Asia premiere was held on April 21 at the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore,[216] while the European premiere took place at Vue Cinemas in Westfield London on April 26.[217] The film was released internationally starting from April 27,[199] releasing in 61 countries its first weekend,[218] including the United Kingdom on April 29.[219] The North America release on May 6,[107] took place in over 4,200 theaters, of which 3,300 were in 3D, along with 378 IMAX theaters, 480 premium large-format, and 161 D-Box locations.[220] Internationally, the film opened in 955 IMAX theaters,[221] while South Korea saw Civil War open in an \"unprecedented\" 1,989 theaters.[222] Captain America: Civil War was the first film released in Phase Three of the MCU.[100] In September 2014, TNT acquired the cable broadcast rights for Captain America: Civil War to air two years after its theatrical release.[223]\n\nHome media\n\nCaptain America: Civil War was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on September 2, 2016, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and DVD on September 13, 2016. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and an exclusive preview of Doctor Strange.[224] The digital release comes with an exclusive \"mockumentary\" short film, Team Thor, directed by Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, which was originally screened at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 and showed what Thor was doing during the events of Civil War.[225][226] Captain America: Civil War was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on April 23, 2019.[227] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[228]\n\nReception\nBox office\n\nCaptain America: Civil War grossed $408.1 million in the U.S. and Canada and $745.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.153 billion.[4] By May 10, 2016, the film had grossed $737.8 million, surpassing the entire theatrical gross of its predecessor, Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($714.4 million).[229] It became the highest-grossing film of 2016,[230][231] the fourth-highest-grossing superhero film of all time,[232] and the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. and Canada of 2016, behind Rogue One and Finding Dory.[233] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $193.4 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it eighth on their list of 2016's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[3]\n\nUnited States and Canada\n\nTwo weeks ahead of its release, Fandango announced that the film outsold all previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films at the same point in the sales cycle,[234] and by its opening week, had reached the highest advance sales for a superhero film, representing 90% of the site's weekend ticket sales.[235] Captain America: Civil War earned $75.5 million on its opening day. The film's Friday gross included $25 million from Thursday previews, the second-highest Thursday preview gross among Marvel films, with $3.1 million of the $25 million coming from IMAX theaters, a new Marvel record. The film went on to earn $61.2 million on Saturday and $42.4 million on Sunday, for a total opening weekend gross of $179.1 million, the third-highest for a Marvel film and fifth-highest of all time. Of the $179.1 million, $16 million was from IMAX, the second best for an MCU film.[236] Initial projections for Captain America: Civil War had it earning between $175–200 million on its opening weekend,[237][238] with the projection being revised to $172–178 million after Friday.[236] BoxOffice called it \"the safest box office bet\" since Star Wars: The Force Awakens.[239] The film remained at number one in its second weekend,[240] and fell to second in its third, behind The Angry Birds Movie.[241] In its fourth weekend, Captain America: Civil War became the highest-grossing film of 2016 in North America,[242] and by June 17, 2016, became the first film of 2016 to surpass $400 million.[243]\n\nOther territories\n\nCaptain America: Civil War's opening in 15 countries on April 27, 2016, earned $14.9 million,[218] followed by $23.8 million the next day from 15 more countries, and $45.3 million two days later from 8 additional countries, for a three-day total of $84 million.[244] Its first weekend brought a total of $200.4 million,[221] after being projected to earn anywhere between $180–250 million,[245] with $9.4 million coming from IMAX. The film debuted at number one in all countries except Japan.[221] The film stayed at number one in its second weekend, earning $217 million, with existing territories seeing a 55% decline in earnings, while surpassing the entire international earnings of previous Captain America films, along with other MCU films. For IMAX in its second weekend, Captain America: Civil War earned $31 million, a new record for a day-and-date opening for a Marvel film.[246] By its third weekend, the film remained at number one in some territories, being overtaken by The Angry Birds Movie in others, and became the top film of 2016 and fourth-highest-grossing superhero film outside of North America.[247]\n\nIt set records for the largest opening day in Mexico ($7.3 million),[244] opening day of 2016 in France ($2.4 million),[218] the second-largest opening day in Brazil ($2.7 million)[244] and the United Arab Emirates,[246] the largest superhero opening day in the Netherlands,[244] and the largest superhero opening in Turkey and Ukraine.[246] It set opening weekend records in Brazil ($12.9 million), Mexico ($20.4 million), and the Philippines ($7.7 million), and was the second-largest opening weekend in Hong Kong ($6.9 million) and Thailand ($9.4 million). In the United Kingdom, the film earned the second-largest opening day and weekend of 2016 with $20.5 million, while France had the top 2016 opening weekend with $10.1 million. Germany had the best four-day opening of 2016 with $8.1 million, and Spain had the second-largest three-day opening of 2016 with $4.2 million.[221] For South Korea, the film was the largest non-Korean opening and largest Marvel opening in history.[222] China had the second best IMAX opening ($9.5 million), as well as the second-largest opening weekend for a Hollywood film ($95.6 million),[246] with the film eventually becoming the third-highest Disney release in the country after 10 days,[247] and the second largest superhero film.[232] Japan saw the film open third with $4.2 million, behind Detective Conan: The Darkest Nightmare ($5.3 million) and Zootopia ($4.8 million).[248] The film's largest markets were China ($190.4 million), South Korea ($62.8 million), and the United Kingdom ($53.2 million).[249]\n\nCritical response\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 90%, with an average score of 7.7/10, based on 431 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Captain America: Civil War begins the next wave of Marvel movies with an action-packed superhero blockbuster boasting a decidedly non-cartoonish plot and the courage to explore thought-provoking themes.\"[250] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 75 out of 100 based on 53 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[251] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an \"A\" grade on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 88% overall positive score and a 75% \"definite recommend\".[236]\n\nJustin Chang of Variety called it \"the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[252] Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Call it 'civil war' or call it brand extension; call it a 'cinematic universe' or a corporate behemoth—the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio's cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that's sure to satisfy devotees.\"[253] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote, \"This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything—and all—it wants to be.\"[254] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian called it, \"a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty.\"[255] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines, and only occasionally getting us (and by us I mean me) lost in the geek weeds.\"[256] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, \"If you live and breathe Marvel, this is one of the MCU's stronger offerings. If you are a spy coming in from the cold, the answer is not so clear.\"[257] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, \"Captain America: Civil War does not in any way transcend the conventions of the genre. On the contrary: It succeeds because it doesn't really try.\"[258]\n\nConversely, Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News said, \"Although it's called Captain America: Civil War, the latest Marvel movie is actually a supersized Avengers picture—overstuffed to bursting. And sometimes during its two and a half hour running time, it just goes bust.\"[259] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \"As a work of thought, Civil War is compromised, but at least there are thoughts to compromise. As an action film, it has its moments, but aside from the big opening sequence—the action scenes are a bit flat.\"[260] Andrew O'Hehir writing for Salon said, \"Much of Captain America: Civil War is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from Captain America: The Winter Soldier two summers ago.\"[261] While Nicholas Barber of the BBC gave the film a generally favorable review, praising both its visuals and action sequences, he criticized the fact that there was \"no cogent reason for any of [the Avengers] to be on one side or the other, which is why their inevitable dust-up feels like a game of dodgeball in a school playground.\"[262] Mark Millar, writer of the \"Civil War\" comic storyline on which the film was based, felt the film \"had a good opening twenty [minutes], but then I honestly can't remember what the movie was about.\" He also felt the film lacked levity, especially considering the Russo brothers' background in comedy.[263]\n\nAccolades\nYear\tAward\tCategory\tRecipient(s)\tResult\tRef(s)\n2016\tTeen Choice Awards\tChoice Movie: Sci-Fi/Fantasy\tCaptain America: Civil War\tWon\t[264][265]\nChoice Movie Actor: Sci-Fi/Fantasy\tChris Evans\tWon\nRobert Downey Jr.\tNominated\nChoice Movie Actress: Sci-Fi/Fantasy\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nChoice Movie: Chemistry\tRobert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Paul Bettany, and Chadwick Boseman\tNominated\nChris Evans, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Elizabeth Olsen, and Jeremy Renner\tNominated\nChoice Movie: Liplock\tChris Evans and Emily VanCamp\tNominated\nChoice Movie: Villain\tDaniel Brühl\tNominated\nChoice Movie: Scene Stealer\tChadwick Boseman\tNominated\nTom Holland\tNominated\nCritics' Choice Awards\tBest Action Movie\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\t[266]\nBest Actor in an Action Movie\tChris Evans\tNominated\nBest Actress in an Action Movie\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\n2017\tPeople's Choice Awards\tFavorite Movie\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\t[267]\nFavorite Action Movie\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\nFavorite Movie Actor\tRobert Downey Jr.\tNominated\nFavorite Movie Actress\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nFavorite Action Movie Actor\tChris Evans\tNominated\nRobert Downey Jr.\tWon\nFavorite Action Movie Actress\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nScreen Actors Guild Awards\tOutstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\t[268]\nAnnie Awards\tOutstanding Achievement, Character Animation in a Live Action Production\tCaptain America: Civil War - Spider-Man - Steve Rawlins, Ebrahim Jahromi, Cedric Lo, Stephen King, and Yair Gutierrez\tNominated\t[269]\nNAACP Image Awards\tOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture\tChadwick Boseman\tNominated\t[270]\nOutstanding Directing in a Motion Picture\tAnthony and Joe Russo\tNominated\nKids' Choice Awards\tFavorite Movie\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\t[271]\nFavorite Movie Actor\tRobert Downey Jr.\tNominated\nChris Evans\tNominated\nFavorite Movie Actress\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nFavorite Butt-Kicker\tChris Evans\tWon\nScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nFavorite Frenemies\tChris Evans & Robert Downey Jr.\tNominated\n#SQUAD\tChris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman\tNominated\nEmpire Awards\tBest Male Newcomer\tTom Holland\tNominated\t[272]\nBest Thriller\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\nBest Costume Design\tJudianna Makovsky\tNominated\nBest Visual Effects\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\nSaturn Awards\tBest Comic-to-Film Motion Picture\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\t[273]\nBest Director\tAnthony and Joe Russo\tNominated\nBest Actor\tChris Evans\tNominated\nBest Supporting Actor\tChadwick Boseman\tNominated\nBest Supporting Actress\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nBest Performance by a Younger Actor\tTom Holland\tWon\nBest Editing\tJeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt\tNominated\nBest Production Design\tOwen Paterson\tNominated\nFuture\nPotential Evans' solo film\n\nAccording to Feige, Civil War is the conclusion of the Captain America trilogy that began with The First Avenger.[274] While it is the final standalone Captain America film in Evans' contract with Marvel Studios,[275] Evans said in September 2015 that he was open to extending his contract past Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), the final films on his contract at the time.[276] In November 2018, Joe Russo said that Evans was \"not done yet\" with Captain America after Endgame.[277] In November 2019, when asked if he would reprise the role of Captain America, Evans responded, \"You never say never. I love the character. I don't know,\" and added, \"It's not a hard no, but it's not an eager yes either.\"[278] In January 2021, Evans was reportedly close to signing a deal to reprise the role of Captain America in at least one future project. Evans' involvement was said to be similar to how Downey had supporting roles in other film franchises, such as Civil War, after concluding the Iron Man film series with Iron Man 3 (2013).[279] Evans soon said the report was \"news to [him]\".[280] His potential return would be in a project separate from Captain America: Brave New World (2025).[281] The planned solo film was believed to have also included Hayley Atwell reprising her role as Peggy Carter; however Marvel Studios was unable to get the story for the film to a place to proceed with its development. Instead, by late 2024, the studio believed their next Avengers films, Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027), were better opportunities to revisit the characters; both Evans and Atwell were expected to reprise their roles in Doomsday,[282] with Atwell also expected to appear in Secret Wars.[283] Evans denied that he would be in Doomsday, saying he was \"happily retired\".[284] Evans also appeared in Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), reprising his pre-MCU role of Johnny Storm / Human Torch from 20th Century Fox's Fantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007).[285]\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Captain America: Brave New World\nMain articles: The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Captain America: Brave New World\n\nOne of Marvel Studios' Disney+ miniseries, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, was released in 2021, with Malcolm Spellman serving as head writer and Kari Skogland directing. It centered on Mackie's Sam Wilson / Falcon and Stan's Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, with Cheadle, Brühl, VanCamp, and Kasumba reprising their roles as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, Helmut Zemo, Sharon Carter, and Ayo, respectively, along with Georges St-Pierre as Georges Batroc from Captain America: The Winter Soldier.\n\nA fourth film, Captain America: Brave New World, was released on February 14, 2025,[286] directed by Julius Onah,[287] and written by Spellman, Dalan Musson (a series writer on The Falcon and the Winter Soldier),[288] and Matthew Orton.[289] It serves as a continuation of the events of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, focusing on Sam Wilson.[288] Mackie,[290] Danny Ramirez, Carl Lumbly, and Stan reprise their respective roles of Wilson, Joaquin Torres, Isaiah Bradley, and Barnes from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,[291] along with Tim Blake Nelson and Liv Tyler reprising their roles as Samuel Sterns / Leader and Betty Ross from The Incredible Hulk (2008).[291][292] Shira Haas appears as Ruth Bat-Seraph,[293] while Harrison Ford appears as Thaddeus Ross, replacing Hurt following his death in 2022.[294]\n\nNotes\n^ As depicted in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)[6]\nReferences\n^ \"Captain America: Civil War (12A)\".

It's Thursday, August 14, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.\n\n25 years ago Wikipedia was a dream. A wildly ambitious, probably impossible dream. A dream that came together piece by piece. Now, 65 million articles. 260,000 volunteers across the entire world. Here's to 25 years of knowledge, humanity, and collaboration at its best.\n\nMost readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.\n\n![Image 5: Wikimedia Foundation Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/donate/1/14/Wikimedia_Foundation_logo_-_wordmark.svg)\n\nProud host of Wikipedia and its sister sites\n\n How often would you like to donate? \n*   Once \n*   Monthly \n*   Annual \n\n Support Wikipedia year-round \n\n Thanks for your generous support \n\nPlease select an amount (USD)\n\nThe average donation in the United States is around$13.\n*   $2.75 \n*   $15 \n*   $25 \n*   $50 \n*   $100 \n*   $250 \n*   $500 \n*   Other amount Other \n\n- [x] I'll generously add a little to cover the transaction fees so you can keep 100% of my donation. \n\n Please select a payment method \n\n![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/donate/b/be/Trustly_logos_only.png)Online Banking \n\nCredit / Debit Card \n\nContinue Donate  one time Donate  monthly Donate  annually\n\nPlease select an amount (minimum $1)\n\nWe cannot accept donations greater than 25000 USD through our website.

It is the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and the 13th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from a screenplay by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America alongside an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Marisa Tomei, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, Martin Freeman, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures the team into two opposing factions—one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark (Downey).\n\nDevelopment of Civil War began in late 2013 when Markus and McFeely began writing the screenplay, which borrows concepts from the 2006 comic book storyline \"Civil War\" while also focusing on story and character elements from the previous Captain America films to conclude the trilogy. Following positive reactions to The Winter Soldier, the Russo brothers were brought back to direct in early 2014. The film's title and premise were revealed in October 2014, along with Downey's involvement as Stark; additional cast members joined in the following months. Principal photography began in April 2015 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia. It continued in the Metro Atlanta area before concluding in Germany in August 2015, with the film being the first to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras (for the film's central airport fight sequence). Visual effects were provided by nearly 20 different studios.\n\nCaptain America: Civil War held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 12, 2016, and was released in the United States on May 6, as the first film in Phase Three of the MCU. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $1.1 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2016, and received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances (particularly Evans and Downey), action sequences, and themes. A fourth film, Captain America: Brave New World (2025), is a continuation of Marvel Studios' Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), following Mackie's Sam Wilson as Captain America.\n\nPlot\n\nIn 1991, the brainwashed super-soldier James \"Bucky\" Barnes is dispatched from a Hydra base in Siberia to intercept an automobile carrying a case of super-soldier serum. In the present day, approximately one year after Ultron is defeated by the Avengers in the nation of Sokovia,[a] Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff stop Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in Lagos. Rumlow blows himself up, attempting to kill Rogers. Maximoff telekinetically diverts the explosion, accidentally destroying a nearby building and killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers in the process.\n\nThaddeus Ross, the U.S. Secretary of State, informs the Avengers that the United Nations (UN) is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Tony Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of politicians. Meanwhile, Helmut Zemo tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. At a UN conference in Vienna where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom T'Chaka's son, T'Challa, vows to kill. Informed by Sharon Carter of Barnes' whereabouts and the authorities' intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes—his childhood friend and war comrade—himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to Bucharest and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended by the Bucharest police and James Rhodes.\n\nImpersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to activate Barnes's brainwashing. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed \"Winter Soldiers\" are kept in cryogenic stasis. Unwilling to wait for authorization to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, Clint Barton, and Scott Lang to their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, Rhodes, Vision, and Peter Parker to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at Leipzig/Halle Airport, where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. As Rogers and Barnes are escaping, Rhodes is inadvertently shot down by Vision, and becomes partially paralyzed. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, and Romanoff goes into exile.\n\nStark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables Stark's armor. Rogers departs with Barnes, leaving his shield behind. Satisfied that he has avenged his family's deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers' actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts suicide, but he is stopped by T'Challa and taken to the authorities.\n\nIn the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. In a mid-credits scene, Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a post-credits scene, Parker explores the features of the web shooters built for him by Stark.\n\nCast\n(L-R) Nate Moore, Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers, Paul Bettany, Daniel Brühl, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, and Emily VanCamp at the London premiere\nChris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:\nThe leader of a faction of Avengers against regulation;[7][8] a World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality and frozen in suspended animation, before waking up in the modern world.[9][10] Director Anthony Russo described Captain America's character arc in the film as taking \"him from the most ra-ra company man\" to someone who is \"a somewhat willing propagandist\" to \"an insurgent\" at the end of the film.[11] Unlike the comics' Civil War, the film was never going to kill Rogers, as the directors thought that was \"an easy ending ...

Is this family broken permanently?\"[12] Evans' training regimen to get in shape for the role included weight lifting, which consisted of \"the classic bodyweight and bodybuilding stuff\", gymnastics and plyometrics, while staying away from cardio-based exercises, along with a high-protein diet.[13] His costume in the film received \"subtle changes to all the details and cut\" as well as its color, becoming a combination of the stealth suit from The Winter Soldier and the Avengers: Age of Ultron suit.[14]\nRobert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:\nThe leader of a faction of Avengers in support of regulation;[7][8] a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own invention.[15][16] Anthony Russo said that Stark's egomania allowed the writers \"to bring him to a point in his life where he was willing to submit to an authority, where he felt it was the right thing to do.\" Joe Russo added that because of the visions Stark saw in Age of Ultron, he now has a guilt complex which \"drives him to make very specific decisions,\" calling his emotional arc \"very complicated\".[11] Downey's personal trainer Eric Oram stated that the trick to pitting Rogers against Stark, \"is to show Iron Man using the 'minimum force' necessary to win the fight\".[17] Marvel initially wanted Downey's part to be smaller, but \"Downey wanted Stark to have a more substantial role in the film's plot.\" Variety noted that Downey would receive $40 million plus backend for his participation, as well as an additional payout if the film outperformed The Winter Soldier, as Marvel would attribute that success to Downey's presence.[18]\nScarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:\nAn Avenger allied with Stark;[7][8] formerly a highly trained S.H.I.E.L.D. spy.[19] Anthony Russo noted her torn allegiances in the film, saying \"her head is with Tony's side of things, but her heart is with Cap in a lot of ways.\"[11] Johansson added that Romanoff is \"looking to strategize her position, putting herself in a place where she is able to let the powers that be fight it out\" in order for her to \"have a better perspective of what's really going on.\"[20] Describing her character's situation after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Johansson said, \"I think that the Widow's past will always haunt her. She's trying to move forward, she's trying to pick up the pieces of her life.\"[21] She also said that Romanoff is at a point in her life where she can make choices herself, without having others have a hand in the decision process.[22] On the continuation of the relationship between Romanoff and Rogers from The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo said that they wanted to \"test it\" by having Romanoff point out to Rogers the mistakes the team have made and convince him \"that it might not be as black and white as he sees it\" and that the Avengers must \"find a way to work within the system so that [they] aren't disbanded.\"[11]\nSebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier:\nA physically enhanced brainwashed assassin allied with Rogers;[7][8] his best friend who reemerged after being thought to be killed in action during World War II.[23][24][25] This portrayal is an amalgam of Barnes and the Winter Soldier, with Stan saying, \"here's the guy when you merge the two. This is what came out. To me, he's never really going to be Bucky Barnes again. There's going to be recognizable things about him, but his path through the [experiences of] Winter Soldier is always going to be there, haunting him.\"[26] Because of this, the character has more lines in the film than in The Winter Soldier.[27]\nAnthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon:\nAn Avenger allied with Rogers;[7][8] a former pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack.[28] Wilson is aided by a robotic drone named Redwing.[29] Discussing the relationship between Wilson and Rogers, Mackie said, \"With Falcon and Cap, what's so great is there's a mutual respect. There's a soldier respect. What's great about ... [Captain America: Civil War] is you get to see their relationship grow,\"[30] adding, \"He respects and admires Cap because Cap earned his rank as opposed to sitting in an office and just delegating orders.\"[31] Joe Russo stated that the inclusion of Barnes to Rogers' side forces Wilson to question the dynamic and relationship he has with Rogers going forward.[11]\nDon Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:\nA close personal friend of Tony Stark's and an Avenger allied with Stark;[7][8] an officer in the U.S. Air Force who operates the War Machine armor.[32] Cheadle called Rhodes' appearance in the film a \"bit more intense and pivotal\" compared to his previous appearances.[33]\nJeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:\nA master archer allied with Rogers;[7][8] a retired Avenger and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.[14][34] On Barton's reasons for joining Rogers' side, Renner said, \"Cap was the first guy who called. Let's just get the job done so I can get home to the family,\"[31] along with feeling an obligation to side with Wanda Maximoff, since her brother, Pietro Maximoff, sacrificed himself to save Barton in Avengers: Age of Ultron.[35] On how he and Barton fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Renner said, \"I'm happy to be the ensemble. I'm not scratching or clawing to do a solo movie by any means ... I think [Barton's] a utility guy that can bounce around into other people's universes a little bit\".[36]\nChadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther:\nThe prince of the African nation of Wakanda allied with Stark[7][8][37][38][39] who gains enhanced strength by ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb.[40] Producer Kevin Feige explained that the character was included \"because we needed a third party. We needed fresh eyes who wasn't embedded with the Avengers and who has a very different point of view than either Tony or Steve.\" T'Challa is in the \"beginning phases of taking on\" the Black Panther mantle,[41] and appears in more than a cameo, with a full arc and character journey with \"his own conflict and his own people that he's looking out for.\"[42] Boseman did not audition for the role, instead having a \"discussion about what [Marvel] wanted to do and how I saw it and what I wanted to do.\"[43] T'Challa is torn between needing to live up to traditions and the legacy of his father and Wakanda, and how things need to happen in the present.[42] Boseman developed the Wakandan accent himself, and used it during the entire production \"whether he was on camera or not\",[12] while the Wakandan language was based on the Xhosa language, which Boseman was taught by John Kani (who plays T'Challa's father T'Chaka).[44] The Black Panther costume is a combination of a practical costume and visual effects, featuring a vibranium mesh weave similar to chainmail.[11] Costume designer Judianna Makovsky called the Black Panther costume \"difficult\" since \"you needed sort of a feline body, but it's hard and practical at the same time. You needed a feeling of some sort of ethnicity in there, but of a world [Wakanda] we weren't really creating yet, so you didn't want to go too far and say too much about that world.\" Additionally, Makovsky felt creating T'Challa's royal look was \"a bit of a challenge\", avoiding African robes after learning actual African royalty are generally \"educated in the West [and] get dressed in Savile Row.\"[45] Boseman signed a five-picture deal with Marvel.[46]\nPaul Bettany as Vision:\nAn android and Avenger allied with Stark;[7][8] created using the artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, and the Mind Stone.[32] Because the Vision was only created in the previous film, Age of Ultron, Bettany said, \"you see my character get born... He must be both omnipotent and yet totally naive at the same time. And experiencing the world in real time and his place in it. Is he going to be a force of good or a force of evil?\"[47] Bettany also said he was interested in exploring \"what it means to be human and what love is\" with the character, as \"The only way one can guarantee one's loyalty is love.\"[48] This is exhibited in the connection Vision begins to form with Wanda Maximoff, with Bettany commenting, \"They both have these new burgeoning powers that they don't understand ... I think he's worried that they're both dangerous. So he feels this real connection with her.\"[49] As the Vision has the ability to create a projected disguise, he chooses to dress similarly to Howard Stark's attache, Edwin Jarvis.[14]\nElizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff:\nAn Avenger allied with Rogers;[8][50] she can engage in hypnosis and telekinesis.[51] According to Olsen, the character is \"coming into her own and starting to understand and have conflict with how she wants to use her abilities.\"[52] As such, Maximoff's costume was \"relatively casual\" and \"more clothes-based than superhero-based\" according to Makovsky, since the Russos believed Maximoff was not a full-fledged Avenger yet.[53] When asked about the relationship between her character and the Vision compared to the comics, Olsen said, \"You learn a little bit more about what connects [Scarlet and Vision] in this film. And I think there's some really sweet moments between Paul and I, and it's more about how they relate to one another and their similarities just based on their superpowers.\"[54]\nPaul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:\nA former electrical engineer turned petty criminal allied with Rogers;[7][8] he acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[32][55][56] Rudd's suit \"is streamlined and more high-tech\" than the one seen in Ant-Man.[14] Ant-Man director Peyton Reed had discussed the character and the way that the Ant-Man production had shot certain sequences with the Russo brothers, saying, \"As we were doing [Ant-Man] and we were in post and they were getting ready to head out to Atlanta to do Civil War, we had a lot of conversations ... It's important because there's this continuity that has to happen in this universe.\"[57] On the decision to have Lang grow in size to become Giant-Man in the airport battle, Feige said, \"It was just a great idea to turn the tide of the battle in a huge, shocking, unexpected way. We have a lot of ideas for [Ant-Man and the Wasp], none of which are contingent upon revealing Giant-Man, so we thought this would be the fun, unbelievable unexpected way to do that.\"[58] Anthony Russo added that the transformation was the continuation of Lang's character arc from Ant-Man, saying \"He's just really impressed with Captain America, he just wants to deliver and he figures out a way to deliver where he might actually tear himself in half but he's willing to do it and it works.\"[59]\nEmily VanCamp as Sharon Carter:\nA former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Peggy Carter's niece who now works for the CIA and supports Rogers.[7][8][60][61] VanCamp stated that her character sides with Rogers because they both have \"similar moral compasses\".[62] On a potential relationship between Rogers and Carter as in the comics, Evans said, \"he's certainly open to it. Sharon is obviously relevant, but ... we don't have to tie it up in one movie. So they have time.\"[22] VanCamp added, \"We get to explore... I can't say we are going to that extent of it, but they are certainly getting to know each other.\"[62]\nMarisa Tomei as May Parker: Peter Parker's aunt.[63]\nTom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:\nA teenager allied with Stark;[64] he received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[65][66][67][68] Feige said that Parker would be torn between superhero ideologies, saying, \"Does he want to be like these other characters? Does he want nothing to do with these other characters? How does that impact his experience, being this grounded but super powerful hero? Those are all the things that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko played with in the first 10 years of his comics, and that now we can play with for the first time in a movie.\"[69] On aligning with Stark, Anthony Russo said that, despite entering the conflict after the two factions have formed and not having much political investment, Parker's choice comes from \"a very personal relationship\" he develops with Stark.[64][70] The Russos hoped \"to take a very logical and realistic and naturalistic approach to the character\" compared to the previous film portrayals. Anthony Russo added that the character's introduction had to fit \"that specific tonal stylistic world\" of the MCU, as well as the tone established by the directors in The Winter Soldier, saying, \"It's a little more grounded and a little more hard-core contemporary.\" That was \"coloring our choices a lot\" with Parker.[71] On the Spider-Man suit, Joe Russo described it as \"a slightly more traditional, Steve Ditko influenced suit,\" and that the film would explore the way the suit operates, particularly the mechanical eyes.[72] Holland chose not to read the whole Civil War script in order to avoid potentially leaking plot information publicly.[73] He was initially signed on for at least three films, not including his Civil War appearance.[74] Holland later expanded, saying he was signed for \"three Spider-Man movies and three solo movies\".[75]\nFrank Grillo as Brock Rumlow:\nFormer commander of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s counter-terrorism S.T.R.I.K.E. team who was revealed to be an agent of Hydra. On returning to the character, Grillo said \"He's a badass. He is just vicious. I like the idea that it's no holds barred. I was 15 pounds (6.8 kg) bigger when I did Cap 2, and I'll put another 15 pounds (6.8 kg) on to do Cap 3.\"[76] However, he cautioned that \"This movie is such a big movie with a lot of people in it, so you don't get as much of the time that you'd like to have.\"[77] Grillo stated that Rumlow's main objective in the film is to seek revenge—\"Whatever Rumlow was feeling as far as being torn between which side he should be on, which I think he was, is gone now.\"[78]\nMartin Freeman as Everett K. Ross:\nA member of the CIA's Joint Counter Terrorism Center and a character associated with Black Panther in the comics.[79][80][81] Freeman described Ross as someone who \"works for the American government ... [and] works in conjunction with the superheroes, and certain agencies that help to tame the superheroes' power\".[82] Feige added that Ross would appear briefly in the film, with the intent being to expand on the character's role in future films;[65] Freeman signed a three-film contract, for this film, Black Panther (2018), and its sequel (2022).[83]\nWilliam Hurt as Thaddeus Ross:\nThe United States Secretary of State and a former U.S. Army general.[29][32] Hurt, on returning to the MCU after appearing in The Incredible Hulk, said, \"I don't think it's a reprise, I think it's a new iteration completely,\"[84] adding, \"what [the writers have] done is they've taken a character ... and made a new version... a more modernized style.\"[85] Joe Russo added that Ross was the perfect character to use because he has \"a fanatical anti-superhero point of view\" and has \"become much savvier and more political and has put himself in a position of power, not unlike a Colin Powell. He's cornering the Avengers politically now, he's out-maneuvering them.\" Joe also added that Ross was included because the Russos felt it was important to make The Incredible Hulk \"relevant again within the [MCU]\" since it \"may have been forgotten about a little bit\".[11]\nDaniel Brühl as Helmut Zemo:[28][86]\nA Sokovian colonel-turned-terrorist who is obsessed with defeating the Avengers. Zemo, who goes by multiple names in the film,[65] does not wear his signature mask from the comics. Brühl said the version appearing in the film is \"loosely connected\" to the character from the comics and that was a reason he liked Marvel, as \"some of the characters and things they're dealing with always reference to current events so my character is from a different area than you would think.\"[87] Feige described the character as \"very much a product of the [Marvel] Cinematic Universe and all that has occurred within that universe up to this point\",[65] while Anthony Russo called him \"an everyman. His approach was: I've seen these guys fight enough to know I can't win. But what I can do is figure out ways to undermine them. He's emotionally driven and he finds a weak spot.\"[12] Brühl, who was cast due to his German accent, did not feel the role was a stereotype, saying, \"It's not a guy who's mean and sinister, but he's actually very clever—a very smart guy who does everything out of a very understandable reason and motivation.\"[88] Brühl also stated that Zemo may re-appear in future MCU films,[87] with Moore adding that, while Zemo has a purpose in this film, it is more to set up a future film.[89]\n\nAdditionally, John Slattery and Kerry Condon reprise their roles as Howard Stark and the voice of F.R.I.D.A.Y. from previous MCU films.[90][91] John Kani appears as T'Chaka, father of T'Challa and ruler of Wakanda;[90] Hope Davis appears as Maria Stark, Tony Stark's mother;[92] Gene Farber appears as Vasily Karpov, the Hydra official who oversaw the Winter Soldier program;[93] and Florence Kasumba portrays Ayo, a member of T'Challa's Dora Milaje.[94] Alfre Woodard, who portrays Mariah Dillard in the MCU TV series Luke Cage, briefly appears in the film as Miriam Sharpe, the mother of an American citizen killed in the battle of Sokovia. Woodard was suggested for the role by Downey before Marvel Studios learned of her casting in Luke Cage.[95] Jim Rash appears as a faculty member at MIT,[96][97] while Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a FedEx deliveryman,[97][98] and co-director Joe Russo cameos as Theo Broussard, a psychiatrist murdered by Zemo.[93][99] Damion Poitier, who appeared as Thanos in The Avengers before Josh Brolin was cast in that role for subsequent films, appears as one of Rumlow's mercenaries.[93]\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\n\nThis is the Civil War of the Cinematic Universe, which will be greatly inspired by the \"Civil War\" of the comic universe, but we have a very different continuity going on ... It's not about the secret identity thing, as much as it is about, overall, who reports to who, and who can agree to [an] oversight committee. Because as of now, in [Age of Ultron], there is no more security council, there is no S.H.I.E.L.D., obviously. Stark is paying for [the Avengers], Captain America is running it, and things occur that will make governments begin to question.\n\n—Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios[100]\n\nIn March 2014, Anthony and Joe Russo confirmed that they had signed on to return as directors for a third Captain America film, along with Chris Evans as Captain America, Kevin Feige as producer, and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely as screenwriters.[10][101] Markus and McFeely had been working on the screenplay since late 2013,[102] while the Russo brothers began work in February 2014.[103][104] The re-hiring of the directors, three months before the release of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, came as a result of Marvel executives being impressed with test screenings of that film.[10] Evans earned $15 million for the film.[105]\n\nIn an April 2014 interview, Joe Russo described the project as a continuation of the story from Captain America: The Winter Soldier: \"What's nice about the film is that ... it's a two-parter. There's a journey that the Winter Soldier goes on that isn't complete yet.\"[106] That month, Marvel announced a release date of May 6, 2016,[107] and Trent Opaloch, who was the cinematographer on The Winter Soldier, said he would return for the sequel.[108] In July, Markus and McFeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015.[109] The following month, they stated that they were looking to make the tone of the film \"an amalgam\" of The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier,[110] with the Russos likening it to a psychological thriller, citing Seven, Fargo, and The Godfather as influences,[8] along with westerns and Brian De Palma's films.[89] The Russos also stated that \"a good portion of [Civil War is] actually funnier than Winter Soldier\" with a more comedic tone and lighter moments throughout.[111]\n\nIn August 2014, the Russos stated that the film would be set \"a couple years\" after The Winter Soldier, and would continue to focus on Steve Rogers' relationship with Bucky Barnes as well as the political themes related to Captain America. Anthony stated, \"The character was invented for an explicitly political purpose. So it's hard to get away from that nature.\" The Russos also said that they would be \"bringing some new elements to the table that will give us a twist on Winter Soldier\",[112] and indicated that filming was scheduled to begin in Atlanta. They described themselves as \"ecstatic\" with a first draft of the screenplay submitted by Markus and McFeely, and also stated that the film's title would be announced \"in a month or so at most\", and that the concept and title for the film came from Feige, who had it \"for a while\".[103][113] In September, Joe expanded by saying the film would have another \"big idea that alters the universe as a whole in some way\" similar to S.H.I.E.L.D. falling in The Winter Soldier. The rest of the film, such as the characters, story, and tone, would be left open to the Russos' and writers' interpretations.[113]\n\nPre-production\n\nBy October 2014, Robert Downey Jr. had entered final negotiations to reprise his role as Tony Stark / Iron Man in the film. Downey was added in order for the film to adapt the 2006–07 \"Civil War\" comic book storyline written by Mark Millar, which pitted Iron Man against Captain America.[18] At the end of the month, it was confirmed that Sebastian Stan would return as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier.[23] A few days later, Marvel revealed that the film would be titled Captain America: Civil War, confirming Downey's appearance and announcing that Chadwick Boseman would appear in the film as Black Panther ahead of his own solo film.[15][37][38] Feige also confirmed that the film would be the first in the MCU's Phase Three slate of films.[100] Anthony Russo stated that adapting the \"Civil War\" storyline was not always the intended storyline and direction for the film when the brothers initially signed on to return as directors.[114] Markus expanded on this, saying the original concept for a third Captain America film \"never got to draft\", with Feige at some point telling the writing team to begin adapting \"Civil War\" around their original ideas. McFeely also added that, despite the shift in direction for the film, \"The central theme, even the way Zemo is operating, are from that [early] iteration.\"[115] The Russos revealed that, had negotiations with Downey to appear in the film failed, they would have used the Madbomb storyline from the Captain America comics, which was eventually used as a plot point in the first season of the Agent Carter TV series. The premise for the film would have centered on Zemo detonating the Madbomb, which would \"turn hordes of people into berserkers\" to present a physical threat to Captain America, while still pitting heroes against each other, as some would be zombified due to the Madbomb, to satisfy an \"emotional component\" for the film.[116]\n\nMcFeely said that the idea of basing a film on \"Civil War\" had \"been on and off the table for a while\" at Marvel Studios, explaining, \"it's a challenge to do it and make sure that all the characters that we've established, and everyone's established in the MCU are serviced and sound correct. Because there's a difference between the characters in \"Civil War\", which was written in 2006, 2007. The MCU doesn't exist [when it was written]. There isn't a Robert Downey Jr. or Chris Evans who has helped create the character[s] so we need to make sure that that template gets adjusted\".[117] Joe Russo added that the \"essence\" of \"Civil War\" was used, such as \"the concept of registration, the notion that heroes need to be either monitored or controlled because their power can be scary\" being applicable. Anthony Russo expanded, \"in a lot of ways [superhero registration] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist on that level. We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated. That's what the relationship between Steve and Bucky allowed us to do, to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or the other.\"[11] Executive producer Nate Moore added that \"it felt like it was kind of the right time\" to adapt \"Civil War\" given The Avengers, plus many of the Phase Two films (Thor: The Dark World, The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), all dealt with \"world-ending experiences. We felt like we had to tell the next step in that story, which is ... what is the world's reaction?\"[8]\n\nExecutives at Marvel Entertainment balked at the idea of Captain America and Iron Man coming to blows at the end of the film and wanted the Avengers to unite to fight Zemo and the supersoldiers at the Hydra base in Siberia instead. The Russos were not happy with this idea, with Joe Russo saying, \"There's nothing interesting about that film. We're not here to make that movie. We're not interested in telling another superhero story.\" Feige supported the Russos, who were going to leave the film if the changes were forced on them.[118] This prompted Walt Disney Studios head Alan F. Horn to back the Russos in making the film as originally intended, and led to oversight of Marvel Studios being moved from Marvel Entertainment to Walt Disney Studios in 2015.[119]\n\nIn November 2014, Daniel Brühl joined the cast in an unspecified role,[28] while Anthony Mackie and Frank Grillo were confirmed to return as Sam Wilson / Falcon and Brock Rumlow / Crossbones, respectively.[28][76] Following the November 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures' computers, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released stating that Marvel wanted to include Spider-Man (whose film rights are licensed to Sony) in the film, but talks between the studios concerning this were believed to have broken down.[120] However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios reached a licensing deal for the use of Spider-Man in an MCU film,[121] and reports indicated that the character would indeed appear in Civil War.[122][123] The Russos stated they were lobbying for months to include the character in the film.[111] In January 2015, Mackie revealed that, in addition to Atlanta, filming locations would include Puerto Rico and Berlin,[124] while the Russo brothers confirmed that Scarlett Johansson would return in the film as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow.[19] Editor Jeffrey Ford, who worked on The Winter Soldier, also signed on for Civil War.[125] In March 2015, Jeremy Renner was revealed to be reprising his role as Clint Barton / Hawkeye.[34] The next month, it was revealed that the film would be converted to 3D in post-production,[126] and that Brühl would be playing Helmut Zemo.[86] Additionally, Elizabeth Olsen revealed she would reprise her role in the film as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch.[51]\n\nFilming\nFilm set for Captain America: Civil War in Downtown Atlanta\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 27, 2015,[126][127] in Fayette County, Georgia, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios,[128] under the working title Sputnik.[129] Other filming locations in the Atlanta metropolitan area included the Buckhead district of Atlanta;[130] the Peachtree Christian Church in Midtown Atlanta;[131] Downtown Atlanta,[132] including an area near Philips Arena known as The Gulch, which served as the market in Lagos;[133] Norcross, Georgia;[130] Porsche's headquarters in Atlanta at Aerotropolis Atlanta, which served as the Avengers' headquarters in the film;[31] and the Atlanta Civic Center, which served as the IFID (Institute for Infectious Diseases) laboratory in Lagos; the latter's interiors doubled as MIT, and a third part was used for a Berlin location.[133] Trent Opaloch served as director of photography,[108] while Chad Stahelski, David Leitch, and The Winter Soldier stuntman Spiro Razatos were second unit directors.[134]\n\nIn early May, Marvel announced that Martin Freeman was cast in an unspecified role,[79] while also reprising roles in the film would be Paul Bettany as Vision, Don Cheadle as James Rhodes / War Machine, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter, and William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross.[32][60] Samuel L. Jackson, who appeared as Nick Fury in the two previous Captain America films, said he was \"surprised\" to discover that he would not be in Captain America: Civil War, after \"the Russo Brothers told [him he] was.\"[135] Moore stated that Fury was not included \"because he didn't add anything to the Civil War story they were telling\",[89] while Markus stated that they did not want him to choose any particular side because \"that's not his place in the universe\".[136] On each of the character's ties to the plot, Anthony Russo said that each character was examined on a personal level to see how they would respond to the idea of registration.[11] On the portrayal of each character, Joe Russo said that he and his brother had strong \"emotional\" and \"psychological connection[s] to [these] characters\" as children, adding, \"We want to reach into that and understand what elementally motivated you to love the character. That's what we try to bring out in the characters now.\" He also mentioned that they were \"trying to honor the feeling of naturalism and to honor the feeling of reality [with the film].\"[71]\n\nAfter the reveal of the film's full cast, many outlets and fans began referring to the film as \"Avengers 2.5 \", given the variety and ensemble nature of the cast, usually reserved for the Avengers films, and the fact that the film no longer felt like a Captain America-centric one, as with The Winter Soldier.[137][138][139][140][141] In response to this, Feige said, \"What's fun about Civil War though is, as you know from the comics, it's a very simple story. And it really has to be, to accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the Winter Soldier in ways I don't think people [will expect].... It's a very simple structure that allows you to have these amazing character interactions in a way that I don't think becomes overwhelming.\"[142] Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne / Wasp was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because \"there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice,\" saying Marvel was \"saving\" the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see \"her dynamic with Scott [Lang] in a way it could play out\".[143]\n\nAt the end of May, the Russo brothers, along with Feige and Pascal, held a screen test in Atlanta for six teenage actors that were being eyed for the role of Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the actors testing against Downey and Evans for \"chemistry\";[74][114][144] Tom Holland was cast as the character the next month, to also appear in a solo film.[66] The Russos \"were pretty vocal about who we wanted for the part\", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker in the comics, in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals,[65] with Anthony Russo believing Holland's age was one of the factors Sony was initially hesitant on Holland for the role.[145] They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background.[65] Downey felt of all the actors he tested with, Holland brought \"gravitas and the confidence to be able to take on the mantle\" of portraying Spider-Man.[145] At the time, Marvel did not confirm his involvement in Civil War,[67][146] due to being contractually obligated not to talk about his inclusion publicly.[65] The Russos discussed this, saying that the various business deals and agreements stemming from the sharing of the character rights, such as on a promotional and commercial level, \"were always lagging slightly behind how we were using the character. We were always in danger of upsetting the deal—there were still sensitive issues going on between the two studios that they needed to agree on.\"[147]\n\nHolland was confirmed to appear in the film in July 2015, by Jonathan M. Goldstein, one of the writers of the solo Spider-Man film,[68] and later by Entertainment Weekly from a set visit.[65] Jon Watts, director of Spider-Man: Homecoming, was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes, in order to \"see what they were doing with it, and that informed where we eventually took it,\" and provide \"ideas about this and that\",[148] such as what Parker's wardrobe and bedroom should look like, \"to make sure we were all on the same page so that [Homecoming] transitions seamlessly with theirs.\"[149] Anthony Russo stated that, despite Marvel telling them to have a \"plan B\" should the deal with Sony fail, the Russos never created one because \"it was very important to us to reintroduce\" Spider-Man in the film, adding, \"We only have envisioned the movie with Spider-Man.\"[150]\n\nBy the end of June, filming reached the halfway mark,[151] with production moving to Germany in early August.[152] Filming locations in Germany included the Olympic Stadium,[153] Potsdamer Platz,[154] Internationales Congress Centrum Berlin and Messe Berlin in Berlin,[153] and the Leipzig/Halle Airport in Schkeuditz.[153] Studio work was done at Babelsberg Studio.[154] Additional filming also took place in Puerto Rico and Norway,[32][124][155] and was scheduled to in Iceland.[32] Principal photography wrapped on August 22, 2015.[156][157]\n\nCaptain America: Civil War was the first film to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras, made in partnership with Arri, which was a customized version of the Arri Alexa 65. According to Joe Russo, approximately fifteen minutes of the film, the sequence where the two factions fight at Leipzig/Halle Airport, which was described as having \"incredible scale to it\" and referred to by the directors as the \"splash panel\", were shot with the cameras.[56][126] Opaloch noted that there were discussions late in pre-production to shoot the entire film with the Alexa 65 cameras. However, because of how close it was to the start of shooting as well as the idea being \"such a large-scale undertaking\", it was decided to only use them for the airport sequence, with the rest of film being shot on Arri Alexa XT digital cameras. For the airport sequence, Opaloch rigged the Alexa 65s to a Technocrane, a Steadicam, a dolly as well as a drone for flyover shots, which had its own dedicated team operating it. Because of the amount of resolution the Alexa 65s offered, Opaloch chose to use medium close-ups instead of close-ups, and for his wide shots, hold the shot a bit longer, \"maybe with a slight camera move that allows the viewer to take it all in.\"[158]\n\nPost-production\n\nIn September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, who plays Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his character was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed due to the end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not \"want to reveal where [he is] and why\" in this film.[159] Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, \"You've got to kind of choose your roster [of characters] depending on what kind of fight you want to have.\"[65] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear at the very end of the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, \"[The Hulk] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [Age of] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie.\"[160] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross \"was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix.\" Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.[161]\n\nThat November, Joe Russo stated that the theme of the film was betrayal, calling it \"extremely emotional. [The film] hinges on that emotion, and on a very personal level we didn't want [it] to become about politics and people arguing about platitudes. The third act is built around a very personal moment between [Captain America and Iron Man].\"[11] The Russos spent a great deal of time with Markus, McFeely, and Moore to ensure each character's emotional arc tracked through the entire film correctly, though realized that at some point \"you have to sacrifice logic for expediency\".[89] Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, \"This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months.\"[111] They also stated that the film would be doing \"a few reshoots\" in mid-to-late January.[111][162]\n\nIn February, Freeman's character was revealed to be Everett K. Ross,[80] and Gwyneth Paltrow was reported to have joined the film for the January reshoots, reprising her role as Pepper Potts;[163] however, in April 2016, it was revealed that Paltrow does not appear in the film,[164] with Anthony Russo explaining that Paltrow's contract with Marvel had ended after Iron Man 3, and \"we decided early on that we could make Pepper's break-up [with Tony Stark] have an emotional impact without actually having a scene with her.\"[12] On March 16, 2016, the Russos stated the film was \"about a week and a half away from\" completion,[165] with Joe adding that the film would have a post-credits scene, with the possibility for two or three total.[72] The film was completed on April 4, 2016.[166] Later in April, Alfre Woodard and Jim Rash were revealed to be cast in the film,[96] while Feige explained that Black Panther director Ryan Coogler contributed some dialogue for Black Panther in several scenes during reshoots.[167] At the film's premiere, it was revealed that Marisa Tomei appears in the film as May Parker, Peter Parker's aunt.[63]\n\nVisual effects\nOriginal (top) and postvisualization (bottom) shots of the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport\n\nNearly 20 visual effects studios worked on Captain America: Civil War including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, DNEG, Image Engine, Trixter, Cinesite, and The Third Floor amongst others. Lola VFX de-aged Downey Jr. in a scene that involved a younger holographic version of himself. Lola VFX's visual effects supervisor, Trent Claus said, \"In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr. Downey at the approximate age that we wanted to target, which was around the time of the film Less than Zero [when Downey was in his early 20s].\" He also noted the difficulty of the scene, due to it being close to 4,000 frames, and the fact that Downey was moving his head from side to side multiple times. Lola also worked on visual effects for the Vision.[155] The Third Floor extensively previsualized the film including the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport. Gerardo Ramirez, the Previs and Postvis Supervisor for The Third Floor said:\n\nWe visualized most of the major scenes in the film, some that were more story driven and some that were more action and story driven. The Russos used various methods for planning and they used each department for what it does best. The early edits were a combination of storyboards, previs and stunt performance clips. Stunts would choreograph the hand-to-hand action while the storyboards would be used for character story moments and previs was used for the big action scenes that involved many digital characters.[155]\n\nMethod Studios, which worked on 440 shots, was responsible for the helicopter sequence in the middle of the film and the climactic fight between Iron Man, Bucky, and Captain America. The original intent for the helicopter sequence was to place the scene next to the Paul-Löbe-Haus, where the Bundestag meets; however, the location was not allowed to be shown in the film, resulting in Method needing to create a full CGI background. For the climactic fight, one of the challenges for Method was getting the color of Iron Man's suit correct, opting to go with a more \"classic Iron Man look versus the really glossy car paint look\" that Iron Man had in the previous Avengers films. ILM was primarily responsible for the visual effects during the large-scale fight sequence at the airport, along with creating the digital assets for all of the characters. VFX supervisor Russell Earl, stated that the 20-minute scene grew to be an almost fully digital sequence explaining, \"We ultimately ended up replacing 99% of everything that was shot with the actors being lifted from the background. Originally both Spider-Man and Black Panther were planned to be photographed elements but we ended up almost completely replacing them.\" Luma Pictures, who also worked on The Winter Soldier, was assigned with completing shots of Bucky's arm and his metal brainwashing chair. They also worked on Bucky's escape from the task force lobby and designed Iron Man's new hybrid nanotechnology armor, which was an homage to the character's Bleeding Edge armor from the comics. Their work totaled approximately 200 shots.[155] Spider-Man was a digital double for all of his appearances, featuring his finalized suit; on-set, Holland wore a temporary Spider-Man suit that featured raised webbing and a different spider emblem, or a motion capture suit.[168]\n\nDesign firm Sarofsky once again worked on the film's main-on-end title sequence, having done the same for The Winter Soldier. The sequence used \"muted and mottled, burnt umber and steel blue and cold grey\" colors, which were stark contrasts to the sequences for The Winter Soldier and The First Avenger (the latter created by Method Design) which were \"a minimalist graphic approach, reducing the key players to silhouettes and paring the palette down to three colors\" and \"vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life, enticing the viewer to join the fray\", respectively. Creative director Erin Sarofsky noted one of the challenges for Civil War's sequence was \"to make it feel like a Captain America title sequence and not an Avengers sequence\" given the number of characters in the film.[169]\n\nMusic\nMain articles: Captain America: Civil War (soundtrack) and Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nHenry Jackman returned from The Winter Soldier to score the sequel.[170] He found the movie to be tonally different from the previous one, which necessitated a much more symphonic and orchestral score. This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as \"somewhat operatic and ... almost classical in its style\".[171] Though Jackman reprised and developed his themes for Captain America and the Winter Soldier from the previous film,[172][173] and introduced motifs for the new characters Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo,[171] he was wary of pushing the audience to one side of the central conflict or the other by using character-specific music; Jackman composed a new main theme for the film to represent the Civil War, \"a generic theme to balance everything out\",[174] \"toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes.\"[175] Jackman also wrote a thriller theme that appears whenever the mystery surrounding Zemo's plan is explored. This was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith.[172] The score was released on a soundtrack album by Hollywood Records on May 6, 2016.[176]\n\nMarketing\nPromotion\n\nIn early July 2015, Marvel began a viral marketing campaign for Ant-Man featuring Leslie Bibb, reprising her role from the Iron Man films as journalist Christine Everhart, reporting for the faux news program, WHIH Newsfront. In one program, Everhart discusses events leading to Captain America: Civil War.[177] The post-credits scene for Ant-Man featured footage shot by the Russo brothers for Captain America: Civil War,[178][179] showing Wilson and Rogers with Barnes in their custody, and unable to contact Stark because of \"the accords\"; Wilson mentions that he \"know[s] a guy\", implying Lang.[180] Feige explained that when the post-credit sequence appears in Civil War it may appear with \"different takes...different angles.\"[178] Stan said the scene was shot in early May 2015, and would appear in the middle of Civil War.[27] The first footage of the film debuted in August 2015 at the D23 Expo.[29] Additional footage was shown in September 2015 at the Asia Pop Comic Convention.[181] The footage shown at the D23 Expo and 2015 Asia Pop Comic Convention received an overwhelmingly positive response from the audiences.[182]\n\nThe first trailer for the film debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on November 25, 2015, and within hours became the number one trending topic on Twitter.[183] The trailer was viewed 61 million times in the first 24 hours of release, surpassing the 34 million views of Avengers: Age of Ultron's in 2014.[184] Scott Mendelson of Forbes called the trailer a \"doozy\" and noted that the early debut ahead of the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a \"good show\" on behalf of Disney as it was \"a way to not get lost amid the 8,000 other trailers debuting with Star Wars\". Mendelson also noted that based on the trailer's content, the film was being \"sold as Captain America 3, as opposed to Avengers 2.5 or Iron Man 4,\" which could help keep the film's box office expectations in check.[185]\n\nOn February 4, 2016, Marvel released their own version of the Facebook \"#FriendsDay\" video for Captain America. The video mirrors those created by Facebook for users to celebrate the anniversary of Facebook's founding, and features images of Captain America's \"friends\" the Winter Soldier, Thor, Falcon and Hawkeye. The video concludes with an image of Captain America and Iron Man being torn in half. Jennifer Konerman of The Hollywood Reporter called the video \"timely\" and its contents \"especially relevant considering the storyline\" of Civil War.[186] Three days later, a teaser debuted during Super Bowl 50, which received the most social media activity out of all the film trailers released that day.[187][188] Anthony Breznican of Entertainment Weekly said the footage \"actually feels a little more like a teaser [than a full trailer], since it shows some new shots, but really doesn't reveal much more about the story.\" Additionally, he felt the chanting \"unseen voices calling out, 'United...We...Stand' and 'Divided...We...Fall'\" had \"a football stadium vibe\", complimenting it appearing during the Super Bowl.[189] Mendelson added that Marvel did not need to follow the model used for The Winter Soldier during Super Bowl XLVIII of showing a longer trailer after the teaser since Civil War was \"frankly [a] higher-profile sequel.\" Overall, Mendelson felt the spot was \"only a little less low-key and small(er)-scale as the trailer that debuted in\" November 2015, and sold the \"real world\" aspect \"with character drama and mostly real-world action between would-be superheroes.\"[190]\n\nFour days later, on Valentine's Day, the Facebook campaign was continued, with Marvel creating a \"faux-status update\" for Captain America, showing his relationship status had changed to \"In a Complicated Relationship with Iron Man\".[191] At The Walt Disney Company's annual shareholder meeting in the Auditorium Theatre in March, CEO Bob Iger presented a clip from the film to \"generous applause\".[192] From March 7 to 10, Marvel released individual posters for characters in the film,[193] continued its Facebook campaign with two teaser videos showcasing the participants on \"Team Cap\" and \"Team Iron Man\", and released a second trailer.[194] The trailer was viewed close to 95 million times within the first 24 hours of release, surpassing the views achieved by the first trailer. In addition, 240,000 social media posts across Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Facebook, among others, were made related to the trailer, surpassing the 81,000 the Age of Ultron trailer received in 2014.[195] According to internet analytics firm ZEFR, the trailer was viewed over 62 million times from YouTube and Facebook over four days, making it the second most viewed trailer at the time, behind the 64.6 million views for the first Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer.[196] It also became the top trailer in 2016 through March 13, 2016, according to research firm ListenFirst, for receiving the most likes, retweets and other engagement on Twitter.[197] The trailer continued to be the top viewed trailer on YouTube and Facebook for three straight weeks according to ZEFR, receiving more than 96 million total views since its release.[198]\n\nMendelson called the trailer \"a textbook case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone out there who watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?\" He added that he was \"a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal,\"[199] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the \"courage\" to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the \"Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz\".[193] Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving \"us more explanation [and context] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man\",[200] and by including Spider-Man since \"there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven to go out to the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [Spider-Man] because it's the sort of value-added element that can make [a] difference\".[200] Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal \"alone makes the trailer\", describing it as feeling \"like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be.\"[201]\n\nWith the film seemingly continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered \"to what extent the whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron. As much great stuff as that movie has ... [it ultimately shows] the main hero foolishly/recklessly [bring] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and yet no one seems to care at the end ... What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be at a point where we really can't judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?\"[199] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was \"in an awkward place with Civil War\" regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would \"actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules\" as well. \"Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [should now be] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing on the other side of that wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?\"[201]\n\nAlso in March, Marvel, in partnership with the National Academy of Sciences Science & Entertainment Exchange, Dolby Laboratories, Broadcom, and Synchrony Bank, announced the \"Girls Reforming the Future Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields, to submit projects they feel can change the world and have far-reaching effects. Five winners would attend the world premiere at the Dolby Theatre, and receive a tour of Walt Disney Studios and a $500 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving an internship at Marvel Studios.[202] On April 10, Evans debuted an exclusive clip of the film during the 2016 MTV Movie Awards.[203] Throughout the month, the Russo brothers and the cast promoted the film in Paris, Beijing, Singapore, Berlin and London.[204] At the end of the month, Marvel released additional viral marketing videos of WHIH Newsfront, featuring Bibb once again reprising her role as Everhart. In the program, Everhart discusses with \"political analyst\" Will Adams, portrayed by Al Madrigal, the cost the Avengers bring for saving the world, and if they should have regulation from the government.[205] Additional Newsfront segments saw William Sadler reprise his role as President Matthew Ellis, including an \"exclusive\" interview and his reaction to the incident involving the Avengers in Lagos.[206][207] On May 2, 2016, Evans, Renner, and executives from Marvel rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in honor of the film's theatrical release.[208]\n\nMerchandise\n\nAt the 2015 Licensing International Expo, Disney Consumer Products announced that they would partner with licensees including Hasbro, Lego, Funko, Hot Wheels, Rubies, Mad Engine, C-Life, Jay Franco, Global Brand Group, Kellogg's, Hallmark and American Greetings to sell merchandise related to the film;[209] Coca-Cola,[210] Google, Samsung, Wrigley, Harley Davidson, Audi, Synchrony Financial, Pringles, Keebler, Pizza Hut, Pop Secret, Mouser Electronics, and Vivo, among other brands, were also licensees for the film.[211] Paul Gitter, senior VP of licensing for Marvel at Disney Consumer Products said that they will build off the success of licensed products for Avengers: Age of Ultron, including a focus on a celebration of Captain America's 75th anniversary, female apparel, healthy living and travel, and on marketing newer characters such as War Machine, Falcon, Vision, Black Widow and Black Panther. \"The Avengers team is both aspirational and hugely merchandisable, made up of multiple, unique heroes coming together with amazing skills, cool vehicles and a high tech headquarters,\" said Gitter. \"Captain America: Civil War not only gives us new storytelling for our favorite superheroes, but also introduces new ones allowing us to expand product lines for kids and fans.\"[209] As part of the $200 million marketing effort for the film, Harley Davidson created two customized motorcycles for the film, Audi debuted a commercial directed by the Russos featuring unreleased scenes from the film, while Pizza Hut debuted collectible boxes and Kellogg's, Pringles, and Keebler products featured virtual reality experiences. The lead-up to the film's release culminated in a massive online vote across Google, YouTube, and Twitter for either Team Captain America or Team Iron Man.[211]\n\nMarvel Comics released a four-issue comic prelude by writer Will Corona Pilgrim and artist Szymon Kudranski, beginning in December 2015, that adapted the events of Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.[212] On February 10, Marvel Comics released another comic prelude, a single-issue infinite comic set between The Winter Soldier and Civil War.[213] Written again by Pilgrim, the comic is told from the perspectives of Barnes, Rumlow, and Rogers, showing how each ended up where they begin Civil War. Art for each character's perspective is provided by Lee Ferguson, Goran Sudžuka, and Guillermo Mogorron, respectively.[214]\n\nRelease\nTheatrical\n\nCaptain America: Civil War premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 12, 2016,[202] and was screened at CinemaCon 2016 on April 13.[215] The film's Southeast Asia premiere was held on April 21 at the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore,[216] while the European premiere took place at Vue Cinemas in Westfield London on April 26.[217] The film was released internationally starting from April 27,[199] releasing in 61 countries its first weekend,[218] including the United Kingdom on April 29.[219] The North America release on May 6,[107] took place in over 4,200 theaters, of which 3,300 were in 3D, along with 378 IMAX theaters, 480 premium large-format, and 161 D-Box locations.[220] Internationally, the film opened in 955 IMAX theaters,[221] while South Korea saw Civil War open in an \"unprecedented\" 1,989 theaters.[222] Captain America: Civil War was the first film released in Phase Three of the MCU.[100] In September 2014, TNT acquired the cable broadcast rights for Captain America: Civil War to air two years after its theatrical release.[223]\n\nHome media\n\nCaptain America: Civil War was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on September 2, 2016, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and DVD on September 13, 2016. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and an exclusive preview of Doctor Strange.[224] The digital release comes with an exclusive \"mockumentary\" short film, Team Thor, directed by Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, which was originally screened at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 and showed what Thor was doing during the events of Civil War.[225][226] Captain America: Civil War was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on April 23, 2019.[227] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[228]\n\nReception\nBox office\n\nCaptain America: Civil War grossed $408.1 million in the U.S. and Canada and $745.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.153 billion.[4] By May 10, 2016, the film had grossed $737.8 million, surpassing the entire theatrical gross of its predecessor, Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($714.4 million).[229] It became the highest-grossing film of 2016,[230][231] the fourth-highest-grossing superhero film of all time,[232] and the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. and Canada of 2016, behind Rogue One and Finding Dory.[233] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $193.4 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it eighth on their list of 2016's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[3]\n\nUnited States and Canada\n\nTwo weeks ahead of its release, Fandango announced that the film outsold all previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films at the same point in the sales cycle,[234] and by its opening week, had reached the highest advance sales for a superhero film, representing 90% of the site's weekend ticket sales.[235] Captain America: Civil War earned $75.5 million on its opening day. The film's Friday gross included $25 million from Thursday previews, the second-highest Thursday preview gross among Marvel films, with $3.1 million of the $25 million coming from IMAX theaters, a new Marvel record. The film went on to earn $61.2 million on Saturday and $42.4 million on Sunday, for a total opening weekend gross of $179.1 million, the third-highest for a Marvel film and fifth-highest of all time. Of the $179.1 million, $16 million was from IMAX, the second best for an MCU film.[236] Initial projections for Captain America: Civil War had it earning between $175–200 million on its opening weekend,[237][238] with the projection being revised to $172–178 million after Friday.[236] BoxOffice called it \"the safest box office bet\" since Star Wars: The Force Awakens.[239] The film remained at number one in its second weekend,[240] and fell to second in its third, behind The Angry Birds Movie.[241] In its fourth weekend, Captain America: Civil War became the highest-grossing film of 2016 in North America,[242] and by June 17, 2016, became the first film of 2016 to surpass $400 million.[243]\n\nOther territories\n\nCaptain America: Civil War's opening in 15 countries on April 27, 2016, earned $14.9 million,[218] followed by $23.8 million the next day from 15 more countries, and $45.3 million two days later from 8 additional countries, for a three-day total of $84 million.[244] Its first weekend brought a total of $200.4 million,[221] after being projected to earn anywhere between $180–250 million,[245] with $9.4 million coming from IMAX. The film debuted at number one in all countries except Japan.[221] The film stayed at number one in its second weekend, earning $217 million, with existing territories seeing a 55% decline in earnings, while surpassing the entire international earnings of previous Captain America films, along with other MCU films. For IMAX in its second weekend, Captain America: Civil War earned $31 million, a new record for a day-and-date opening for a Marvel film.[246] By its third weekend, the film remained at number one in some territories, being overtaken by The Angry Birds Movie in others, and became the top film of 2016 and fourth-highest-grossing superhero film outside of North America.[247]\n\nIt set records for the largest opening day in Mexico ($7.3 million),[244] opening day of 2016 in France ($2.4 million),[218] the second-largest opening day in Brazil ($2.7 million)[244] and the United Arab Emirates,[246] the largest superhero opening day in the Netherlands,[244] and the largest superhero opening in Turkey and Ukraine.[246] It set opening weekend records in Brazil ($12.9 million), Mexico ($20.4 million), and the Philippines ($7.7 million), and was the second-largest opening weekend in Hong Kong ($6.9 million) and Thailand ($9.4 million). In the United Kingdom, the film earned the second-largest opening day and weekend of 2016 with $20.5 million, while France had the top 2016 opening weekend with $10.1 million. Germany had the best four-day opening of 2016 with $8.1 million, and Spain had the second-largest three-day opening of 2016 with $4.2 million.[221] For South Korea, the film was the largest non-Korean opening and largest Marvel opening in history.[222] China had the second best IMAX opening ($9.5 million), as well as the second-largest opening weekend for a Hollywood film ($95.6 million),[246] with the film eventually becoming the third-highest Disney release in the country after 10 days,[247] and the second largest superhero film.[232] Japan saw the film open third with $4.2 million, behind Detective Conan: The Darkest Nightmare ($5.3 million) and Zootopia ($4.8 million).[248] The film's largest markets were China ($190.4 million), South Korea ($62.8 million), and the United Kingdom ($53.2 million).[249]\n\nCritical response\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 90%, with an average score of 7.7/10, based on 431 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Captain America: Civil War begins the next wave of Marvel movies with an action-packed superhero blockbuster boasting a decidedly non-cartoonish plot and the courage to explore thought-provoking themes.\"[250] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 75 out of 100 based on 53 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[251] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an \"A\" grade on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 88% overall positive score and a 75% \"definite recommend\".[236]\n\nJustin Chang of Variety called it \"the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[252] Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Call it 'civil war' or call it brand extension; call it a 'cinematic universe' or a corporate behemoth—the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio's cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that's sure to satisfy devotees.\"[253] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote, \"This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything—and all—it wants to be.\"[254] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian called it, \"a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty.\"[255] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines, and only occasionally getting us (and by us I mean me) lost in the geek weeds.\"[256] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, \"If you live and breathe Marvel, this is one of the MCU's stronger offerings. If you are a spy coming in from the cold, the answer is not so clear.\"[257] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, \"Captain America: Civil War does not in any way transcend the conventions of the genre. On the contrary: It succeeds because it doesn't really try.\"[258]\n\nConversely, Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News said, \"Although it's called Captain America: Civil War, the latest Marvel movie is actually a supersized Avengers picture—overstuffed to bursting. And sometimes during its two and a half hour running time, it just goes bust.\"[259] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \"As a work of thought, Civil War is compromised, but at least there are thoughts to compromise. As an action film, it has its moments, but aside from the big opening sequence—the action scenes are a bit flat.\"[260] Andrew O'Hehir writing for Salon said, \"Much of Captain America: Civil War is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from Captain America: The Winter Soldier two summers ago.\"[261] While Nicholas Barber of the BBC gave the film a generally favorable review, praising both its visuals and action sequences, he criticized the fact that there was \"no cogent reason for any of [the Avengers] to be on one side or the other, which is why their inevitable dust-up feels like a game of dodgeball in a school playground.\"[262] Mark Millar, writer of the \"Civil War\" comic storyline on which the film was based, felt the film \"had a good opening twenty [minutes], but then I honestly can't remember what the movie was about.\" He also felt the film lacked levity, especially considering the Russo brothers' background in comedy.[263]\n\nAccolades\nYear\tAward\tCategory\tRecipient(s)\tResult\tRef(s)\n2016\tTeen Choice Awards\tChoice Movie: Sci-Fi/Fantasy\tCaptain America: Civil War\tWon\t[264][265]\nChoice Movie Actor: Sci-Fi/Fantasy\tChris Evans\tWon\nRobert Downey Jr.\tNominated\nChoice Movie Actress: Sci-Fi/Fantasy\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nChoice Movie: Chemistry\tRobert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Paul Bettany, and Chadwick Boseman\tNominated\nChris Evans, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Elizabeth Olsen, and Jeremy Renner\tNominated\nChoice Movie: Liplock\tChris Evans and Emily VanCamp\tNominated\nChoice Movie: Villain\tDaniel Brühl\tNominated\nChoice Movie: Scene Stealer\tChadwick Boseman\tNominated\nTom Holland\tNominated\nCritics' Choice Awards\tBest Action Movie\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\t[266]\nBest Actor in an Action Movie\tChris Evans\tNominated\nBest Actress in an Action Movie\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\n2017\tPeople's Choice Awards\tFavorite Movie\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\t[267]\nFavorite Action Movie\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\nFavorite Movie Actor\tRobert Downey Jr.\tNominated\nFavorite Movie Actress\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nFavorite Action Movie Actor\tChris Evans\tNominated\nRobert Downey Jr.\tWon\nFavorite Action Movie Actress\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nScreen Actors Guild Awards\tOutstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\t[268]\nAnnie Awards\tOutstanding Achievement, Character Animation in a Live Action Production\tCaptain America: Civil War - Spider-Man - Steve Rawlins, Ebrahim Jahromi, Cedric Lo, Stephen King, and Yair Gutierrez\tNominated\t[269]\nNAACP Image Awards\tOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture\tChadwick Boseman\tNominated\t[270]\nOutstanding Directing in a Motion Picture\tAnthony and Joe Russo\tNominated\nKids' Choice Awards\tFavorite Movie\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\t[271]\nFavorite Movie Actor\tRobert Downey Jr.\tNominated\nChris Evans\tNominated\nFavorite Movie Actress\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nFavorite Butt-Kicker\tChris Evans\tWon\nScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nFavorite Frenemies\tChris Evans & Robert Downey Jr.\tNominated\n#SQUAD\tChris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman\tNominated\nEmpire Awards\tBest Male Newcomer\tTom Holland\tNominated\t[272]\nBest Thriller\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\nBest Costume Design\tJudianna Makovsky\tNominated\nBest Visual Effects\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\nSaturn Awards\tBest Comic-to-Film Motion Picture\tCaptain America: Civil War\tNominated\t[273]\nBest Director\tAnthony and Joe Russo\tNominated\nBest Actor\tChris Evans\tNominated\nBest Supporting Actor\tChadwick Boseman\tNominated\nBest Supporting Actress\tScarlett Johansson\tNominated\nBest Performance by a Younger Actor\tTom Holland\tWon\nBest Editing\tJeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt\tNominated\nBest Production Design\tOwen Paterson\tNominated\nFuture\nPotential Evans' solo film\n\nAccording to Feige, Civil War is the conclusion of the Captain America trilogy that began with The First Avenger.[274] While it is the final standalone Captain America film in Evans' contract with Marvel Studios,[275] Evans said in September 2015 that he was open to extending his contract past Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), the final films on his contract at the time.[276] In November 2018, Joe Russo said that Evans was \"not done yet\" with Captain America after Endgame.[277] In November 2019, when asked if he would reprise the role of Captain America, Evans responded, \"You never say never. I love the character. I don't know,\" and added, \"It's not a hard no, but it's not an eager yes either.\"[278] In January 2021, Evans was reportedly close to signing a deal to reprise the role of Captain America in at least one future project. Evans' involvement was said to be similar to how Downey had supporting roles in other film franchises, such as Civil War, after concluding the Iron Man film series with Iron Man 3 (2013).[279] Evans soon said the report was \"news to [him]\".[280] His potential return would be in a project separate from Captain America: Brave New World (2025).[281] The planned solo film was believed to have also included Hayley Atwell reprising her role as Peggy Carter; however Marvel Studios was unable to get the story for the film to a place to proceed with its development. Instead, by late 2024, the studio believed their next Avengers films, Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027), were better opportunities to revisit the characters; both Evans and Atwell were expected to reprise their roles in Doomsday,[282] with Atwell also expected to appear in Secret Wars.[283] Evans denied that he would be in Doomsday, saying he was \"happily retired\".[284] Evans also appeared in Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), reprising his pre-MCU role of Johnny Storm / Human Torch from 20th Century Fox's Fantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007).[285]\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Captain America: Brave New World\nMain articles: The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Captain America: Brave New World\n\nOne of Marvel Studios' Disney+ miniseries, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, was released in 2021, with Malcolm Spellman serving as head writer and Kari Skogland directing. It centered on Mackie's Sam Wilson / Falcon and Stan's Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, with Cheadle, Brühl, VanCamp, and Kasumba reprising their roles as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, Helmut Zemo, Sharon Carter, and Ayo, respectively, along with Georges St-Pierre as Georges Batroc from Captain America: The Winter Soldier.\n\nA fourth film, Captain America: Brave New World, was released on February 14, 2025,[286] directed by Julius Onah,[287] and written by Spellman, Dalan Musson (a series writer on The Falcon and the Winter Soldier),[288] and Matthew Orton.[289] It serves as a continuation of the events of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, focusing on Sam Wilson.[288] Mackie,[290] Danny Ramirez, Carl Lumbly, and Stan reprise their respective roles of Wilson, Joaquin Torres, Isaiah Bradley, and Barnes from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,[291] along with Tim Blake Nelson and Liv Tyler reprising their roles as Samuel Sterns / Leader and Betty Ross from The Incredible Hulk (2008).[291][292] Shira Haas appears as Ruth Bat-Seraph,[293] while Harrison Ford appears as Thaddeus Ross, replacing Hurt following his death in 2022.[294]\n\nNotes\n^ As depicted in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)[6]\nReferences\n^ \"Captain America: Civil War (12A)\".

It's Thursday, August 14, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.\n\n25 years ago Wikipedia was a dream. A wildly ambitious, probably impossible dream. A dream that came together piece by piece. Now, 65 million articles. 260,000 volunteers across the entire world. Here's to 25 years of knowledge, humanity, and collaboration at its best.\n\nMost readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.\n\n![Image 5: Wikimedia Foundation Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/donate/1/14/Wikimedia_Foundation_logo_-_wordmark.svg)\n\nProud host of Wikipedia and its sister sites\n\n How often would you like to donate? \n*   Once \n*   Monthly \n*   Annual \n\n Support Wikipedia year-round \n\n Thanks for your generous support \n\nPlease select an amount (USD)\n\nThe average donation in the United States is around$13.\n*   $2.75 \n*   $15 \n*   $25 \n*   $50 \n*   $100 \n*   $250 \n*   $500 \n*   Other amount Other \n\n- [x] I'll generously add a little to cover the transaction fees so you can keep 100% of my donation. \n\n Please select a payment method \n\n![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/donate/b/be/Trustly_logos_only.png)Online Banking \n\nCredit / Debit Card \n\nContinue Donate  one time Donate  monthly Donate  annually\n\nPlease select an amount (minimum $1)\n\nWe cannot accept donations greater than 25000 USD through our website.

The film was directed by [Jon Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Watts \"Jon Watts\") from a screenplay by the writing teams of [Jonathan Goldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Goldstein_(filmmaker) \"Jonathan Goldstein (filmmaker)\") and [John Francis Daley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Francis_Daley \"John Francis Daley\"), Watts and [Christopher Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Ford_(screenwriter) \"Christopher Ford (screenwriter)\"), and [Chris McKenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_McKenna_(writer) \"Chris McKenna (writer)\") and [Erik Sommers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Sommers \"Erik Sommers\").

The following June, Holland was cast as the title character, and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of [Tony Stark / Iron Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stark_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"). Principal photography began in June 2016 at [Pinewood Atlanta Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinewood_Atlanta_Studios \"Pinewood Atlanta Studios\") in [Fayette County, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayette_County,_Georgia \"Fayette County, Georgia\"), and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.\n\n_Spider-Man: Homecoming_ premiered in [Hollywood, Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles \"Hollywood, Los Angeles\"), on June 28, 2017, and was released in the United States on July 7, as part of [Phase Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Three \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three\") of the MCU. _Homecoming_ grossed over $880 million worldwide, becoming the second-most-successful Spider-Man film and the [sixth-highest-grossing film of 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_in_film#Highest-grossing_films \"2017 in film\"). It received praise for the light tone, its focus on Parker's high school life, and the performances, particularly of Holland and Keaton. Two sequels have been released: _[Spider-Man: Far From Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:\\_Far\\_From\\_Home \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\")_ (2019) and _[Spider-Man: No Way Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:\\_No\\_Way\\_Home \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\")_ (2021). A new trilogy of live-action films from Sony and Marvel Studios is in development.\n\nFollowing the [Battle of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_New_York_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Battle of New York (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in 2012,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-5)[Adrian Toomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Toomes_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Adrian Toomes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the [Department of Damage Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damage_Control_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Damage Control (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") (DODC), a partnership between [Tony Stark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stark_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") and the [U.S. government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal government of the United States\"). Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the [Chitauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitauri_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons, including a flying [Vulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Vulture (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") suit Toomes uses to steal Chitauri power cells.\n\nEight years later,[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-8) after being drafted into the [Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") by Stark to help with an internal dispute in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany \"Germany\"),[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-11)[Peter Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Parker_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") resumes his studies at the [Midtown School of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_School_of_Science_and_Technology \"Midtown School of Science and Technology\") when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full-time Avenger. Parker quits his school's [academic decathlon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_decathlon \"Academic decathlon\") team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. His best friend, [Ned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Leeds_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Ned Leeds (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"), eventually discovers his secret identity.\n\nParker comes across Toomes's associates [Jackson Brice / Shocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Brice_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Jackson Brice (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") and [Herman Schultz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Schultz_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Herman Schultz (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") selling weapons to local criminal [Aaron Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Davis_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Aaron Davis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"). Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes in the Vulture suit and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.\n\nParker and Ned study a weapon Brice left behind, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to [Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland \"Maryland\"), Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\") for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a DODC truck but is trapped inside, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, he races to the [Washington Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument \"Washington Monument\"), where the core is activated and explodes, trapping Ned and their friends in an elevator. Parker saves them, including his classmate and crush [Liz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Liz (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"). Days later, in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), aboard the [Staten Island Ferry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island_Ferry \"Staten Island Ferry\"), Parker captures Toomes's new buyer [Mac Gargan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Gargan_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Mac Gargan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers, but confiscates his suit as punishment for his recklessness.\n\nParker returns to his high school life and asks Liz to go to the [homecoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homecoming \"Homecoming\") dance with him. On the night of the dance, he discovers that Toomes is Liz's father. Deducing Parker's secret identity, Toomes threatens him. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a DODC plane transporting weapons from [Avengers Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_Tower_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Avengers Tower (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") to the team's [new headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_Compound_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in Upstate New York. He leaves the dance and dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit. Though he is ambushed outside by Schultz, he defeats him with Ned's help. He races to Toomes's lair, where Toomes attacks Parker, destroying the building's support columns, and leaves Parker to die, trapped in the rubble of the collapsed building. Gaining the motivation from his inner strength, Parker escapes and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach at [Coney Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island \"Coney Island\"). He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes's life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes. Parker leaves Toomes for the police along with the plane's cargo.

They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-GoldsteinDaleyCS-22) Daley said the film was about Parker \"finding his place\" in the MCU, with the writing team wanting the film to focus on him \"coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses\", such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the [Washington Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument \"Washington Monument\"). Daley noted, \"Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie.\"[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-DaleyGoldsteinTHR2-20) The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan \"Manhattan\") because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as \"the suburbs, on a golf course, the [Staten Island Ferry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island_Ferry \"Staten Island Ferry\"), [Coney Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island \"Coney Island\"), and even Washington, D.C.\" One of the first sequences they pitched was \"seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. ... you're familiar with the sort of areas he's been in, [so] why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven't seen before?\"[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-GoldsteinDaleyCS-22) The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, \"low-stakes\" approach than previous films, which avoided having to explain why the Avengers were not helping, since a world-threatening problem would logically require the \"big guys\".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-DaleyGoldsteinTHR2-20)\n\nMarvel encouraged Daley and Goldstein to express their own sense of humor in the script, with Daley saying, \"When you're seeing the world through the eyes of a fun, funny kid, you can really embrace that voice, and not give him the cookie-cutter one-liners that you're so accustomed to hearing from Peter Parker.\" Inspired by their experiences working on [sitcoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom \"Sitcom\"), the writers also looked to create \"a network of strong characters\" to surround Parker with in the film.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-GoldsteinDaleyCS-22) In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a [coming-of-age story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming-of-age_story \"Coming-of-age story\") to see the growth of Parker, citing _[Can't Buy Me Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can%27t\\_Buy\\_Me\\_Love\\_(film) \"Can't Buy Me Love (film)\")_ (1987), _[Say Anything...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say\\_Anything... \"Say Anything...\")_ (1989), and _[Almost Famous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost\\_Famous \"Almost Famous\")_ (2000) as some of his favorite films in that genre.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-WattsOct2015-137) It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-WattsJun2017-138) Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and \"came to a new realization\" about the character's original popularity, feeling that he introduced a new perspective to the comics that had already established \"a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person's perspective on it\". He felt that this was also the responsibility of this film since it had to introduce Spider-Man to the already established MCU.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-WattsScreenCrush-119) Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were _[Ultimate Spider-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate\\_Spider-Man \"Ultimate Spider-Man\")_ (2000-2011) and _[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man\\_Loves\\_Mary\\_Jane \"Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane\")_ (2004-2009).[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-WattsJun2017-138) In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-Scholl-139)\n\n[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Jon_Watts_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg/250px-Jon_Watts_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jon_Watts_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg)\n\nWatts promoting _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con\n\nWatts wanted to heavily pre-visualize the film, especially its action sequences, as he does on all his films. For _Homecoming_, Watts worked with a team to \"figure out the visual language for the action sequences and ... try stuff out before\" filming began to help Watts practice given his lack of experience working on large-scale films. For the \"web-slinging\" sequences, Watts wanted to avoid the big \"swoopy\" camera moves that had been previously used and instead \"keep it all as grounded as possible. So, whether it was shooting with a drone camera or a helicopter or a cable-cam, or even just handheld, up on a roof chasing after him, I wanted it to feel like we were there with him.\"[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-WattsJun2017-138)\n\nIn January 2016, Sony shifted the film's release date from July 28, 2017, to July 7, 2017,[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-NewReleaseDate-140) and said the film would be digitally remastered for [IMAX 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX_3D \"IMAX 3D\") in post-production.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-IMAX3D-141)[J.

This included the _[Daily Bugle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily\\_Bugle \"Daily Bugle\")_, with co-producer [Eric Hauserman Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hauserman_Carroll \"Eric Hauserman Carroll\") saying, \"We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn't want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a _Daily Bugle_, we want to do it in a way that feels contemporary\".[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-/FilmSetVisitPg1-118) This also included the character [Mary Jane Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jane_Watson \"Mary Jane Watson\"), but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials \"MJ\" as a nod to that character.

Stark also builds in a \"training wheels\" protocol, to initially limit Parker's access to all of its features.

He then started brainstorming other [public service announcements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service_announcement \"Public service announcement\") (PSA) starring Captain America, about \"just anything you could think of, we had poor Captain America do it\". Watts said that many of the additional PSA videos would be featured on the home media of the film.[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-CapVideos-187) According to Goldstein, additional videos featuring other [Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") were planned at some point.[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-AdditionalEducationalVideos-188) Watts confirmed that the company Stark creates that leads Toomes on his villainous path in the film is [Damage Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damage_Control_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Damage Control (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\"), which Watts felt \"just fit in with our overall philosophy with the kind of story we wanted to tell\" and created a lot of practical questions Watts wanted to use \"to drive the story\".[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-DamageControl-62)\n\nThe film features multiple [post-credit scenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credit_scene \"Post-credit scene\").[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-DamageControl-62)[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-PostCreditScenes-189) The first gives the Vulture a chance at redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this \"was a really interesting thing in the development of the story. You couldn't just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family.\" The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a [meta-referential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-reference \"Meta-reference\") joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene.[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-PostCreditScenes2-190) This was a \"last-minute addition\" to the film.[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-PostCreditScenes3-191) Watts completed work on _Homecoming_ at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, \"You assume you'll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn't really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to.\"[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-WattsJun2017-138) That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school,[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-StarrRole-79) and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-MarshallGreenShocker-192)\n\nIn July, Feige discussed specific moments in the film, including an homage to _[The Amazing Spider-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Amazing\\_Spider-Man \"The Amazing Spider-Man\")_ vol. 1 [issue 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_This_Be_My_Destiny...! \"If This Be My Destiny...!\") (1966) where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige \"wanted to see in a movie for a long, long time\".[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-FeigeFandangoJul2017-193) Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, \"We have [Parker] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem.\"[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-DaleyGoldsteinTHR2-20) Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of the first MCU film _[Iron Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron\\_Man\\_(2008\\_film) \"Iron Man (2008 film)\")_ (2008) when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, \"What does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique.\"[[190]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-FeigeCBJul2017-194) Goldstein added that it \"diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [and] lets her become part of what's really his life.\"[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-DaleyGoldsteinTHR2-20) Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, feeling that if it did not work, the film would not work. The team \"worked backwards and forwards from that moment ... You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [and it] doesn't seem like something out of left field\".[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-FeigeFandangoJul2017-193) Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, \"more than anything else, [what] I was looking forward to, and I got to have a lot of fun shooting that stuff\".[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-PostCreditScenes2-190) Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were \"giddy when we first came up with [that twist], because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time\".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-DaleyGoldsteinTHR2-20)\n\n[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/Grand_Central_Terminal_VFX_in_Spider-Man_Homecoming.jpg/250px-Grand_Central_Terminal_VFX_in_Spider-Man_Homecoming.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Grand_Central_Terminal_VFX_in_Spider-Man_Homecoming.jpg)\n\nTrixter used a [LIDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDAR \"LIDAR\") scan of [Grand Central Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Terminal \"Grand Central Terminal\") from _The Avengers_ to help create their CGI version (bottom), adding to the elements filmed on set (top).[[191]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-ArtofVFX-195)\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![Image 5: video icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/20px-Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png)[Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Homecoming End Credits Final Main on End Title Sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v7wmDpszJw) presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\") video from [Perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception_(visual_effects_company) \"Perception (visual effects company)\")'s channel |\n\nVisual effects for the film were completed by [Sony Pictures Imageworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Imageworks \"Sony Pictures Imageworks\"), [Industrial Light & Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic \"Industrial Light & Magic\"), [Luma Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_Pictures \"Luma Pictures\"), [Digital Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Domain \"Digital Domain\"), [Cantina Creative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantina_Creative \"Cantina Creative\"), Iloura, Trixter,[[192]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-VFXVendors-196) and [Method Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_Studios \"Method Studios\").[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-FXGuide-171) Executive producer [Victoria Alonso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Alonso \"Victoria Alonso\") initially did not want Imageworks, which worked on all previous Spider-Man films, to work on _Homecoming_, in order to give it a different look than those earlier films. She changed her mind after seeing what she called \"phenomenal\" test material from the vendor.[[193]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-THRVFXAug2017-197) The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by [Perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception_(visual_effects_company) \"Perception (visual effects company)\").[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-Perception-198)\n\nTrixter contributed over 300 shots for the film, including the opening scene at [Grand Central Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Terminal \"Grand Central Terminal\"), the sequence that retells the events of _Civil War_ from Parker's perspective, the sequence where Toomes takes Liz and Parker to the dance, the school battle between Parker and Schultz, and the scene around and within the Avengers compound. They also worked on both Spider-Man suits and the spider tracer. Trixter created additional salvage workers to populate the Grand Central scene, whose clothes and proportions were able to be altered to create variation. For the battle between Parker and Schultz, Trixter used an all-digital Spider-Man in his homemade suit, which came from Imageworks, with Trixter applying a rigging, muscle, and cloth system to it \"to mimic the appearance of the rather loose training suit\". They also created the effects for Schultz's gauntlets and had to change the setting from the Atlanta set to Queens, by using a CGI school and adding 360 degrees of matte paintings for the mid to far-distance elements. Trixter received concept art and basic geometry that was used previously for the Avengers compound, but ended up remodeling it for the way it appears in _Homecoming_. Models and textures for Spider-Man's Avengers costume were created by [Framestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framestore \"Framestore\") for use in a future MCU film, with Trixter creating the vault that it appears in. Trixter VFX supervisor Dominik Zimmerle said the idea was \"to have a clean, high tech, presentation Vault for the new suit. It should appear distinctively 'Stark' originated\".[[191]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-ArtofVFX-195)\n\nDigital Domain worked on the Staten Island Ferry battle, creating the CGI versions of Spider-Man, the Vulture suit, Iron Man, and Spider-Man's drone. Digital Domain was able to [LIDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDAR \"LIDAR\") an actual Staten Island Ferry, as well as the version created on set, to help with creating their digital version.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-FXGuide-171) Lou Pecora, visual effects supervisor at Digital Domain, called that sequence \"brutal\" because \"the way they were shot, it was lit to be a certain time of day, and afterwards it was decided to change that time of day\".[[195]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-CNETVFX-199) Sony Pictures Imageworks created much of the third act of the film when Parker confronts Toomes on the plane and beach in his homemade suit, and Toomes is in an upgraded Vulture suit. Some elements of Vulture's first suit were shared with Imageworks, but the remainder were created by them \"based on a maquette\". For the plane's cloaking ability, Imageworks was inspired by [Adaptiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptiv \"Adaptiv\") IR Camouflage tank cloaking system by [BAE Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems \"BAE Systems\"), which \"uses a series of titles to cloak against infrared\". For their web design, which was based on the one created for _Civil War_, Digital Domain referenced polar bear hair because of its translucent nature. Imageworks also looked to the _Civil War_ webs, as well as to those they had created for previous Spider-Man films, in which \"the web[s] had [...] tiny barbs that aided in hooking on to things\". For this film, they \"dialed back the barbs\" to line up more closely with the other web designs created for this film.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-FXGuide-171) Method Studios worked on the Washington Monument sequence.[[193]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-THRVFXAug2017-197) Iron Man's armor in the film, the Mark XLVII, is a recolored version of the MK XLVI armor introduced in _Civil War_; this was done because Sony did not have the budget to create a new Iron Man suit. Feige requested the color scheme resemble the [Ultimate Iron Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(Ultimate_Marvel_character) \"Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)\") armor from the comics.[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-IronManArmor-200)\n\nWhile promoting _[Doctor Strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor\\_Strange\\_(2016\\_film) \"Doctor Strange (2016 film)\")_ in early November 2016, Feige accidentally revealed that [Michael Giacchino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Giacchino \"Michael Giacchino\"), who composed the music for that film, would compose the score for _Homecoming_ as well. Giacchino soon confirmed this himself.[[197]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-Giacchino-201) Recording for the soundtrack began on April 11, 2017.[[198]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-SoundtrackRecording-202) The score includes the [theme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(theme_song) \"Spider-Man (theme song)\") from the [1960s animated series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(1967_TV_series) \"Spider-Man (1967 TV series)\").[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-1960sThemeSong-203) The soundtrack was released by [Sony Masterworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Masterworks \"Sony Masterworks\") on July 7, 2017.[[200]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-Soundtrack-204)\n\nWatts, Holland, Batalon, Harrier, Revolori, and Zendaya appeared at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to show an exclusive clip of the film,[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-SDCC2016-39)[[201]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-SDCC2016CBR-205) which also had a panel at [Comic Con Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Con_Experience \"Comic Con Experience\") 2016.[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-CCXPPanel-206) The first trailer for _Homecoming_ premiered on _[Jimmy Kimmel Live!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy\\_Kimmel\\_Live! \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\")_ on December 8, 2016,[[203]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-Kimmel-207) and was released online alongside an international version, which Feige thought was different enough that \"it would be fun for people to see both.\"[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-USATodayDec2016-21) The shots of Vulture descending through a hotel atrium and Spider-Man swinging with Iron Man flying beside him were created specifically for the trailer. Watts explained that the Vulture shot was created for Comic-Con and \"was never meant to be in the movie\", but he was able to repurpose the angle for Vulture's reveal in the film. The Spider-Man and Iron Man shot was created because the marketing team wanted a shot of the two together, and existing shots \"just didn't look that great\" then. The trailer shot used a background plate taken when filming the subway in Queens.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-WattsScreenCrush-119) The two trailers were viewed over 266 million times globally within a week.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-DeadlineWknd1-107)\n\nOn March 28, 2017, a second trailer debuted after screening at CinemaCon 2017 the night before.[[204]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming#cite_note-CinemaCon2017Trailer-208) Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at _[BoxOffice.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoxOffice\\_(magazine) \"BoxOffice (magazine)\")_, noted that the new _[Justice League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice\\_League\\_(film) \"Justice League (film)\")_ trailer had received more [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter \"Twitter\") mentions in that week but there was \"clearer enthusiasm for _Spider-Man_\".

Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan deliver standout performances as T'Challa and Killmonger, respectively. The film explores themes of identity, power, and responsibility, receiving critical acclaim. However, some find the plot formulaic and characters one-dimensional. Criticisms include pacing issues, predictability, and over-reliance on CGI. A few argue the film's cultural impact overshadows its narrative and technical flaws.\nAI-generated from the text of user reviews\nAction sequences\nCharacter development\nCostume design\nPerformance\nSocial commentary\nSoundtrack\nWorldbuilding\nThin story\nFeatured reviews\nHermanNebelwerfer (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52800150/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_uname)\nOverrated (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/reviews/?featured=rw4630477&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_hd)\nLasted an hour before I bailed. I like the cast but the movie is done in by terrible writing that most of the actors could not overcome. Halfway through the film and there's little to no character development. I have no reason to care about 99.9% of the people on the screen. As a huge fan of the preceding films, I expected much more from Black Panther. Very disappointing. The hype and over-the-top praise of this movie is misplaced.\n8\nuniverse1701 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68962574/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_uname)\nGreat addition to the MCU. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/reviews/?featured=rw4065825&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_hd)\nA great addition to the MCU. Great acting, beautiful visuals and some intense action. First impressive thing I noticed was its rich attention to detail in world building and its characters. My only criticism, I would have like to have seen more of the Killmonger character, as I feel they didn't go far enough with him. Over-all, this is a fun and enjoyable movie with action, comedy, drama. There are some complex social political overtones mixed in, but it never feels heavy handed, and I feel that the over-all message is positive for humanity as a whole. If this type of movie isn't your cup of tea, fair enough, but if you are on the fence about watching due to pre-conceived notions about its content and message, I would recommend you give it a try, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.\n8\nashil-john- (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4767493/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_uname)\nGoodbye, King. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/reviews/?featured=rw6039053&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_hd)\nThanks for a wonderful performance even while battling cancer. Few people could've done what you did and even fewer could've done it with such panache.\nThis movie doesn't deserve a 10 star rating, I agree, but it doesn't deserve all those 1's and 2's from the haters either. It remains to this day, one of the best standalone Marvel movies ever made.\nYou'll be sorely missed.\n8/10\n8\naclaurence (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur89000496/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_uname)\nConfused by the hate (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/reviews/?featured=rw4197360&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_hd)\nI'd heard this movie was good and finally got around to watching it. When it was done I looked on IMDB and saw hundreds of 1 and 2 star reviews that I can only fathom were written by people who would hate anything with an almost entirely black cast that focused on a fictional or real African culture, or dislike seeing empowered women characters. Was it my favorite in the MCU? No. Are there people who give it 10 stars just because of the all black cast? Maybe. But 1 Star? Please. That's just Alt-Right spamming. It's a good contribution to the overarching MCU storyline. Worth watching.\n8\nTheFirstExecutioner (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53742734/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_uname)\nLong Live the King (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/reviews/?featured=rw4067615&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_hd)\nBlack Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.\nPros:\nCoogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.\nAs expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther.\nCons:\nThe pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better.\nOverall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain.\nBlack Panther gets an A.\nRemembering Chadwick Boseman: 1976–2020\nRemembering Chadwick Boseman: 1976–2020\nWe celebrate the life and legacy of actor Chadwick Boseman, best known for\nBlack Panther (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/?ref_=tt_eds_center-3_lk)\n,\n42 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453562/?ref_=tt_eds_center-3_lk)\n, and\nMarshall (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5301662/?ref_=tt_eds_center-3_lk)\n.\nWatch the video (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls025720609/videoplayer/vi1615773209/?ref_=tt_c_vd_cut_chadwick_cta)\n1:08 (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls025720609/videoplayer/vi1615773209/?ref_=tt_vd_cut_chadwick_i)\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n7.5\nDoctor Strange (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n7.9\nThor: Ragnarok (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478970/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n7.2\nAnt-Man (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478970/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9114286/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n6.6\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9114286/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_4)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_5)\n7.8\nCaptain America: Civil War (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_5)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_6)\n7.7\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_6)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_7)\n7.3\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_7)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_8)\n7.4\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_8)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6320628/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_9)\n7.4\nSpider-Man: Far from Home (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6320628/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_9)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3896198/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_10)\n7.6\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3896198/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_10)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_11)\n8.0\nThe Avengers (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_11)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5095030/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_12)\n7.0\nAnt-Man and the Wasp (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5095030/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_12)\nStoryline (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/#storyline)\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt1825683/storyline&ref_=tt_stry)\nDid you know\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt1825683/fun-facts&tt_dyk)\nTrivia (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/trivia/?ref_=tt_dyk_trv)\nDuring an interview with Michel Martin on the radio program \"All Things Considered,\"\nDanai Gurira (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1775091/?ref_=dyk_trv)\n(Okoye) said that the language spoken by Wakandans is a real language, Xhosa, a South African language characterized by clicks and glottal stops: \"It's the same language that is native to\nNelson Mandela (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541691/?ref_=dyk_trv)\n.

'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is lauded for Tom Holland's engaging portrayal of Peter Parker, Michael Keaton's Vulture, and its blend of humor and drama. The film's unique approach to Spider-Man's story, focusing on high school life, is appreciated. However, criticisms include reliance on the MCU framework, inconsistent abilities, and less impactful humor and action. Pacing, product placement, and female character handling also draw complaints.\nAI-generated from the text of user reviews\nComedic brilliance\nAction sequences\nAdaptation\nAuthentic emotion\nCharacter development\nChemistry\nGenerational appeal\nTechnical elements\nFeatured reviews\n7\ncarlahenriquesc-51974 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur128826900/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_uname)\nNot bad but not great (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/reviews/?featured=rw6536798&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_hd)\nIf you are a true fan of spider-man, this movie isn't for you but if you can keep an open mind you might actually enjoy it.\nIt's predictable, like most super heroes movies, it's not a great movie but it's a good one!\nEven though Tom Holland performs a teenager that talks to much I kind of enjoy his performance.\nI would say it's a movie to watch when you want something light with a little bit of action.\n8\nNoah-Pfister (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur56169658/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_uname)\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/reviews/?featured=rw3749351&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_hd)\nFINALLY!!!! This is the version of Spider-Man that I've been waiting YEARS for. Tom Holland nails both Peter Parker, and Spider-Man so perfectly, giving each of them a distinct personality. Robert Downey Jr. is used sparingly and never intrudes on Spider- Man's movie and even feels like a father figure at some points. Michael Keaton KILLS as the Vulture and gives Marvel one of its greatest villains to date. Everyone else gives there A-game in Marvel's top 5 best movies to date. Yes, there are some jokes that don't land and yes, this does feel like a John Hughes movie with Spider-Man perfectly stuffed in rather than a super-hero movie, but writing is perfect, the story is AMAZING (wink, wink), and overall, it's a well directed, well made movie. Everyone involved should be proud of themselves. So in all, watch it, then watch it again. SIDE NOTE/SPOILER: STAY TIL THE END OF THE CREDITS IF YOU WANT MARVEL TO GIVE YOU THE FINGER. WORTH IT.\n5\nanto_capone (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2344867/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_uname)\nSuperhero Movie Fatigue (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/reviews/?featured=rw3816879&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_hd)\nPlease take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.\nI'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.\nThe main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.\nIt just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.\nThese superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.\nI still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.\nThanks for reading!\n10\nbrandonius-23056 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur91528096/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_uname)\nAmazing (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/reviews/?featured=rw4508536&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_hd)\nTom Holland really captures the heart of the character. Well paced. Michael Keaton is the 3rd best villain in the MCU behind Thanos and Loki. Great. Best Spiderman movie\n9\ndavisfreak (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81498458/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_uname)\nThe Most Accurate Spidey Yet! (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/reviews/?featured=rw3836022&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_hd)\nI can see how Sam Raimi fans found this movie to be awful. Personally, I'm a Raimi fan myself, but did found his Spiderman movies to be weak (specially Spiderman 3, sheesh). So this movie has nothing to compare itself with his work.\nNow, if you're a die-hard Spiderman fan, you'll love this adaptation, which covers the true, honest, whimsical and kinda naive nature of Peter Parker.\nPhotography was excellent and the musical score brings the whole city and characters to life. Keaton's work in particular was a bit underwhelming for me, but that's not his fault... it's the screenplay, which to be honest felt a bit forced and not up to standards for an MCU movie.\nNevertheless, it's a great stand-alone flick you should definitely watch. You'll have a great time, and also enjoy how Marvel wishes to develop young Parker's character from here on out.\nWhich Actors Almost Played Spider-Man?\nWhich Actors Almost Played Spider-Man?\nSpider-Man has been one of the biggest superhero franchises to hit the big screen in the past two decades.

It was well directed, written and acted, and I was very excited for the next Captain America movie. And this movie most definietly delivered in quality. Is it as good as its predecessor? No, definietly not. There are a few flaws, which I'll talk about later. With that being said, this movie gets 4 things right for every one thing it does wrong. The plot is engaging and for the most part easy to follow and the pacing is solid. The characters all feel very 3-dimentional and fleshed out, and none of them feel different from what we already know. The movie's biggest strength is the interactions between the characters, and the different arguments presented by both sides. I love that despite obviously wanting us to side with Cap's team, the movie doesn't really make one side the \"correct\" one. Both sides present reasonable and logical arguments, and there is no right answer to what the Avengers should do. The new characters such as Black Panther and Spiderman are both very interesting and compelling, and both feel like a natural inclusion to the character list. All this is of course helped by some excellent performances as usual. The direction and cinematography are also both really good, and the action scenes are almost just as good as in Winter Soldier, even though some feel a little meaningless. And, while it might not be a big deal, MAN was it good to see a truly great antagonist in Zemo. He's well written and very well played by Daniel Brühl, and he challenges the ideological perspectives of our hero in a way no other villain in the MCU has done before. With that being said, his plan is somewhat ridiculous, and felt a little too complicated. The movie also feels a little dumb sometimes. It feels like Cap and Stark could've solved the issue much sooner had they just communicated better. Those are my main complaints, and while there are a few other things I could nitpick, nothing really ruins the film by any means. It's a more mature take on the Marvel formula, and while it's the best movie in the franchise, it's still more than good enough for me to recommend it.\n9\nandreascaloni (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129540860/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_2_uname)\nGRIPPING, BOLD AND SMART (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/reviews/?featured=rw6788960&ref_=tt_ururv_c_2_hd)\nCaptain America Civil War is a gripping, bold, smart and awesome superhero movie. It boasts of a talented cast, a great direction and awesome action sequences. Matching spectacular and epic moments with the smarts of a great, grown up thriller, Captain America Civil War is a fun, epic and emotional ride that you won't miss.\nRating: 8,8.\n8\nsnoozejonc (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120966602/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_3_uname)\nHuge amount of spectacle & character moments (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/reviews/?featured=rw7158618&ref_=tt_ururv_c_3_hd)\nWhen an incident involving Wanda Maximoff causes a deadly explosion in Lagos, the UN want to regulate the use of the Avengers.\n'Captain America Civil War' is an enjoyable but slightly overlong MCU movie that has some fantastic spectacle and strong character moments.\nThe plot has an excellent premise with a plausible world reaction to the exploits of a group of people with superpowers and a good villain. Where it slightly falters as a stand-alone movie is the introduction of several new characters that somewhat bogs down the proceedings, but for the wider franchise narrative (and expansion) it is necessary. Several characters have emotional arcs to go through in this story and there is only so much time to do it all.\nAll that being said it has some of the best moments of the franchise, particularly during the scenes of internal conflict amongst the central characters. Iron Man, Black Panther, Captain America and the Winter Soldier are involved in some very compelling scenes, as are Wanda and Vision.\nSome of the visuals are incredibly well done. The early Lagos action scenes hit like a sledgehammer and you can almost feel the impact of what is being shown. The airport showdown is excessive but so much fun you can imagine the writers planning a fanboy's ultimate fantasy. The final confrontation is well made from a spectacle and character perspective.\nThe first time I saw it was my first sight of the digital effect that makes actors appear younger. This is a very impressive use of CGI that feels like real movie magic.\nAll performances are strong especially Robert Downey Jr and Daniel Bruhl.\nIt's a 7.5/10 for me but I round upwards.\n8\nlnvicta (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30151001/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_4_uname)\nThe Winter Soldier has competition. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/reviews/?featured=rw3470041&ref_=tt_ururv_c_4_hd)\nThe Winter Soldier has competition for being the best Marvel movie. There's no other way to say it: Civil War is phenomenal. Marvel continues the trend of upping the stakes by pinning our favorite heroes against each other: Captain America and Iron Man. There are a lot of other characters, so much so that it feels more like an Avengers movie than a solo movie, but the story is told in such a way that the spotlight is always on Cap and Bucky.\nCivil War is tonally different from Winter Soldier in that it's more bombastic in its storytelling. Again, there are a lot of Avengers in the movie (more than the freaking Avengers movie). While Winter Soldier was a relatively grounded, dark political thriller, Civil War is a louder, more colorful take on the political theme, and a much more personal one as well. This time it's a matter of morals and ethics, and it's amazing how the movie pulls off giving each side of the argument weight and credibility so you could argue about who's right and who's wrong all day.\nSteve wants to protect his best friend Bucky who was brainwashed by Hydra and is now a fugitive from the law. He doesn't trust any form of government faction. He saw how far up corruption goes and he's not willing to lose jurisdiction of the Avengers to yet another corrupt governmental body. Tony wants everyone to sign an agreement for the UN so they won't be seen as a threat by the world governments due to their track record of leaving behind messes and casualties. It's a terrific plot, very thrilling and character driven. At its core it's a very personal story between Steve and Tony. The other characters are written as complimentary pieces to one puzzle. It's not gratuitous at all. You understand everyone's ideologies - why they disagree with each other, why they're on the sides that they're on, why they're fighting for what they're fighting for - and they're each given enough screen time for us to care. And the action scenes are TWS level. Nothing quite beats the first confrontation between CA and WS, but the end of the second act of this movie has an action sequence that is absolutely mesmerizing. It's the civil war. Seeing all of these superheros go against each other is exhilarating, and their interactions are hysterical, especially since a lot of them are meeting each other for the first time.\nThe new characters are excellent - Black Panther makes a hell of an impression as a sophisticated Wakandan diplomat, and Spider-Man is easily the best live action interpretation of the character; major props to Tom Holland for sounding exactly how you'd expect Spider-Man to sound like. It's an absolute joy to watch. One aspect of Civil War I find especially fascinating is the use of its villain, Zemo. You have no idea what he's plotting for a good chunk of the movie. He shows up intermittently as the first couple of acts are playing out doing cryptic stuff vaguely involving Hydra, and finally the third act converges on Zemo and why he's doing what he's doing, and it's about the simplest thing: vengeance. It's incredible to watch this ordinary man - no powers or abilities - just a smart, patient man, have a conceivable shot at destroying the Avengers. And the actor is excellent too. It's a nice change of pace from the invincible demigods and dull dark elves we've been getting in previous installments.\nCivil War is an expertly made film all around. The acting is top notch as always, the directing and the writing are masterful, I can go on and on. It's a political, personal, and powerfully conveyed story with tons of popcorn blockbuster appeal, rivaled only by The Winter Soldier in the MCU. Highly recommended.\nAfterBuzz (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4572124/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_5_uname)\na wonderful character study to go along with the BEST action I've ever seen! (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/reviews/?featured=rw3451619&ref_=tt_ururv_c_5_hd)\nAt the start, the film finds Captain America yet again adjusting to working under the increasingly morally ambiguous ways of the new Avengers structure. The set up is masterfully done. This is the fifth time we've seen the character and it's remarkable how complex and how much depth has been layered on to developing this icon. The Avengers film touched a bit with his feelings of what it was like to be in the modern era, and Winter Soldier drove the point home. Following that classic sequel, Civil War is a wonderful character study to go along with a purely thrilling plot. This was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver a film to advance the character of Captain America but also give Tony Stark a perfect finishing arc and more development himself. What makes BOTH Steve and Tony interesting aren't their abilities or weapons but the men themselves. Steve's moral code and \"man out of time\" elements are tested in this film but not in a way anyone saw coming. The viewer that normally would trust that Cap is doing what's right can look at his actions in a different light. He is still coming to terms with a past that is long gone and he is still longing for a better more decent era. Putting Bucky back in the mix clouds his judgment. Dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of any controlling organization after the events of the Winter Soldier movie has changed him. It's exactly like all the epic events and decisions Tony Stark has made over five films has changed the character of Iron Man. The resulting conflict between the two is as epic as can be.\nLike in Steve's last solo movie, his past comes back and explodes all throughout his new life. Tracking down his old pal Bucky, who was once an amoral assassin and a mind controlled Russian thug, proves to be a catalyst to everything that happens. Everything happens and unfolds in a believable and an intelligent manner. Every single ultimately cool character gets a chance to shine including Bucky but also incredible new characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man. Each one is fleshed out wonderfully for their supporting roles. Again, beyond cool.\nI really enjoyed both previous Captain America films but this movie is as dark and exciting as Winter Solder but also adds a degree of depth. This movie has a whole new flavor and that's exactly what was needed and what Marvel does so well. The 1940's romance and even the \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" tone fit the first film quite nicely. The conspiracy thriller vibe of the second film was refreshing and so well done. Here, just like the Cap character, adaptation is a key. What they deliver with this Civil War feels fresh and is certainly amazing. Steve is still a patriot but he's continuing to question authority. His old-fashioned values pay off in many cases but here, are they leading him astray? Questioning what is wrong and questioning what is morally cloudy is a test of true character. Yet, being old school stubborn can result in missing key points and can result in bad consequences. That is exactly why the character of Steve Rogers is so interesting. He's so much more than a super soldier boy scout. There's depth, angst and pathos and we all can relate to him. He is out-of-place and he is old-fashioned but proud of that in a way. In a movie like this, pride comes before the fall. Tony Stark is ahead of him on that curve. Tony knows the price of arrogance and even the price of acting unilaterally with the best of intentions. He knows the road to hell is paved with those best of intentions. When these two philosophies and life lessons collide, that's as cool as the superhero brawl that accompanies it.\nThe story itself is an amazing action thriller with a ton of intrigue and psychological issues. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this clever and this deep. I did expect it to be exciting and it certainly delivers on that. Each new character and each hold over Avenger character works in to the story perfectly. Everything about this movie is a joy to watch. The cast is perfect and everyone is used exceptionally well. This IS the best sequel the genre has ever seen and I know tat's saying a lot.

'Avengers: Infinity War' is acclaimed for its grand scale, exhilarating action, and Josh Brolin's standout performance as Thanos. The film is celebrated for cohesively blending numerous Marvel characters, offering significant moments for each. Yet, it faces criticism for pacing, inconsistent character strengths, and over-reliance on shock value. Humor and storytelling effectiveness receive mixed feedback, with some viewers finding them engaging, while others feel they undermine the narrative.\nAI-generated from the text of user reviews\nAction sequences\nCharacter development\nComedic brilliance\nEmotional stakes\nEpic\nGreat ensemble\nThrilling\nUnpredictable\nFeatured reviews\n9\nandreascaloni (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129540860/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_uname)\nEMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews/?featured=rw6604563&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_hd)\nAvengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.\nRating: 9.6.\n8\nAbdulxoxo (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur106279729/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_uname)\nA superior avengers sequel (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews/?featured=rw6564964&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_hd)\nAlthough this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.\nOverall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.\n10\ncartermain (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur89226807/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_uname)\nA film that pulled off the impossible. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews/?featured=rw6506593&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_hd)\nAvengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a proper and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.\nBut it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was great. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.\n8\nFilmdokter (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur38220046/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_uname)\nIt all led to this: superhero film at its best (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews/?featured=rw7479722&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_hd)\n#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.\n10\ngrztxks (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur128816687/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_uname)\nBetter than Endgame (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews/?featured=rw6692429&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_hd)\nInfinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie.\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n8.4\nAvengers: Endgame (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n8.0\nThe Avengers (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n7.3\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10872600/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n8.2\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10872600/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_4)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_5)\n7.8\nCaptain America: Civil War (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_5)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_6)\n7.9\nThor: Ragnarok (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_6)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_7)\n7.5\nDoctor Strange (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_7)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6320628/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_8)\n7.4\nSpider-Man: Far from Home (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6320628/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_8)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_9)\n7.4\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_9)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015381/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_10)\n8.0\nGuardians of the Galaxy (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015381/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_10)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_11)\n7.7\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_11)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_12)\n7.9\nIron Man (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_12)\nStoryline (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/#storyline)\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt4154756/storyline&ref_=tt_stry)\nDid you know\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt4154756/fun-facts&tt_dyk)\nTrivia (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/trivia/?ref_=tt_dyk_trv)\nTom Holland (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4043618/?ref_=dyk_trv)\nwas not allowed to read the script for this movie, since he revealed too many secrets for\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/?ref_=dyk_trv)\n.
