Many of the NGOs represented at the protests came with credentials to participate in the official meetings, while also planning various educational and press events. The AFL–CIO, with cooperation from its member unions, organized a large permitted rally and march from\nSeattle Center (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Center)\nto\ndowntown (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown,_Seattle,_Washington)\n.\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WTO_protestors,_1999_(20680767813).jpg)\nThe \"turtles\": protestors in sea turtle costumes\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WTO_protest_sign_(14988892087).jpg)\nWTO protest sign depicting the organization trampling on three environmental laws.\nHowever, others were more interested in taking\ndirect action (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action)\n, including both\ncivil disobedience (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience)\nand acts of vandalism and property destruction to disrupt the meeting. Several groups were loosely organized together under the\nDirect Action Network (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Action_Network)\n(DAN), with a plan to disrupt the meetings by blocking streets and intersections downtown to prevent delegates from reaching the convention center, where the meeting was to be held.

On the same day, the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development reported:\ndeveloping countries have remained steadfast in their demand that developed countries honour Uruguay Round commitments before moving forward full force with new trade negotiations.

Several hundred activists arrived in the deserted streets near the convention center and began to take control of key intersections. Over the next few hours, a number of marchers began to converge on the area from different directions. These included a student march from the north, a march of citizens of the developing world who marched in from the south and, beginning around 09:00, militant anarchists (in a formation known as a\nblack bloc (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc)\n) marching down Pike Street from 6th Avenue, blockading the streets with newspaper boxes and smashing windows.\n[17] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-depts.washington.edu-17)\nSome demonstrators held rallies, others held teach-ins and at least one group staged an early-morning street party.

This seems to have set off a chain reaction of sorts, with previously nonviolent protesters throwing bottles at police and joining in the vandalism shortly before noon.\n[17] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-depts.washington.edu-17)\nThe police were eventually overwhelmed by the mass of protesters downtown, including many who had chained themselves together and were blocking intersections. Meanwhile, the late-morning labor-organized rally and march drew tens of thousands; though the intended march route had them turning back before they reached the convention center, some ignored the marshals and joined what had become a chaotic scene downtown.\nAt noon, the opening ceremony at the convention center was officially canceled.\n[17] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-depts.washington.edu-17)\nIt took police much of the afternoon and evening to clear the streets.

Police surrounded and arrested several groups of would-be protesters (and more than one bystander).  Beginning at 21:00, a major clash took place on Broadway in the vicinity of Denny Way, involving rocks, bottles, and police concussion grenades.  It did not involve a black bloc, but appears to have included local residents, although it is known that many local residents were treated as protesters, even being teargassed, despite having no part in the protests. Police called in from other cities mistook the typically crowded streets of Capitol Hill as groups of protesters.\n[21] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-21)\n[22] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-22)\nMore than 500 people were jailed on Wednesday. Throughout the day, police used tear gas to disperse crowds downtown, although a permitted demonstration organized by the Steelworkers Union was held along the waterfront.\n[23] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-23)\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:National_Guard,_Downtown_Seattle,_WTO_1999.jpg)\nArmy National Guardsmen marching to their next assignment\nDecember 2–3\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1999_Seattle_WTO_protests&action=edit&section=6)\n]\nProtests continued the following days.

On December 3 the conference ended as delegations were unable to reach agreements, partly in response to the protests.\n[24] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-24)\n[25] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-25)\nConfrontations with the police continued, albeit at a lower intensity. The primary goal of disrupting the trade talks achieved, some sought the horizons of possibility; it was determined quickly that the necessary ambition to achieve the broader goals of various anarchist factions was not sufficient.\n[26] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-26)\nMedia response\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1999_Seattle_WTO_protests&action=edit&section=7)\n]\nThe New York Times (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)\npublished false reports that protesters threw\nMolotov cocktails (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail)\nat police.\n[27] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-27)\nTwo days later, the\nTimes\nprinted a correction saying that the protest was mostly peaceful and no protesters were accused of throwing objects at delegates or the police, but the original error persisted in later accounts in the mainstream media.\n[28] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-28)\nThe\nSeattle City Council (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_City_Council)\ndispelled the reports with its own investigation findings:\nThe level of panic among police is evident from radio communication and from their inflated crowd estimates, which exceed the numbers shown on news videotapes. ARC investigators found the rumors of \"Molotov cocktails\" and sale of flammables from a supermarket had no basis in fact. But, rumors were important in contributing to the police sense of being besieged and in considerable danger.\n[29] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-29)\nAn article in the magazine\nThe Nation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nation)\ndisputed that Molotov cocktails have ever been thrown at an antiglobalization protest within the United States.\n[30] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-30)\nThough media coverage of the protests condemned the violence of some of the protesters, the nature of this violence has been justified by some people. Specifically, the violence employed was not person-to-person violence, but \"acts directed toward property, not people\".\n[31] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDeLucaPeeples2002-31)\nThough many still denounced the violent tactics used by protesters, this violence clearly resulted in increased media coverage of the event. The WTO meeting had an increase in evening news airtime from 10 minutes and 40 seconds on the first day of the meeting to 17 minutes on the first day of violence. In addition, WTO coverage was the lead or second story on\nCNN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN)\n,\nABC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News_(United_States))\n,\nCBS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News)\n, and\nNBC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News)\nafter violence was reported. Two days after the start of violence, the meeting remained the top story on three of the four networks.\nThough these numbers alone are telling, the media coverage of subsequent demonstrations that did not include violence by protesters shows even more the effect of violence on coverage. For example, the World Bank/International Monetary Fund (WB/\nIMF (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF)\n) meetings in the spring showed a \"coverage pattern that was almost the reverse of that in Seattle\" and that \"suggests the crucial role of violence in garnering time on the public screen.\" In an even more striking example of the effects of violence on media coverage, the 2001 WTO meeting in Doha, Qatar, included no reports of violence. As a result, \"there was absolutely no TV evening news coverage by the four major networks.\"\n[31] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDeLucaPeeples2002-31)\nThis coverage did not center exclusively on the violence. Instead, details of the protesters' message and antiglobalization campaign were included along with the discussions of symbolic violence taking place. It is said that the violence served as a dense surface that opened viewers' and readers' minds to a whole new way of thinking about globalization and corporations' operations. That is, not only was this violence contained within the familiar setting of television, and not only did it meet the criteria of being dramatic and emotional enough to warrant air time, but it also shattered preconceived notions of globalization and the practices of corporations that drive so much of America's economy.\n[31] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDeLucaPeeples2002-31)\nAftermath\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1999_Seattle_WTO_protests&action=edit&section=8)\n]\nTo many in North American anarchist and radical circles, the Seattle WTO riots, protests, and demonstrations were viewed as a success.\n[32] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-32)\nPrior to the \"Battle of Seattle\", almost no mention was made of \"antiglobalization\" in the US media, while the protests were seen as having forced the media to report on 'why' anybody would oppose the WTO.\n[33] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-33)\nPrevious mass demonstrations had taken place in Australia in December 1997, in which newly formed grass-roots organizations blockaded Melbourne,\nPerth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth)\n, Sydney, and\nDarwin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory)\ncity centers.\n[34] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-34)\nControversy over the city's response to the protests resulted in the resignation of the police chief of Seattle,\nNorm Stamper (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Stamper)\n,\n[35] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-35)\nand arguably played a role in Schell's loss to\nGreg Nickels (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Nickels)\nin the 2001 mayoral primary election.\n[36] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-36)\n[37] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-37)\nThe massive size of the protest added $3 million to the city's estimated meeting budget of $6 million, partly due to city cleanup and police overtime bills. In addition, the damage to commercial businesses from\nvandalism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism)\nand lost sales has been estimated at $20 million.\n[38] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-38)\nOn January 16, 2004, the city of Seattle settled with 157 individuals arrested outside of the no-protest zone during the WTO events, agreeing to pay them a total of $250,000.\n[39] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-39)\nOn January 30, 2007, a federal jury found that the city had violated protesters'\nFourth Amendment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\nconstitutional rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_rights)\nby arresting them without\nprobable cause (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause)\nor evidence.\n[40] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-40)\n[41] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-41)\nInspired by these protests, a similar one occurred in\nPrague (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-globalization_protests_in_Prague)\nin September 2000.\n[42] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-42)\nAround 12,000 activists gathered to protest during the\nInternational Monetary Fund (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund)\nand\nWorld Bank (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank)\nsummit on September 27, 2000.\n[43] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_note-43)\nSee also\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1999_Seattle_WTO_protests&action=edit&section=9)\n]\n1988 IMF/World Bank protests (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_IMF/World_Bank_protests)\n, anti-globalization precursor protest a decade earlier in West Berlin\n27th G8 summit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27th_G8_summit)\n, a 2001 summit that resulted in anti-globalization protests and similar controversies about police and government response\nBattle in Seattle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_in_Seattle)\n, a 2007 film loosely based on the protests.\nElectrohippies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrohippies)\n, an international group of internet activists involved in action against the WTO\nList of incidents of civil unrest in the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incidents_of_civil_unrest_in_the_United_States)\nMultilateral Agreement on Investment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateral_Agreement_on_Investment)\n, a draft agreement that failed in 1998\nShowdown in Seattle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showdown_in_Seattle)\n, a 1999 documentary film about the protests\n30 Frames a Second: The WTO in Seattle 2000 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Frames_a_Second:_The_WTO_in_Seattle_2000)\n, a 2000 documentary shot during the protests\nVia Campesina (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Campesina)\n, an international movement of peasants' organizations\nAnti-globalization protests in Prague (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-globalization_protests_in_Prague)\n, anti-capitalist protest in Prague (2000)\nReferences\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1999_Seattle_WTO_protests&action=edit&section=10)\n]\nFootnotes\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1999_Seattle_WTO_protests&action=edit&section=11)\n]\n^ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests#cite_ref-1)\n\"WTO riots in Seattle: 15 years ago\" (http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/WTO-riots-in-Seattle-15-years-ago-5915088.php)\n.

Shortly before doing so, he and Conrad Westervelt created the\n\"B&W\" seaplane (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Model_1)\n.\n[13] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-14)\nIn 1917, the organization was renamed Boeing Airplane Company, with William Boeing forming Boeing Airplane & Transport Corporation in 1928.\n[14] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-15)\nIn 1929, the company was renamed\nUnited Aircraft and Transport Corporation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Aircraft_and_Transport_Corporation)\n, followed by the acquisition of several aircraft makers such as Avion, Chance\nVought (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought)\n,\nSikorsky Aviation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_Aircraft)\n,\nStearman Aircraft (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stearman_Aircraft)\n,\nPratt & Whitney (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney)\n, and Hamilton Metalplane.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-Britannica_Boe-3)\nIn 1931, the group merged its four smaller airlines into\nUnited Airlines (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines)\n. In 1934, aircraft manufacturing was required to be separate from air transportation.\n[15] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-Encyclopedia_Britannica-16)\nTherefore, Boeing Airplane Company became one of three major groups to arise from the dissolution of United Aircraft and Transport; the other two entities were\nUnited Aircraft (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Aircraft)\n(later\nUnited Technologies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Technologies)\n) and United Airlines.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-Britannica_Boe-3)\n[15] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-Encyclopedia_Britannica-16)\nIn 1960, the company bought\nVertol Aircraft Corporation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piasecki_Helicopter)\n, which at the time, was the biggest independent manufacturer of\nhelicopters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter)\n.\n[16] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-17)\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the company diversified into industries such as outer space travel, marine craft, agriculture, energy production and transit systems.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-Britannica_Boe-3)\nSea Launch\nIn 1995, Boeing partnered with Russian, Ukrainian, and Anglo-Norwegian organizations to create\nSea Launch (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Launch)\n, a company providing commercial launch services sending satellites to geostationary orbit from floating platforms.\n[17] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-18)\nIn 2000, Boeing acquired the satellite segment of\nHughes Electronics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_Electronics)\n.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-Britannica_Boe-3)\n[18] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-19)\nMerger with McDonnell Douglas\nIn December 1996, Boeing announced its intention to merge with\nMcDonnell Douglas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas)\n, which, following regulatory approval, was completed on August 4, 1997.\n[19] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-20)\nThe delay was caused by objections from the\nEuropean Commission (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission)\n, which ultimately placed three conditions on the merger: exclusivity agreements with three US airlines would be terminated, separate accounts would be maintained for the McDonnell-Douglas civil aircraft business, and some defense patents were to be made available to competitors.\n[20] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-21)\nIn 2020,\nQuartz (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_(publication))\nreported that after the merger there was a \"clash of corporate cultures, where Boeing's engineers and McDonnell Douglas's bean-counters went head-to-head\", which the latter won, and that this may have contributed to the events leading up to the 737 MAX crash crisis.\n[21] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-frost-22)\nCorporate headquarters moves\nBoeing's corporate headquarters moved from Seattle to Chicago in 2001.\n[22] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-23)\nIn 2018, the company opened its first factory in Europe at\nSheffield (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield)\n, UK, reinforced by a research partnership with the\nUniversity of Sheffield (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sheffield)\n.\n[23] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-24)\nIn May 2020, the company cut over 12,000 jobs due to the drop in air travel during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)\nwith plans for a total 10% cut of its workforce or approximately 16,000 positions.\n[24] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-25)\nIn July 2020, Boeing reported a loss of $2.4 billion as a result of the pandemic and the\nBoeing 737 MAX groundings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings)\n, and that it was in response planning to make more job and production cuts.\n[25] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-26)\nOn August 18, 2020, CEO Dave Calhoun announced further job cuts;\n[26] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-27)\non October 28, 2020, nearly 30,000 employees were laid off, as the airplane manufacturer was increasingly losing money due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n[27] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-28)\nIn May 2022, Boeing announced plans to transfer its global headquarters from Chicago to\nArlington, Virginia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Virginia)\n, a suburb of Washington, D.C. The company said that this decision was made in part to concentrate on its defense work with \"proximity to our customers and stakeholders\".\n[28] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-Boe_HQ_move-29)\n[29] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#cite_note-Wash_Post_HQ_move-30)\nAfter the January 2024\nAlaska Airlines Flight 1282 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines_Flight_1282)\nand other incidents, one shareholder proposed relocating the corporate headquarters back to the Seattle area in hopes of getting engineering and quality control teams on-site access to key decision-makers.

The conflagration lasted for less than a day, burning through the afternoon and into the night, during the same summer as the\nGreat Spokane Fire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Spokane_Fire)\nand the\nGreat Ellensburg Fire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ellensburg_Fire)\n. Seattle quickly rebuilt using brick buildings that sat 20 feet (6.1 m) above the original street level. Its population swelled during reconstruction, becoming the largest city in the newly admitted state of Washington.\nEarly Seattle\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Seattle_Fire&action=edit&section=1)\n]\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yesler_Way_looking_west_from_1st_Ave,_June_5,_1889_(CURTIS_2034).jpeg)\nLooking west on Mill Street (today's Yesler Way) across Front Street (today's First Avenue) June 5, 1889, one day before this district burned. Korn block on left; Yesler-Leary Building, center; Occidental Hotel, right.\nIn the fall of 1851, the\nDenny Party (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Party)\narrived at\nAlki Point (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alki_Point,_Seattle)\nin what is now the state of\nWashington (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state))\n. After spending a miserable winter on the western shores of\nElliott Bay (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Bay)\n, the party relocated to the eastern shores and established the settlement that eventually became Seattle.\n[1] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-1)\nEarly Seattle was dominated by the logging industry. The combination of a safe\nbay (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay)\nand an abundance of\nconiferous (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniferous)\ntrees made Seattle the perfect location for shipping lumber to California. In 1852,\nHenry Yesler (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Yesler)\nbegan construction of the first steam-powered mill in the Pacific Northwest.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-2)\nBecause of the easy access to lumber, nearly every building was constructed of the affordable but combustible timber. Additionally, because the area was at or below sea level, the fledgling town was a frequent victim of massive floods, requiring buildings to be built on wooden stilts. The town also used hollowed out scrap logs propped up on wooden braces as sewer and water pipes, increasing the combustible loading.\nEvents of the fire\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Seattle_Fire&action=edit&section=2)\n]\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Southwest_corner_of_First_Avenue_and_Madison,_Great_Seattle_Fire,_June_6,_1889.jpg)\nLooking south on Front St. from Spring St. about one-half hour after the fire started\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aftermath_of_Seattle_fire_of_June_6,_1889_(CURTIS_448).jpeg)\nAftermath of Seattle fire of June 6, 1889, looking east at the ruins of the Occidental Hotel at corner of James St. and Yesler Way\nAt approximately 2:20 p.m. on June 6, 1889, an accidentally overheated glue pot in a carpentry shop started the most destructive fire in the history of Seattle.\n[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-:0-3)\n[4] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-Austin-4)\nThe next day, the\nSeattle Post-Intelligencer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Post-Intelligencer)\n, operating out of temporary facilities in the wake of the fire, reported incorrectly that the incident began in \"Jim McGough's paint shop, under Smith's boot and shoe store, at the corner of Front and Madison streets, in what was known as the Denny block\";\n[5] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-P-I_error-5)\na correction two weeks later said that it \"actually started in the Clairmont and Company cabinet shop, below McGough's shop in the basement of the Pontius building\", but the original error was often repeated, including in\nMurray Morgan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Morgan)\n's bestselling Seattle history book\nSkid Road\n(1951).\n[5] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-P-I_error-5)\nJohn Back, a 24-year-old Swede,\n[4] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-Austin-4)\nwas heating glue over a gasoline fire when it boiled over, igniting the wood chips and turpentine covering the floor.\n[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-:0-3)\nBack attempted to douse the fire with water which spread the fire further.\n[6] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-6)\nThe fire department arrived by 2:45, but by that time the area was so smokey that the source of the fire could not be determined.\n[7] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-7)\nSpread of fire\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Seattle_Fire&action=edit&section=3)\n]\nFed by the shop's timber and an unusually dry summer, the blaze erupted and shortly devoured the entire block. A nearby liquor store exploded, and the alcohol fueled the flames. The fire quickly spread north to the Kenyon block and the nearby Madison and Griffith blocks. Wooden boardwalks carried the flames across streets to ignite other blocks.\n[8] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-mcnair-8)\nA combination of ill-preparedness and unfortunate circumstances contributed to the great fire. Seattle's water supply was insufficient in fighting the giant inferno.\nFire hydrants (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_hydrant)\nwere sparsely located on every other street, usually connected to small pipes.\n[9] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-UWLib-9)\nThere were so many hydrants in use during the fire that the water pressure became too weak to combat such a massive blaze. Seattle was also operated by a\nvolunteer fire department (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_fire_department)\n, which was competent but inadequate in extinguishing the fire.\nMagnitude of destruction\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Seattle_Fire&action=edit&section=4)\n]\nBy the morning of June 7, the fire had burned 25 city blocks, including the business district, four of the city's\nwharves (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharf)\n, and its railroad terminals.\n[10] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-10)\nThe fire would be called the most destructive fire in the history of Seattle.\n[4] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-Austin-4)\nDespite the massive destruction of property, few to no deaths occurred. Some claim a young boy named James Goin was killed in the blaze although no reliable records have been found from that time.\n[11] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-11)\nHowever, there were fatalities during the cleanup process. Over 1 million rodents were killed.\n[8] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-mcnair-8)\nTotal losses were estimated at nearly $20 million ($700 million in 2024 dollars).\n[12] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-12)\nAmong the businesses affected were:\n[13] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-13)\nCompany\nDamage\nInsurance\nWashington Iron Works (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Iron_Works)\n$40,000\n$20,000\nMoran Brothers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran_Brothers)\n$45,000\n$1,000\nJohn Leck, iron works\n$12,000\n$1,000\nFront Street Cable\n$15,000\nGordon Hardware Co.\n$120,000\n$30,000\nSeattle Hardware Co.\n$40,000\n$30,000\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aftermath_of_the_Seattle_fire_of_June_6_(SEATTLE_2974_merged_with_SEATTLE_2976).jpg)\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aftermath_of_the_Seattle_fire_of_June_6_(SEATTLE_2974_merged_with_SEATTLE_2976).jpg)\nLooking toward Elliott Bay from the burned-over district\nReconstruction and recovery\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Seattle_Fire&action=edit&section=5)\n]\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MOHAI_-_plates_from_Great_Seattle_Fire.jpg)\nThis stack of dishes fused together by the fire is on display at Seattle's\nMuseum of History and Industry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_History_and_Industry)\nDespite the magnitude of destruction, the rebuilding effort began quickly. Rather than starting over somewhere else, Seattle's citizens chose to rebuild. Seattle rebuilt from the ashes quickly, and the fire killed many rats and other\nvermin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin)\n, thereby eliminating the city's rodent problems.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nA new building ordinance resulted in a downtown of brick and\nstone (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology))\nbuildings, rather than wood.\nIn the year following the fire Seattle's population actually grew by nearly 20,000 to 40,000 inhabitants from the influx of people helping to recreate the city.\n[14] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-14)\nSupplies and funds came from all over the West Coast to support the relief effort. The population increase made Seattle the largest city in Washington, making it a leading contender in becoming the terminus of the\nGreat Northern Railway (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Railway_(U.S.))\n.\n[15] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-15)\nPost-fire reform\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Seattle_Fire&action=edit&section=6)\n]\nSeattle made many improvements in response to the fire. The\nSeattle Fire Department (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Fire_Department)\nwas officially established four months later to replace a volunteer organization with a paid force containing new firehouses and a new chief. The city took control of the water supply, increasing the number of hydrants and adding larger pipes.\n[9] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-UWLib-9)\nThe advent of brick buildings to downtown Seattle was one of the many architectural improvements the city made in the wake of the fire. New city ordinances set standards for the thickness of walls and required \"division walls\" between buildings.\n[16] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_note-16)\nThe changes became principal features of post-fire construction and are still visible in Seattle's\nPioneer Square (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Square,_Seattle,_Washington)\ndistrict today, the present-day location of the fire. At\nPioneer Square (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Square,_Seattle,_Washington)\n, guided tours are also available to paying customers. Also at this location, visitors can tour the\nSeattle Underground (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Underground)\n, where they can visit the original street level (now basement level) of buildings and storefronts that were built after the fire.\nReferences\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Seattle_Fire&action=edit&section=7)\n]\n^ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire#cite_ref-1)\nChris Casey.\n\"Seattle History\" (https://web.archive.org/web/20090331153627/http://www.seattle.com/history/)\n.

1970\nPike Place Market\nis a\npublic market (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplaces#Types)\nin\nSeattle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle)\n, Washington, United States. It opened on August 17, 1907, and is one of the older continuously operated public\nfarmers' markets (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_market)\nin the United States. Overlooking the\nElliott Bay (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Bay)\nwaterfront on\nPuget Sound (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound)\n, it serves as a place of business for many small farmers,\ncraftspeople (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft)\nand\nmerchants (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant)\n. It is named for its central street, Pike Place, which runs northwest from\nPike Street (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Street)\nto Virginia Street on the western edge of\nDowntown Seattle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Seattle)\n. Pike Place Market is Seattle's most popular tourist destination, with more than 20 million annual visitors.\nThe Market is built on the edge of a steep hill and consists of several lower levels located below the main level. Each features a variety of unique\nshops (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retailing#Shops_and_stores)\nsuch as\nantique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiques)\ndealers,\ncomic book (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book)\nand collectible shops, small family-owned\nrestaurants (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant)\n, and one of the oldest\nhead shops (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_shop)\nin Seattle. The upper street level contains\nfishmongers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishmonger)\n, fresh\nproduce (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produce)\nstands and craft stalls operating in the covered\narcades (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_(architecture))\n. Local farmers and craftspeople sell year-round in the arcades from tables they rent from the Market on a daily basis, in accordance with the Market's mission and founding goal: allowing consumers to \"Meet the Producer\".\nPike Place Market is home to nearly 500 residents who live in eight different buildings throughout the Market. Most of these buildings have been low-income housing in the past; however, some of them no longer are, such as the Livingston Baker apartments. The Market is run by the\nquasi-governmental (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_development_authority)\nPike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA).\nLocation and extent\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=1)\n]\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seattle_Pike-Market_map.JPG)\n\"Pike-Market\" neighborhood as represented in the City Clerk's\nSeattle Neighborhood Atlas\n. The heavy line on the map labeled \"\nAlaskan Way Viaduct (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaskan_Way_Viaduct)\n\" was part of\nWashington State Route 99 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Route_99)\n(SR 99) prior to the viaduct's demolition in 2019. The unlabeled street inland from SR 99 as it passes the market is Western Avenue.\nThe Market is located roughly in the northwest corner of Seattle's\ncentral business district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown,_Seattle)\n. To its north is\nBelltown (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belltown,_Seattle)\n. To its southwest are the\ncentral waterfront (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Waterfront,_Seattle)\nand\nElliott Bay (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Bay)\n. Boundaries are diagonal to the compass since the street grid is roughly parallel to the Elliott Bay shoreline.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Seattle_Clerk_Office_Map-2)\n[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-About_Seattle_Clerk_Office_Map-3)\n[4] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-4)\nAs is common with Seattle neighborhoods and districts,\n[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-About_Seattle_Clerk_Office_Map-3)\ndifferent people and organizations draw different boundaries for the market. The City Clerk's Neighborhood Map Atlas gives one of the more expansive definitions, defining a \"Pike-Market\" neighborhood extending from Union Street northwest to Virginia Street and from the waterfront northeast to Second Avenue.\n[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Seattle_Clerk_Office_Map-2)\nDespite coming from the City Clerk's office, this definition has no special official status.\n[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-About_Seattle_Clerk_Office_Map-3)\nThe smaller \"Pike Place Public Market Historic District\" listed on the U.S.\nNational Register of Historic Places (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places)\nis bounded roughly by First Avenue, Virginia Street, Western Avenue, and a building wall about halfway between Union and Pike Streets, running parallel to those streets.\n[5] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-5)\nIn a middle ground between those two definitions, the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods' official 7-acre (28,000 m\n2\n) \"Pike Place Market Historical District\"\n[6] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-hist-dist-6)\nincludes the federally recognized Pike Place Public Market Historic District plus a slightly smaller piece of land between Western Avenue and\nWashington State Route 99 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Route_99)\n, on the side of the market toward Elliott Bay.\n[7] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-7)\nTo some extent, these different definitions of the market district result from struggles between preservationists and developers. For example, the\nNational Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historic_Preservation_Act_of_1966)\ncreated the Washington Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.\nVictor Steinbrueck (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Steinbrueck)\n, at one point in the late 1960s, convinced the Advisory Council to recommend designating 17 acres (69,000 m\n2\n) as a historical district. Pressure by developers and the \"Seattle establishment\" soon got that reduced to a tenth of that area.\n[8] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Crowley-1999-8)\n[9] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-9)\nThe present-day historic district designations lie between these extremes.\nPart of the market sits on what was originally\nmudflats (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflats)\nbelow the bluffs west of Pike Place. In the late 19th century, West Street (now Western Avenue, angling away from Pike Place) was already a through street running more or less parallel to the shore. Railroad Avenue (now Alaskan Way) was built farther out on pilings; it was not filled in until the 1930s. Nearby piers with warehouses for convenient\nstevedoring (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevedore)\nhad already been completed by 1905, two years before the market opened.\n[10] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-10)\n[11] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-11)\nHistory\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=2)\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of Pike Place Market (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Pike_Place_Market)\nThe market was created in 1907 when\nSeattle City Council (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_City_Council)\nmember\nThomas P. Revelle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_P._Revelle)\ntook advantage of an 1896 ordinance that allowed the city to designate tracts of land as public markets\n[12] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-12)\nand designated a portion of the area of Western Avenue above the\nElliott Bay (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Bay)\ntideflats off Pike Street and First Avenue.\n[13] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-13)\nThe market was opened August 17, 1907, by City Council President\nCharles Hiram Burnett (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hiram_Burnett_Sr.)\nJr.\n[14] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-official-web-history-14)\nThe first building at the Market, the Main Arcade, opened November 30, 1907.\n[8] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Crowley-1999-8)\n[15] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-15)\nDemand for stalls grew and by 1911 the number of available stalls had doubled. The west side of the stall lines were soon covered in an overhead canopy and roofing, becoming known as the \"dry row\".\n[16] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-16)\nIn 1916 the market expanded into the\nEconomy Market (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_Market)\n.\n[17] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-17)\nThroughout the early 1920s, the north side of the\nCorner Market (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_Market)\nbecame known as the\nSanitary Market (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_Market)\nand the area developed into a social scene.\n[18] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-:0-18)\nA new ordinance forbidding farmers' stalls to be placed in the street resulted in proposals to move the market, but in 1921 the City Council voted to retain the existing location and work on expanding in place.\n[19] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Shorett_2007_50-19)\n[20] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-20)\n[21] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-21)\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seattle_marketplace.jpg)\nAn assortment of fruits available for sale\nIn 1963, a proposal was floated to demolish Pike Place Market and replace it with\nPike Plaza\n, which met community opposition, including help from\nBetty Bowen (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Bowen)\n,\nVictor Steinbrueck (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Steinbrueck)\n, Ibsen Nelsen, and others from the board of Friends of the Market.\n[22] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-22)\nAn\ninitiative (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_initiative)\nwas passed on November 2, 1971, that created a\nhistoric preservation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation)\nzone and returned the Market to public hands.\nIn the 1980s, a nonprofit group, the Pike Place Market Foundation, was established by the PDA to raise funds and administer the Market's free clinic, senior center, low-income housing, and childcare center.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nThe 1983 Hildt Amendment or Hildt Agreement (named after City Council member Michael Hildt) struck a balance between farmers and craftspeople in the daystalls which set a precedent for allocation of daystalls.\n[23] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Worth-23)\n[24] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-24)\nIn 1998, the PDA decided to end the Hildt Agreement;\n[25] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Jones-iv-25)\na new agreement, the Licata-Hildt agreement, was adopted in February 1999.\n[26] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-26)\nIn 2008, Seattle voters approved a six-year property-tax levy\n[27] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-27)\nto fund critical repairs and improvements, which were completed in 2012.\n[28] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-28)\nOperation\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=3)\n]\nOrganizations\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=4)\n]\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sisio%27s_Fruit_%26_Produce_at_Pike_Place_Market_(2015).jpg)\nFresh vegetables at the market\nThe Pike Place Market is overseen by the Pike Place Market Preservation & Development Authority (PDA), a\npublic development authority (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_development_authority)\nestablished under Washington State law. It is overseen by a 12-member volunteer council. Its members serve four-year terms. Four members are appointed by mayor, four by the current council, and four by the Pike Place Market Constituency. The Market PDA sets the policies by which the Pike Place Market is managed and hires an executive director to carry out those policies.\n[29] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-29)\n[30] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Market_organizations_official-30)\nEstablished in 1973, the PDA manages 80% of the properties in the city-recognized Market Historical District. Its founding law—the Market Charter—requires it to preserve, rehabilitate and protect the Market's buildings; increase opportunities for farm and food retailing in the Market; incubate and support small and marginal businesses; and provide services for low-income people. PDA revenues derive from the Market's tenants through rent, utilities, and other property management activities.\n[30] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Market_organizations_official-30)\n[31] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Market_organizations_merchant-31)\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PikePlaceMarket.jpg)\nPike Place Market at dawn, with the\nPike Place Fish Market (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Fish_Market)\ngetting ready for the day's trade\nThe same 1973 charter that established the PDA also established the Pike Place Market Constituency.

Anyone 16 years of age or older who lives in Washington State can become a member of the Constituency by paying $1 yearly dues.\n[30] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Market_organizations_official-30)\n[31] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Market_organizations_merchant-31)\nOperating independently of the PDA, the Market Historical Commission (established by the 1971 initiative to preserve the Market) has the specific mandate to preserve the Market's physical and social character as \"the soul of Seattle.\"\n[6] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-hist-dist-6)\nThe commission must approve any substantive change in the use or design of buildings and signage in the Historical District, even when these actions are taken by the PDA itself. Members of the 12-member commission are appointed to three-year terms by the mayor. At any time, the commission consists of two members each from the Friends of the Market, Inc.,\nAllied Arts of Seattle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_Arts_of_Seattle)\n, Inc., and the Seattle chapter of the\nAmerican Institute of Architects (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_of_Architects)\n; two owners of property within the district; two Market merchants, and two district residents. They meet 22 times a year. The Seattle Department of Neighborhoods provides them with a staff person, and the city's Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU) can enforce their decisions.\n[32] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Jones-5-32)\nAnother key organization in the affairs of the Market is the Pike Place Merchants Association.\n[33] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-merchants-mission-33)\nOfficially incorporated in 1973,\n[34] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Jones-22-34)\nit traces its history back to the Farm Association established in the 1920s. The association connects market vendors to legal, accounting, bookkeeping, business insurance, and health insurance services\n[33] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-merchants-mission-33)\nand provides free online advertising for its members. It also represents its members and attempts to advance their interests and opinions. All PDA tenants are required to be members; daystall vendors also have the option to join.\n[34] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Jones-22-34)\nSince 1974, the association has published the monthly\nPike Place Market News\n, which promotes the Market and its neighborhood.\n[31] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Market_organizations_merchant-31)\nFor over three decades, the association sponsored a\nMemorial Day (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day)\nfair at the market; financial difficulties caused cancellation of the fair in 2004.\n[35] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-35)\nA separate Daystall Tenants Association (DTA) formed in the late 1980s to represent the specific interests of daystall vendors. The DTA formed in response to proposed increases in daystall rental rates. Most members pay a $2 annual membership fee; the fee is optional. The DTA meets on the Desimone Bridge in the Market at least once each quarter. Similarly, the United Farmers Coalition (UFC) formed in 1998 to represent daystall farmers who sell produce, flower, and processed food; the UFC represents only these food vendors, as against craft vendors.\n[34] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Jones-22-34)\nThe Pike Market Performers' Guild, founded 2001, represents Market street performers.\n[36] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-36)\nAmong its members are\nArtis the Spoonman (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artis_the_Spoonman)\nand\nJim Page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Page_(singer))\n.\n[37] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-37)\nFriends of the Market, which spun out of Allied Arts in 1964 and over the next seven years spearheaded the activist work that saved the Market\n[38] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-38)\nis no longer a driving force in the Market. Still, as noted above, they have two seats on the Historical Commission. They also give tours of the Market.\n[39] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-39)\nThe Market Foundation (established 1982) was founded to support the Market's services for low-income people. The foundation now also supports heritage programs, improvements and repairs to historic buildings, and programs that assist the Market's farmers.\n[40] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Foundation-40)\nConflicts\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=5)\n]\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pike_Place_Market_-_apples_for_sale.jpg)\nFarmer selling apples in a daystall\nThe PDA is a public trustee charged with many potentially conflicting goals. Its charter mandates it to \"ensure that the traditional character of the Public Market is preserved.\" It is specifically mandated to\n...\nafford... a continuing opportunity for Public Market farmers, merchants, residents, shoppers, and visitors to carry on their tradition and market activities...  upgrad[e] structures and public amenities... initiate programs to expand food retailing in the Market Historical District, especially the sale of local farm produce; to preserve and expand the residential community, especially for low-income people; to promote the survival and predominance of small shops, marginal businesses, thrift shops, arts and crafts, and other enterprises, activities, and services which are essential to the functioning of the Public Market\n.\n[41] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-41)\nThe City Auditor's office has stated that there is an \"inherent conflict... between the PDA's need to operate the Market as a successful business entity and its Charter obligation to support small owner-operated tenant businesses.\"\n[42] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-42)\nAs early as 1974, a Seattle Department of Community Development study noted space conflicts between farmers and craft vendors.\n[43] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Jones-12-43)\nConflicts can be exacerbated because the stakeholders with conflicting needs are not talking to one another. Quoting the same City Auditor's report:\nMost Market tenants do not routinely communicate with tenants in other areas of the Market. As a result, they sometimes criticize the PDA for not implementing suggestions they believe would work for them and their close neighbors—e.g., closing all or part of Pike Place to auto traffic—not realizing that their \"solutions\" would create problems for tenants in other parts of the Market. Then they conclude that the PDA is not taking their comments and suggestions seriously\n.\n[44] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-44)\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PikePlaceMarket2006.jpg)\nA fishmonger's stall in the Main Arcade. Open-fronted, but rented on a lease, not as a daystall.\nLanguage barriers also play a role. For example, most of the flower vendors in the Market are\nHmong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_people)\n; during the difficult negotiations in 1999 over replacing the Hildt Agreement, many were apparently under a misimpression that the proposed agreement would have halved the vending space they received for a day's rent; in fact, this was unchanged.\n[45] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-45)\nFurther, the farmers who were the Market's original\nraison d'etre\ndo not necessarily do well when the Market becomes more of a tourist attraction than venue for shopping for produce and groceries.\n[46] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Seattle_Times_May_27,_2008-46)\n\"Craft vendors, antique and curio merchants, and booksellers…\" wrote the City Auditor's office, \"derive much of their business from tourists; fresh food vendors do not.\"\n[47] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-47)\nConversely, farmers have far more selling opportunities outside the Market than in the early and mid-20th century. As late as 1990, there were about ten farmers markets in Washington. By 1999 there were more than sixty. Most are seasonal weekend markets without most of the Pike Place Market's amenities, but they are not swarmed with tourists, parking is free or inexpensive and relatively plentiful, and food is the main focus of those markets, not crafts or flowers.\n[48] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-48)\nAs a result, increasingly Pike Place Market daystalls are devoted to flowers and crafts rather than edible produce. \"The Market,\" wrote the City Auditor's office,\n...\ncan be \"lost\" in either of two ways: It can stray from its traditional character or it can fail financially as a business entity. If the Market is to survive and thrive as a business entity in the face of increasing competition from other farmers' markets, modern full-service grocery stores, and retail shopping destinations in Seattle's Central Business District, the PDA must strike a balance between the Market's original old-world market character and modern business practices\n.\n[49] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-49)\nPolicies\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=6)\n]\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pike_Place_Market_-_Chop_carver.jpg)\nChinese\nseal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(East_Asia))\n(chop) carver at an outdoor craft daystall on Pike Place just south of Virginia Street\nThe Market's \"Meet the Producer\" mandate now includes craftspeople as well as farmers. Both can rent daystalls. Farmers take historic precedence, but the PDA \"acknowledges the rightful and permanent position of handmade arts and crafts as an integral use of the Market's Daystalls\" and their rules seek to encourage a lively mix.\n[50] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-regs-3-50)\nSome grandfathered vendors are allowed to sell merchandise not of their own making on essentially the same terms as craftspeople.\n[51] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-regs-4-51)\nCurrently, there are rules to make sure that new crafts vendors demonstrate themselves to be skilled craftspeople making their own wares with minimal use of assistants.\n[52] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-52)\nA standard Farm Table consists of two adjacent daystalls; a standard Craft Table is a single daystall. Daystalls are between 4 feet (1.2 m) and 5.5 feet (1.7 m) wide. Craftspeople have priority on the Desimone Bridge, the west side of the Market arcade north of the Desimone Bridge and the outdoor slabs between the arcade and Virginia Street; farmers have priority everywhere else. If farmers do not fill their priority tables, craftspeople may rent those, and\nvice versa\n.\n[51] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-regs-4-51)\nPriority is further set by separate seniority lists, one for farmers and one for craftspeople.\n[53] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-regs-6-53)\nFor farmers, other factors besides seniority come into play, mainly how often the person sells at the Market. Farmers can pass permits through their family.\n[54] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-54)\nThe rules for joint and family crafts businesses are far more complex.\n[55] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-55)\nWhile farmers and craftspeople may make some use of agents to sell on their behalf (including vendors functioning on different days as one another's agents), in order to maintain their seniority farmers must be physically present one day a week and craftspeople two days a week. To sell on a Saturday, vendors must sell at the Market a minimum of two weekdays of the preceding week. There are also allowances for taking vacations and sabbaticals without losing one's seniority. Senior Crafts Permit Holders—craftspeople who have sold in the Market for 30 years or more—need only rent (and use) a daystall once a week to maintain their seniority.\n[56] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-56)\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:13_Pike_Place_Market_flower_vendor_displays.jpg)\nFlowers for sale in Main Arcade daystalls\nThe definition of permitted farm products includes (among other items) produce, flowers, eggs, cultivated mushrooms, meat, cultured shellfish, and dairy products. There is also a broader category of supplemental farm products such as wild-harvested berries and mushrooms, non-edible bee products, or holiday wreaths. These may be sold in conjunction with permitted farm products, but there are strict limitations to prevent these from becoming anyone's primary products. Rules vary significantly at different times of year.\n[57] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-57)\nFarmers, craftspeople, and performers all must pay for an annual permit. As of 2008, the fee is $35 for farmers and craftspeople, $30 for performers. Craftspeople who vend off season—January through March—pay an additional $35 for a separate permit. For performers, this annual fee is their only fee. Farmers and craftspeople pay day rent for any daystalls they use. Depending on the season and the day of the week, a daystall may rent for anywhere from $5.85 for a stall on a Monday-Thursday off season to $32.85 on a Sunday in peak season. There are also separate rents for lockers and coolers.\n[58] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-regs-7-58)\nCompared to farmers and craftspeople, performers have a lesser role in the Market, but still one formally recognized by the PDA. \"The PDA's mission with regard to performers is to maintain locations within the Market where performing artists may entertain Market shoppers in a fashion consistent with and complimentary [\nsic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic)\n] to the needs of the Market's commercial business activities and Market residents.\n[50] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-regs-3-50)\nPerformers may receive donations and may display their recordings for sale, but prohibited from active solicitation of donations and from active sale of \"any product associated with the performance\".\n[53] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-regs-6-53)\nIn keeping with their lack of day fees, individual performers are not assigned specific places and times to perform. There are only positions in a (virtual) line for each marked, sanctioned performance location. Queuing runs on an honor system. Each performance is limited to one hour if any other licensed performer is waiting for the spot. Electronic amplification is not allowed, nor are brass instruments or drums. Certain performance locations are further limited to \"quiet\" performances where (for example) even hand-clap percussion is not allowed.\n[59] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-59)\nAlthough they do not have the same strict requirements as for daystalls, most commercial Market merchants are owner-operated businesses.\n[60] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Jones-42-60)\nIn the 1970s, when the Market was undergoing extensive rehabilitation and the future of the Market was somewhat unstable, the PDA consolidated its merchant base by giving merchant tenants very favorable leases, with longer terms and lower rates than were available elsewhere in Downtown Seattle. This policy was part of the reason that the PDA ran into the financial difficulties that led to its dealings with the Urban Group. The PDA now gives below-market rates only to start-up businesses, businesses or organizations designed to serve low and moderate income persons, and to \"the Market's unique character-defining businesses.\"\n[61] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-61)\nThe latter include produce, fish, and meat businesses.\n[62] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-62)\nThe PDA often will not renew multi-year leases for businesses with poor sales performance or other problems, but typically will allow them to remain indefinitely on a month-to-month basis.\n[63] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-63)\nAbout once a year, the PDA has occasion to refuse to renew when a merchant's lease ends.\n[60] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Jones-42-60)\nHousing and social services\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=7)\n]\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Balloon_man_Pike_Place_Market_Seattle_Washington.JPG)\nThomas the Balloon Man, longtime vendor\nThe Market is also a significant provider of low-income housing and social services.

A longtime Market vendor, Desimone was one of those who bought shares in the Market in 1925 and eventually became its owner by slowly buying out Arthur Goodwin.

His father, Jack Amon, began selling fish in the Market in 1911 as a partner in the Philadelphia Fish Market. From about 1920 to 1935, he owned and operated the American Fish Company. In 1951 he bought the Pure Food Fish Company (founded 1917–1918), which Sol Amon largely took over in 1956. Sol had worked in the Market since 1947 and has been sole proprietor of Pure Food Fish since his father's death in 1966. He can often be seen outside his stall chatting with visitors and helping them choose their fish, including a brisk tourist trade in salmon packed to travel. The\nSeattle City Council (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_City_Council)\nhonored him in 2006 on the 50th anniversary of his taking over the business: they named him \"King of the Market\" and permanently designated April 11 as Sol Amon Day.

Other NRHP-listed buildings near the Market but outside of those boundaries include the Guiry and Schillestad Building (Young Hotel or Guiry Building 1903, Mystic Hotel or Schillestad Building 1908), 2101–2111 1st Avenue; the Renaissance-style New Washington Hotel (now Josephinum Hotel, built 1900–1949), 1902 Second Avenue; and the\nMoore Theatre and Hotel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_Theatre_(Seattle,_Washington))\n(1907), 1932 2nd Avenue.\n[152] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-NRHP-2006-152)\n[153] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Crowley-Dorpat-88-153)\n[154] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-154)\n[155] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-155)\n[156] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-156)\n[157] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-157)\n[158] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-158)\nAlso in the Pike-Market neighborhood but outside the historic districts are at least two\ncity-designated landmark (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Landmarks_in_Seattle)\nnot on the NRHP: the Terminal Sales Building (1923–1925), 1932 1st Avenue; and Pier 59, now home to the\nSeattle Aquarium (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Aquarium)\n.\n[153] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Crowley-Dorpat-88-153)\n[159] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-159)\n[160] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-160)\nTransportation\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=16)\n]\nThe main arm of the market is located along the eponymous Pike Place, a two-block street that runs northwest for approximately 940 feet (290 m) between Pike Street and Virginia Street. From 1907 to 2025 the market was open to\none-way (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_road)\nautomobile traffic despite its heavy pedestrian use. While previously the street only closed to automobiles during some events, efforts to create a permanent\npedestrian zone (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_zone)\nhave resulted in an extended trial period starting in late April of 2025 despite having been opposed by some market vendors and business owners.\n[161] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-161)\n[162] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Times-CarFree-162)\nThe closing of the street to vehicular traffic has been described as a \"perennial issue\" by the PDA due to Pike Place Market's status as a working market and the need for loading zones,\n[162] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-Times-CarFree-162)\nwhich contrasts with overwhelming support from Seattle residents for restricting vehicles.\n[163] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-163)\nThe closure to vehicular traffic was originally scheduled from April to August 2025 due to nearby\nSeattle Public Utilities (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Public_Utilities)\nand\nPuget Sound Energy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound_Energy)\nprojects that resurfaced a section of Pike Place,\n[164] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-164)\nbut has since been extended to spring 2026. Market leaders cited positive feedback from customers and vendors, increased foot traffic, increased sales, and the need for more research as justification for the extension.\n[165] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-165)\n[166] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-166)\nThe market is located near the\nWestlake Center (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westlake_Center)\ntransit hub, which is served by a bus mall,\nLink light rail (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_light_rail)\nat\nWestlake station (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westlake_station_(Sound_Transit))\n, the\nSeattle Center Monorail (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Center_Monorail)\n, and\nSouth Lake Union Streetcar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Union_Streetcar)\n.\n[167] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-167)\nAn extension of the streetcar, named the Center City Connector, was planned to stop on 1st Avenue adjacent to the market but is on hold due to funding shortfalls.\n[168] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-168)\n[169] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_note-169)\nSee also\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=17)\n]\nPacific Northwest cuisine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest_cuisine)\nReferences\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=18)\n]\nFootnotes\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pike_Place_Market&action=edit&section=19)\n]\n^ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market#cite_ref-nris_1-0)\n\"National Register Information System\" (https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP)\n.\nNational Register of Historic Places (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places)\n.\nNational Park Service (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service)\n.

The Town of Seattle was disincorporated on January 18, 1867, and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869, when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2, 1869, with a\nmayor–council government (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor%E2%80%93council_government)\n.\n[27] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-founding-28)\n[36] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-37)\nThe corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date \"1869\" and a likeness of Chief Seattle in left profile.\n[37] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-38)\nThat same year, Seattle acquired the epithet of the \"Queen City\", a designation officially changed in 1982 to the \"Emerald City\".\n[38] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-39)\nSeattle has a history of boom-and-bust cycles, like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has risen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline, but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure.\n[39] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-shear-40)\nThe first such boom, covering the early years of the city, rode on the lumber industry. During this period the road now known as\nYesler Way (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesler_Way)\nwon the nickname \"Skid Road\", supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to\nHenry Yesler (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Yesler)\n's sawmill. The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as\nSkid Row (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skid_Row)\n.\n[40] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-yesler-41)\nLike much of the\nU.S. West (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States)\n, Seattle experienced conflicts between labor and management and ethnic tensions that culminated in the\nanti-Chinese riots of 1885–1886 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Seattle_before_1900#Relations_between_whites_and_Chinese)\n.\n[41] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-Kinnear_1911-42)\nThis violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle; anti-Chinese riots also occurred in\nTacoma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_riot_of_1885)\n.\nSeattle had achieved sufficient economic success when the\nGreat Seattle Fire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire)\nof 1889 destroyed the central business district. However, a far grander city center rapidly emerged in its place.\n[42] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-fire-43)\nFinance company\nWashington Mutual (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mutual)\n, for example, was founded in the immediate wake of the fire.\n[43] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-Klondike-foundings-44)\nThe\nPanic of 1893 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893)\nhit Seattle hard.\n[44] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-45)\nThe second and most dramatic boom resulted from the\nKlondike Gold Rush (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush)\n, which ended the depression that had begun with the\nPanic of 1893 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893)\n. In a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the\nS.S. Portland\ndocked with its famed \"ton of gold\", and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in\nAlaska (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska)\nand the\nYukon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon)\n. Few of those working men found lasting wealth. However, it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like\nEverett (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett,_Washington)\n,\nTacoma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington)\n,\nPort Townsend (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Townsend,_Washington)\n,\nBremerton (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremerton,_Washington)\n, and\nOlympia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Washington)\n, all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors for exchange, rather than\nmother lodes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_lode)\nfor extraction, of precious metals.\n[45] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-46)\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seattle_1870.jpg)\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seattle_1870.jpg)\nA September 1870 engraving of Seattle published in\nHarper's Magazine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Magazine)\n20th century\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pioneer_square.jpg)\nPioneer Square (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Square,_Seattle)\n, the\nPioneer Building (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Building_(Seattle,_Washington))\n, the\nSmith Tower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_Tower)\n, and the\nSeattle Hotel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Hotel)\nin 1917\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seattle_Monorail_under_construction_-_1961.jpg)\nThe\nSeattle Center Monorail (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Center_Monorail)\nunder construction in 1961\nThe boom lasted into the early part of the 20th century, and funded many new Seattle companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old\nJames E. Casey (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Casey)\nborrowed $100 from a friend and founded the\nAmerican Messenger Company (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Messenger_Company)\n(later\nUPS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service)\n). Other Seattle companies founded during this period include\nNordstrom (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom)\nand\nEddie Bauer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Bauer)\n.\n[43] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-Klondike-foundings-44)\nSeattle brought in the\nOlmsted Brothers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmsted_Brothers)\nlandscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards.\n[46] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-47)\nThe Gold Rush era culminated in the\nAlaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska%E2%80%93Yukon%E2%80%93Pacific_Exposition)\nof 1909, which is largely responsible for the layout of today's\nUniversity of Washington (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington)\ncampus.\n[47] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-aypexpo-48)\nA\nshipbuilding (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipbuilding)\nboom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during\nWorld War I (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I)\n, making Seattle somewhat of a company town. The subsequent retrenchment led to the\nSeattle General Strike of 1919 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_General_Strike)\n, an early\ngeneral strike (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike)\nin the country.\n[48] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-generalstrike-49)\nA 1912 city development plan by\nVirgil Bogue (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Bogue)\nwent largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the\nMaritime Strike of 1934 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Strike_of_1934)\ncost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the\nPort of Los Angeles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Los_Angeles)\n.\n[49] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-50)\nSeattle was one of the major cities that benefited from programs such as the\nWorks Progress Administration (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration)\n,\nCCC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps)\n,\nPublic Works Administration (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works_Administration)\n, and others.\n[50] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-51)\n[51] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-52)\nThe workers, mostly men, built roads, parks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record sites and buildings. Seattle faced significant unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries as\nLos Angeles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles)\nprevailed as the bigger\nWest Coast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States)\ncity. Seattle had building contracts that rivaled\nNew York City (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)\nand\nChicago (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago)\n, but also lost to Los Angeles. Seattle's eastern farm land faded due to\nOregon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon)\n's and the\nMidwest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States)\n's, forcing people into town.\n[52] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-53)\n[53] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-54)\nHooverville (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooverville)\narose during the Depression, leading to Seattle's growing homeless population. Stationed outside Seattle, the Hooverville housed thousands of men but very few children and no women. With work projects close to the city, Hooverville grew and the WPA settled into the city.\n[54] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-55)\nA movement of women arose from Seattle during the\nGreat Depression (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression)\n, fueled in part by\nEleanor Roosevelt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt)\n's 1933 book\nIt's Up to the Women\n; women pushed for recognition, not just as housewives, but as the backbone to family. Using newspapers and journals\nWorking Woman\nand\nThe Woman Today\n, women pushed to be seen as equal and receive some recognition.\n[55] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-56)\nThe Great Depression did not impact the\nUniversity of Washington (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington)\nnegatively. As schools across Washington lost funding and attendance, the university actually prospered during the time period as they focused on growing their student enrollment. While\nSeattle public schools (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Public_Schools)\nwere influenced by Washington's superintendent Worth McClure,\n[56] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-57)\nthey still struggled to pay teachers and maintain attendance.\n[57] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-58)\nSeattle was the home base of impresario\nAlexander Pantages (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pantages)\nwho, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting\nvaudeville (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville)\nacts and silent movies. He went on to become one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Scottish-born architect\nB. Marcus Priteca (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._Marcus_Priteca)\ndesigned several theaters for Pantages in Seattle, which were later demolished or converted to other uses. Seattle's surviving\nParamount Theatre (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Theatre_(Seattle))\n, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.\n[58] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-59)\nWar work again brought local prosperity during\nWorld War II (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II)\n, centered on the production of\nBoeing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing)\naircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the\nJapanese American internment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment)\n. After the World War II, however, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial\nairliner (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner)\nmarket.\n[59] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-60)\nSeattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the\nCentury 21 Exposition (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_21_Exposition)\n, the\n1962 World's Fair (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_21_Exposition)\n, for which the\nSpace Needle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle)\nwas built.\n[60] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-worldsfair-61)\nAnother major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the\noil crises (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis)\n, loss of government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the\nBoeing 747 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747)\n. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\"\n[61] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-62)\nSeattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago.\n[62] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-63)\nThe Seattle area is still home to Boeing's\nRenton narrow-body plant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Renton_Factory)\nand\nEverett wide-body plant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Everett_Factory)\n.\n[63] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-64)\nThe company's\ncredit union (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union)\nfor employees,\nBECU (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BECU)\n, remains based in the Seattle area and has been open to all residents of Washington since 2002.\n[64] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-65)\nOn March 20, 1970, twenty-eight people were killed when the Ozark Hotel was burned by an unknown arsonist.\n[65] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-66)\nThe\nWah Mee massacre (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wah_Mee_massacre)\nin 1983 resulted in the killing of 13 people in an illegal gambling club in the\nSeattle Chinatown-International District (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Chinatown-International_District)\n.\n[66] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle#cite_note-67)\nThe city's first\ncoffeehouses (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_in_Seattle)\nwere established in the late 1950s and grew over the following decades as espresso was introduced to the American market.

These were closed in 2000 to make way for\nSkyCity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyCity)\n, a larger restaurant featuring Pacific Northwest cuisine, which closed in 2017. In 1993, the elevators were replaced with new computerized versions. The new elevators descend at a rate of 10 mph (16 km/h).\nOn\nDecember 31 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve)\n, 1999, a powerful beam of light was unveiled for the first time. Known as the Legacy Light or Skybeam, it is powered by lamps that total 85 million\ncandela (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela)\nshining skyward from the top of the Space Needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in Seattle. The concept of this beam was derived from the\nofficial 1962 World's Fair poster (https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/digital/collection/imlsmohai/id/22)\n, which depicted such a light source (although none was incorporated into the building's original design).

Carlson, chairman of the 1962\nWorld's Fair (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Fair)\nin Seattle, had an idea for erecting a tower with a restaurant at the World's Fair. The president of\nWestern International Hotels (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_International_Hotels)\n, he had been inspired by a recent visit to the\nStuttgart Tower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm_Stuttgart)\nin\nGermany (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)\n.\n[17] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle#cite_note-Chicago-1983-17)\n[18] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle#cite_note-18)\nLocal architect John Graham soon became involved as a result of his success in designing\nNorthgate Mall (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northgate_Mall_(Seattle))\n. Graham's first move was to alter the restaurant's original design to a\nrevolving restaurant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_restaurant)\n, similar to his previous design of the\nLa Ronde (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ronde_(restaurant))\ntower restaurant at the\nAla Moana Center (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ala_Moana_Center)\nin\nHonolulu (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu)\n.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nAmong the names proposed for the structure by Carlson, Graham, and Steinbrueck were the \"Space Needle\", \"Star Tickler\", \"Top Hat\", and \"Big\nSkookum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skookum)\n\".\n[9] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle#cite_note-Crosscut-Podcast-9)\nThe proposed Space Needle had no pre-selected site. Since it was not financed by the city, land had to be purchased within the fairgrounds. The investors had been unable to find suitable land and the search for a site was nearly dead when, in 1961, they discovered a lot, 120 by 120 ft (37 by 37 m), containing switching equipment for the fire and police alarm systems. The land, which originally had the neighborhood's fire station until 1921, was sold by the city for $75,000.\n[19] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle#cite_note-19)\nGeotechnical engineers quickly tested and approved the site for construction. At this point, only one year remained before the World's Fair would begin. The Needle was privately financed and built by the Pentagram Corporation, consisting of\nBagley Wright (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagley_Wright)\n, contractor\nHoward S. Wright (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_S._Wright)\n, architect\nJohn Graham (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graham_%26_Associates)\n,\nNed Skinner (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Skinner)\n, and\nNorton Clapp (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Clapp)\n. In 1977, Bagley, Skinner, and Clapp sold their interest to the Howard Wright Company, which now controls it under the name of Space Needle Corporation.\n[20] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle#cite_note-20)\nThe concrete base of the Space Needle is 30 ft (9.1 m) deep and 120 ft (37 m) across, and took 467 redi-mix trucks one full day to fill. The foundation weighs 5,850 short tons (5,310 metric tons) (including 250 short tons or 230 metric tons of reinforcing steel), the same as the above-ground structure. The tower is secured to the foundation with 72 30 ft (9.1 m) long bolts.\nWith time an issue, the construction team worked around the clock. The domed top, housing the top five levels (including the restaurants and observation deck), was perfectly balanced so that the restaurant could rotate with the help of one tiny electric motor, originally 0.8 kilowatts (1.1 hp), later replaced with a 1.1 kilowatts (1.5 hp) motor. Painted in Orbital Olive paint for the body, Astronaut White for the legs, Re-entry Red for the saucer, and Galaxy Gold for the roof, the Space Needle was finished in less than one year. It was completed in April 1962 at a cost of $4.5 million. The last elevator car was installed the day before the Fair opened on April 21. During the course of the Fair, nearly 20,000 people a day rode to the Observation Deck, culminating to a total of 2.56 million visitors.   Upon completion, the Space Needle was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River, replacing the\nKansas City Power and Light Building (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Power_and_Light_Building)\nwhich had held that distinction since 1931. It also replaced the\nSmith Tower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_Tower)\nin downtown Seattle as the tallest building on the American west coast, which it had been since 1914.\n[No Text] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Space_Needle_at_World%27s_Fair,_1962.jpg)\nCompleted Space Needle after the opening of the World's Fair - April 1962\nThe revolving restaurant was operated by Carlson's Western International Hotels\n[21] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle#cite_note-21)\nunder a 20-year contract from April 1, 1962, to April 1, 1982.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nCarillon\n[\nedit (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_Needle&action=edit&section=4)\n]\nAn\nimitation carillon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_carillon)\n(using recordings of\nbells (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell)\n, rather than live bells) was installed in the Space Needle, and played several times a day during the World's Fair.\n[\ncitation needed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\n]\nThe instrument, built by the Schulmerich Bells Company of\nHatfield, Pennsylvania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield,_Pennsylvania)\n[22] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle#cite_note-22)\n[23] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle#cite_note-23)\nunder the name \"Carillon Americana\", recreated the sounds of 538 bells and was the\nlargest in the world (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_carillons)\n, until eclipsed by a 732 bell instrument at the\n1964 New York World's Fair (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair)\n. The operator's console was located in the base of the Space Needle, completely enclosed in glass to allow observation of the musician playing the instrument. It was also capable of being played from a roll, like a player piano. The forty-four stentors (speakers) of the carillon were located underneath the Needle's disc at the 200-foot (61 m) level and were audible over the entire fairgrounds and up to ten miles (16 km) away.\n[24] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle#cite_note-24)\nThe carillon was disassembled after the fair's close.\nThe Carillon Americana was featured on a 12-track\nLP record (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record)\ncalled \"Bells On High-Fi\" (catalog number AR-8, produced by Americana Records, of\nSellersville, Pennsylvania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellersville,_Pennsylvania)\n).
