We would like to acknowledge Aarsh Batra for providing excellent data analysis and Avi Sharma for his support in generating \n\nmaps for this manuscript. Dear Friends and Colleagues, \n\nWe’re pleased to bring you the latest data from the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI). This data shows that fine particulate air pollution \n\nremains the greatest external threat to public health. But pollution is also unequally distributed amongst the world, with those \n\nbreathing the dirtiest air (top quintile) expected to see almost 3 years cut from their lives if high pollution persists compared to \n\nthose breathing the cleanest air (bottom quintile). \n\nIn this year’s report we build off a theme from last year: that pollution is unequal because the basic tools and infrastructure \n\ncountries have to fight pollution is unequal. The missing tools we highlighted last year focused on funding availability, monitoring \n\nand open data access. To help confront this global challenge, this year we launched a new initiative—the EPIC Air Quality Fund— \n\nto support local groups and organizations in installing monitors and providing open data to communities that could benefit the \n\nmost. Providing this data allows citizens to understand the depth of the pollution problem where they live and call for change. \n\nOpen access to data also provides a necessary guidepost for setting and evaluating air quality standards—the theme of this \n\nyear’s report. Our report shows that if countries adopt ambitious standards and implement policies to achieve them, global \n\nlife expectancy would significantly improve. These standards—some strong and some weak—reflect the multiple policy goals \n\ncountries have as they balance economic, environmental, and health goals. However, more than three-quarters of countries and \n\nterritories around the world are not meeting their national pollution standards or have not even set a standard. \n\nWhile the AQLI Annual Report highlights where standards have not been met, and policies are failing, it’s important to also \n\nhighlight the success stories that can aid other parts of the world. Throughout history countries like the United States, Europe, \n\nJapan, and, most recently, China have been able to significantly reduce air pollution thanks to strong policies (policies that came \n\nonly after a persistent, public call for change). China, for example, now meets its national standard and residents are living two \n\nyears longer because of the policy changes that have significantly reduced pollution since the country declared a war against it \n\nin 2014. Building on this success, China is now aiming for a further 10 percent reduction in particulate concentrations across its \n\nprefectures by 2025, compared to 2020 levels. \n\nIndia’s national standard is similar to China’s, but only 60 percent of the population breathes air that meets this standard. \n\nFortunately, India is responding by implementing innovative policies. In 2019, the state of Gujarat—in collaboration with \n\nGreenstone and colleagues—launched the world’s first market for particulate pollution. The market has since reduced pollution \n\nby 20-30 percent in the city of Surat, and is rapidly expanding to other cities and states. These types of innovative policies \n\ndemonstrate that it is possible to achieve improvements in air quality and people’s health, without unduly impeding economic \n\ngrowth (in this case, it increased economic growth). \n\nEPIC will continue to bring data about the pollution people breathe to communities who would benefit the most through our Air \n\nQuality Fund, effectively communicate how this pollution impacts their health through the AQLI, and work with governments \n\non the ground to devise and test policies that reduce this pollution at the least cost. This multi-pronged strategy aims to not just \n\nexpose the problem—that widespread pollution is causing the average person on the planet to lose 1.9 years off their life—but to \n\nalso help solve it. \n\nSincerely, \n\nMichael Greenstone \n\nMilton Friedman \n\nDistinguished Service Professor \n\nDirector, EPIC \n\nChrista Hasenkopf \n\nDirector, Clean Air Program \n\nEPIC \n\nTanushree Ganguly \n\nDirector, AQLI \n\nEPIC   \n\n> AQLI 2024 Annual Update | 5\n\n# At a Glance \n\nWhile global pollution declined slightly in 2022, it is still the \n\ngreatest external threat to human life expectancy. \n\n• The AQLI’s 2022 data reveals that permanently reducing global \n\nPM 2.5  pollution to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) \n\nguideline of 5 μg/m³ would add 1.9 years onto average human life \n\nexpectancy—or a combined 14.9 billion life years. \n\n• The impact of PM 2.5  on global life expectancy is comparable \n\nto that of smoking, 1.3 times that of childhood and maternal \n\nmalnutrition, 4.4 times that of high alcohol use, 5.8 times that \n\nof transport injuries like car crashes and unsafe water, and 6.7 \n\ntimes that of HIV/AIDS. 1\n\nPollution is highly unequal around the world, and so are policy \n\nambitions. \n\n• People in the most polluted areas of the world breathe air that is \n\nsix times more polluted than those in the least polluted areas. As \n\na result, their life expectancy is reduced by an average of 2.7 years \n\ncompared to those living in the cleanest places. \n\n• National air quality standards—an important tool to set strong \n\npolicies—vary significantly, with some countries enforcing strict \n\nlimits as low as the WHO guideline, others setting looser limits \n\nup to 50 μg/m³, and some having no standards at all. \n\nMany countries with national standards are not meeting them, \n\nimpacting life expectancy. \n\n• Ninety-four out of 252 countries and territories globally have \n\nnational standards, making up 80 percent of the world’s \n\npopulation. 2 However, 37 of those countries aren’t meeting them, \n\nmaking up 30 percent of the world’s population. \n\n• If all countries and territories with standards met them, the \n\naverage person living in these regions would add 1.2 years onto \n\ntheir lives.       \n\n> 1Global Burden of Disease ( https:/ /vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/ ) level-2\n> causes and risks data and WHO Life Tables (https:/ /apps.who.int/gho/data/\n> node. main.LIFECOUNTRY?lang=en) were combined with the Life table method\n> to arrive at these results. “PM 2.5 relative to WHO Guideline” bar displays the\n> reduction in life expectancy relative to the WHO guideline as calculated by latest\n> AQLI (2022) data\n> 2AQLI’s compilation of country-level national ambient PM 2.5 standards can be\n> found here ( Country_annual_average_pm2.5_standards_July2024 - Google\n> Sheets) . The information in this sheet is updated to the best of our knowledge.\n> We encourage readers to reach out if information provided here is incorrect,\n> missing, or has been updated.\n\nWhen countries enforce and meet their national standards, \n\nlife expectancy improves. \n\n• Because of stringent policies, the United States and Europe have \n\nsignificantly reduced pollution—now accounting for only 3.9 \n\npercent of the health burden from particulate pollution globally. \n\nBoth regions have introduced or enacted even more stringent \n\nstandards over the last year, which if met would result in an \n\naverage gain in life expectancy of 1.3 months and 4 months in the \n\nUnited States and Europe, respectively. \n\n• China has also succeeded in meeting its national standards. \n\nResidents are now living 2 years longer because of the policy \n\nchanges that have significantly reduced pollution since the \n\ncountry declared a war against it in 2014. \n\n• While India’s national standard is similar to China’s, only 60 \n\npercent of the population breathes air that meets this standard. \n\nFortunately, India is responding by implementing innovative \n\npolicies. In 2019, the state of Gujarat launched the world’s first \n\nmarket for particulate pollution. The market has since reduced \n\npollution by 20-30 percent in the city of Surat and is rapidly \n\nexpanding to other cities and states. \n\nMany countries without national standards are highly polluted \n\nand lack critical tools. \n\n• More than half of all countries and territories around the \n\nworld—158 out of 252—don’t have a pollution standard at all. \n\nThose countries make up 12.4 percent of the health burden from \n\nparticulate pollution globally. Only one-third of the countries that \n\ndon’t have standards show evidence of government monitoring, \n\nand less than 1 percent of these countries have fully open data. \n\nWith little data, it is difficult to set pollution standards and \n\nenforce them. \n\n• To help confront this challenge, this year EPIC launched the \n\nEPIC Air Quality Fund to support local groups and organizations \n\nin installing monitors and providing open data to communities \n\nthat could benefit the most. \n\nThe decline in global pollution in 2022 was due almost entirely \n\nto a trend reversal in South and Southeast Asia, while pollution \n\nis on the rise in the Middle East and North Africa and Sub-\n\nSaharan Africa. \n\n• Global pollution declined in 2022 almost entirely due to a \n\ntrend reversal in South Asia—with an 18 percent decline in   \n\n> 6| 2024 Annual Update AQLI\n\npollution over one year (and to a lesser extent, Southeast Asia, \n\nwith a 4.8 percent decline). Though it is difficult to conclusively \n\ndetermine the reasons for this decline, meteorological causes— \n\nsuch as above normal rainfall—likely played a strong role. While \n\npollution declined slightly, the region remains the most polluted \n\nin the world, with residents set to lose 3.5 years of life expectancy \n\nif South Asia does not meet the WHO guideline. \n\n• While pollution declined in the South and Southeast Asia, \n\npollution levels increased across the Middle East and African \n\ncontinent. 3 In the Middle East and North African (MENA) \n\nregions, concentrations increased by 13 percent. If pollution were \n\nreduced to meet the WHO guideline, people living in this region   \n\n> 3All region definitions used in this report can be found here: AQLI AR 2024\n> Regions - Google Sheets\n\nwould gain 1.3 years of life expectancy. \n\nPollution is on par with known threats to life in local regions. \n\n• In Central and Western Africa, air pollution is now as much of a \n\nhealth threat as well-known killers in the region like HIV/AIDS, \n\nmalaria and unsafe water. An average resident of this region will \n\nlose 1.7 years off their lives if pollution persists at current levels. \n\n• The health threat posed by particulate pollution is greater or \n\ncomparable to that of suicide and violence in many parts of South \n\nAmerica. For example, in Boliva—the most polluted country in \n\nLatin America—its toll on life expectancy is nine times higher \n\nthan that of suicide and violence. In Colombia, the impact is \n\nabout comparable.   \n\n> 2.0 1.0 0.5 5.0 ≥6.0 4.0 3.0 00.1 Potential gain in life expectancy (in years)\n> AQLI 2024 Annual Update | 7\n\nPARTICULATE POLLUTION DROPPED FROM PREVIOUS \n\nYEARS BUT IS STILL FAR FROM SAFE: 2022 GLOBAL UPDATE \n\nNew and revised satellite-derived  PM 2.5  data show a reduction in \n\nglobal population-weighted  PM 2.5  levels—reducing from 26.6  μg/m³ \n\nin 2021 to 24.2  μg/m³  in 2022. The AQLI shows that reducing global \n\nPM 2.5  pollution to meet the WHO guideline would add 1.9 years onto \n\naverage life expectancy, translating to a total gain of 14.9 billion \n\nyears—making particulate pollution the greatest threat to human \n\nhealth. This burden of particulate pollution on life expectancy \n\nis comparable to that of tobacco use, 1.3 times that of childhood \n\nand maternal malnutrition, 4.4 times that of high alcohol use, 5.8 \n\ntimes that of transport injuries or unsafe water, handwashing \n\nand sanitation, 6.7 times that of HIV/AIDS, and 26.7 times that of \n\nnutritional deficiencies (Figure 1.1). \n\nPROGRESS IN SOUTH ASIA, BUT HIGHER AIR POLLUTION IN \n\nAFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST \n\nGlobal particulate pollution concentrations continue to remain \n\nfairly constant over the past two decades, with pollution declining \n\nin some regions and increasing in others. While China’s decline in \n\npollution continued in 2022—reducing its pollution by 41 percent \n\nsince it began its “war on pollution” and extending its population’s \n\naverage life expectancy by 2 years if sustained— South Asia made a \n\nsignificant trend reversal in 2022 (Figure 1.2). Instead of its pollution \n\nsteadily increasing as it has for at least the last two decades, the \n\nregion saw a sharp decline in pollution of 18 percent from 2021 to \n\n2022 (50.7 to 41.4  μg/m³ ) . Had the pollution levels in South Asia not \n\ndeclined, global pollution levels would have remained the same as \n\nlast year. \n\nThe South Asian decline from 2021 to 2022 is the largest single year \n\ndecline for a region in the data since the beginning of its collection \n\nin 1998. If the decline is sustained, it would translate into 0.9 years \n\nof life expectancy gained compared to 2021 levels. \n\nWith the evidence currently available, it is difficult to conclusively \n\ndetermine what accounts for reduced particulate pollution levels \n\nin South Asia in 2022.  PM 2.5  concentrations were lower in all South \n\nSection 1 \n\n# Global pollution levels drop, but \n\n# countries fail to meet their own \n\n# pollution standards \n\nFigure 1.1 ·  Selected major threats to life expectancy \n\nSources: Global Burden of Disease ( https:/ /vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/ ) level-2 causes and risks data and WHO Life Tables  (https:/ /apps.who.int/gho/data/ \n\nnode. main.LIFECOUNTRY?lang=en)  were combined with the Life table method to arrive at these results. “PM 2.5  relative to WHO Guideline” bar displays the reduction \n\nin life expectancy relative to the WHO guideline as calculated by latest AQLI (2022) data \n\n8 | 2024 Annual Update  AQLI Asian countries except Sri Lanka. At the country level, the highest \n\ndecline was observed in Bangladesh followed by India and Nepal. \n\nIn some districts of Dhaka and Chittagong in Bangladesh and West \n\nBengal and Jharkhand in India, reductions in  PM 2.5  concentrations \n\nrelative to 2021 are higher than 20  μg/m³ .\n\nRecent evidence from India 4 suggests that favorable meteorological \n\nconditions amplified the impact of the small decreases in emissions \n\nof  PM 2.5  particles and  PM 2.5  precursors (SO 2, NO x, NH 3) in the country. \n\nThis coupled with the fact that the decline was region-wide, suggests \n\nthat meteorology could have played a significant role in reducing \n\npollution levels across South Asia. Evidence also points to above \n\nnormal rainfall in many parts of South Asia in 2022  5 and higher \n\nprecipitation has been linked with lower pollution levels. While \n\nit is difficult to conclusively determine what reduced  PM 2.5  levels \n\nacross South Asia, it is safe to posit that favorable meteorological \n\nconditions may have played a part. Moving forward, continued \n\nobservations, efforts towards policy enforcement and monitoring \n\nimpacts of policy interventions will be critical for understanding \n\nand sustaining these reductions. \n\nDespite this improvement, South Asia remains the world’s most \n\npolluted region, with residents breathing air that is eight times more \n\npolluted than what the WHO has deemed safe. If pollution were \n\npermanently reduced to meet the WHO guideline, people living in \n\nthis region could see 3.6 years added onto their lives. \n\nWhile news from South Asia—the most widely covered region \n\nin the media for its air pollution challenges—was positive,  PM 2.5 \n\nestimates suggest that the Middle East and North Africa is emerging \n\nas a pollution hotspot.  PM 2.5  in this region increased by 13 percent \n\ncompared to 2021. While difficult to conclusively determine what       \n\n> 4Yuanyu Xie, Mi Zhou, Kieran M. R. Hunt, and Denise L.

That \n\nmeans that pollution in the most polluted places is cutting 2.7 \n\nmore years off the lives of those living in them compared to those \n\nin the cleanest places. \n\nWhile geographic terrain and meteorological factors can have an \n\ninfluence on pollution, varying policy ambitions in the form of \n\nclean air standards or emission reduction goals—and the ability of \n\ncountries to enforce them—are a primary determinant of pollution \n\nlevels. Policy ambitions vary significantly among countries, with \n\nsome countries setting strict national air quality standards, others \n\nsetting weaker ones, and still others setting none (Figure 1.4a). A \n\nnational air quality standard is critical to efforts to reduce pollution \n\nbecause it allows policymakers to have a guidepost to use to set \n\npolicy goals and evaluate their success. Out of the 252 countries \n\nand territories analyzed in this report, 94 countries that are home \n\nto more than 81 percent of the world’s population have air quality \n\nstandards for  PM 2.5 .7\n\nOf course, countries set air quality standards to reflect multiple    \n\n> 6World Bank. 2022. “Middle East And North Africa Development Report: Blue\n> Skies, Blue Seas Air Pollution, Marine Plastics, and Coastal Erosion in the Middle\n> East and North Africa” https:/ /openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/\n> bitstreams/9125cb69-90b8-53b0-b645-800b33e9d1ee/content\n> 7Refer Footnote 2\n\nFigure 1.2 ·  Global and select regional annual average PM 2.5  concentrations, 1998-2022   \n\n> Note: South Asia is defined as the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka.

For example, they may perceive that the costs \n\nfrom stricter air pollution policies in terms of industrialization and \n\neconomic prosperity may exceed the benefits in their countries. \n\nThere are also a variety of distributional considerations—factors \n\nrelated to fairness and equity—that enter countries' decision-\n\nmaking. \n\nCountries have differing degrees of success in achieving their \n\nstandards. The enforcement of standards requires commitment \n\nto enforce reductions on a multitude of polluters, both mobile (e.g., \n\nvehicles) and stationary (e.g., factories and power plants). This can \n\nbe especially challenging in countries with weaker state capacity. \n\nIndeed, countries’ track records are quite mixed. For instance, in \n\nIndia, environmental regulatory institutions are often viewed as \n\nsuboptimal. 8 Despite similar governance structures for air and \n\nwater pollution in India, their effectiveness varies significantly. \n\nAir pollution regulations have proven more impactful compared \n\nto water pollution regulations. This discrepancy is attributed \n\nto greater citizen engagement and judicial intervention in air \n\npollution issues compared to water pollution. 9\n\nFurther, environmental standards can often have unintended \n\nconsequences. In the case of tightening vehicle exhaust emission \n\nstandards in the United States, it has been found that while the \n\nnew standards have been effective in reducing emissions from new \n\nvehicles, they have made new cars more expensive — increasing \n\nthe demand for older, dirtier vehicles as an alternative. It has been \n\nestimated that more than two-thirds of pollution emissions in a \n\nyear can be attributed to vehicles older than 10 years. 10  This makes \n\na case for assessing effectiveness of tighter standards and focusing       \n\n> 8Center for policy research. 2022. “The State of India’s Pollution Control\n> Boards – A Series of Papers” https:/ /cprindia.org/workingpapers/\n> the-state-of-indias-pollution-control-boards/\n> 9Michael Greenstone, and Rema Hanna. 2014. “Environmental Regulations, Air\n> and Water Pollution, and Infant Mortality in India” American Economic Review\n> 2014, 104(10): 3038–3072” https:/ /www.theigc.org/sites/default/files/2016/06/\n> Greenstone_Hanna.pdf\n> 10 Kleiman center for energy policy. 2022. “How Effective Are Vehicle Exhaust\n> Standards?” https:/ /kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/\n> KCEP-Digest-How-Effective-Are-Vehicle-Exhaust-Standards.pdf\n\non ways in which standards can be better enforced. \n\nThese are just a few examples of the many considerations that play \n\ninto a country's decision making around ambient air quality \n\nstandards, thereby, resulting in countries having different \n\nstandards. South Asia is a good example of these nuances. In India, \n\nwhere the annual  PM 2.5  standard is 40 μg/m³, more than 40 percent \n\nof the population breathes air that exceeds the standard. In 2021, \n\nBangladesh revised its annual  PM 2.5  standard from 15  μg/m³  to 35 \n\nμg/m³ . In 2022, 96.8 percent of Bangladesh’s population breathed \n\nair that did not meet this revised standard. In Pakistan, where \n\npollution levels are like those in India and Bangladesh, the  PM 2.5 \n\nstandard is much stricter (set at 15 μg/m³), and virtually the \n\ncountry’s entire population breathes air that doesn’t meet the \n\nstandard. \n\n37 out of the 94 countries and territories with standards—home \n\nto 30 percent of global population—don't meet their national \n\nstandards (Figure 1.4b). If they did, an average person living in these \n\ncountries could live 1.17 years longer. Iraq, Bangladesh, and Pakistan \n\nwould see the highest benefits, with life expectancies increasing \n\nby 2.2 years, 1.9 years, and 2.3 years, respectively (Figure 1.4c). \n\nHowever, the ability to meet standards is a problem even in regions \n\nof the world that are cleaner and that have stronger limits. While \n\nthe European Union has recently set a much stricter 2030 target \n\nof 10  μg/m³  for  PM 2.5 , the pollution levels in the countries of Bulgaria, \n\nCroatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Poland, \n\nRomania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, exceed this tighter standard. More \n\nthan 75 percent of the population in these countries breathes air \n\nthat doesn’t meet the standard. If these countries were to meet \n\nthis 2030  PM 2.5  limit, the life expectancy of an average resident in \n\nthese countries could go up by 4 months. \n\nA standard—even one not quite achieved yet—is still better than \n\nno standard at all. While 94 countries and territories have a standard, \n\neven more—158—do not have a standard. Countries like the \n\nRepublic of Congo, Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea––where \n\npollution is among the highest in the world—do not have a pollution \n\nstandard. The fact that one-third of the countries without air quality \n\nFigure 1.3 ·  Difference in life expectancies of the least and most polluted regions across the world   \n\n> 10 | 2024 Annual Update AQLI\n\nstandards show no evidence of government monitoring, and less \n\nthan 1 percent have open data, further compounds the challenge \n\nof setting and enforcing standards. \n\nIt's important to note that particulate concentrations used to assess \n\ncompliance with national air quality standards exclude \n\ncontributions from dust and sea salt. While these components are \n\nnot excluded in regulatory compliance assessments, our findings \n\nshow that even without them, many countries still fail to meet their \n\nnational standards. \n\nThe remainder of this report will describe how pollution levels have changed \n\nover time in different parts of the world, briefly explore relevant policy measures \n\nthat countries have implemented, and highlight how people across the globe \n\nwould live longer if they were to breathe cleaner air. \n\nFigure 1.4a ·  Patchwork of standards \n\nFigure 1.4b ·  Countries meeting and not meeting their national air quality standards \n\nFigure 1.4c ·  Potential gain in life expectancy if countries were to meet their own PM 2.5  standards 1\n\n1 Particulate concentrations used to assess compliance with national air quality standards exclude contributions from dust and sea salt  \n\n> Ambient Annual PM 2.5 standard (μg/m³) 40-50 30-40 20-30 10-20 5-10 Does not have a standard\n> Meets Air Quality Standard?

In \n\n2022, the  PM 2.5  levels were 41.4  μg/m³ — an approximate 14 percent \n\ndecline compared to the decade’s average—which is equivalent to \n\na potential gain in life expectancy of 7.9 months, if these reductions \n\nare sustained. \n\nRelative to 2021,  PM 2.5  levels were lower in all South Asian countries \n\nwith the exception of Sri Lanka. The decline in Bangladesh was the \n\nsteepest, where annual  PM 2.5  concentrations were lower by more \n\nthan 15  μg/m³ .

In addition to a heavy monsoon \n\nspell, Bangladesh experienced a cyclonic storm and heavy rainfall \n\nin October 2022 and flood events in June and July. Afghanistan \n\nexperienced flood events in May. \n\nAvailable evidence explaining the reduction in India’s  PM 2.5  levels \n\nand the region-wide decline in South Asia suggests favorable \n\nmeteorology may have contributed to the decline in South Asia’s \n\nPM 2.5  concentrations in 2022. These favorable conditions may not \n\npersist year to year, and especially under expected future climate \n\nchanges, suggesting that these reductions may be temporary. 16 \n\nThis reinforces the need for sustained policy measures aimed at \n\nemission control across the South Asian region. \n\nDespite having cleaner air compared to previous years, South \n\nAsia remains the world’s most polluted region, accounting for 45 \n\npercent of the total life years lost globally due to high pollution. \n\nBangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan—where 23.2 percent of the \n\nglobal population lives—are among the most polluted countries in \n\nthe world. In each of these four countries, the impact of particulate \n\npollution on life expectancy is substantially higher than that of \n\nother large health threats (Figure 2.2). Tobacco use, for instance, \n\nreduces life expectancy in these countries by as much as 2 years; \n\nunsafe water and sanitation by as much as 1 year; and alcohol use \n\nby half a year. \n\nThe average resident of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan is \n\nexposed to particulate pollution levels that are 22.3 percent higher   \n\n> 15 Refer to Footnote 4\n> 16 Refer to Footnote 4\n\nthan at the turn of the century. Had pollution levels in 2000 \n\nremained constant over time, the residents in these countries would \n\nbe on track to lose 2.8 years of life expectancy—not the 3.5 years that \n\nthey stand to lose in 2022. 17 \n\nBangladesh has consistently emerged as the most polluted \n\nSouth Asian country. Despite a 20 percent decline in particulate \n\nconcentration in 2022 relative to 2021, Bangladesh’s annual average \n\nPM 2.5  level was 54.2  μg/m³  in 2022—more than 10 times the WHO \n\nguideline. Home to 166.4 million people, the average resident \n\nin Bangladesh is likely to lose 4.8 years of life expectancy if the \n\npollution level persists. In Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh and the \n\nsecond most polluted megacity in the world, with an annual average \n\nparticulate pollution of 61.7 μg/m³—more than 12 times the WHO \n\nguideline—an average resident would live 5.6 years longer if the \n\nparticulate levels met the WHO guideline. In the most polluted part \n\nof the country—Gazipur district in the Dhaka division—residents \n\nwould live 6.3 years longer if the WHO guideline was permanently \n\nmet. Even in the least polluted part of the country––Sylhet district \n\nin the Sylhet division—residents are losing more years of life \n\nexpectancy than the global average compared to if they were to \n\npermanently meet the WHO guideline (2.8 years vs. 1.8 years). \n\nAlthough Bangladesh is the most polluted country overall, India \n\nfaces the highest health burden of air pollution on account of the \n\nlarge population that is exposed. Despite a 19.3 percent drop in \n\nparticulate levels in 2022 compared to 2021, an average resident \n\nin India is likely to lose 3.4 years of life expectancy if pollution \n\nlevels persist.

If these \n\nlevels are sustained in the years to come, the life expectancy in the \n\nNorthern Plains could increase by 1.2 years. Although 2022 was \n\ncleaner compared to previous years, the average resident in this \n\nregion is still likely to lose about 5.4 years of life expectancy if the \n\npollution level persists—which implies that there is significant \n\nscope for further strengthening mitigation efforts. \n\nBeyond the Northern Plains, the states of Maharashtra, Madhya \n\nPradesh and Rajasthan have the highest burden of pollution in the \n\ncountry. On average, the 292.3 million people living in these states \n\nare now losing 2.9 years of life expectancy. \n\nIn Nepal, where the  PM 2.5  concentration was 39.2  μg/m³  in 2022 \n\n—18.2 percent lower relative to 2021, the average resident would \n\nlive 3.4 years longer if the country met the WHO guideline.

Stepping back, pollution levels have \n\nconsistently increased in the region over the last two decades. \n\nRapid industrialization, economic development, and population \n\ngrowth have led to skyrocketing energy demand and fossil fuel use \n\nacross the region.

These rules are \n\nestablished under the “Bangladesh Environment Conservation \n\nAct 1995” and create the National Air Quality Control Plan and the \n\nAir Pollution Prevention Plan, identify air pollution activities, and \n\nestablish standards for emissions from industry, automobiles, and \n\nspecific projects (power generation, textiles, cement, fertilizers, \n\netc.). 23  In Dhaka, Bangladesh, where brick kilns are responsible for \n\n58 percent of the particulate pollution, the law governing brick kiln \n\nproduction was amended in 2019 to prohibit the establishment \n\nof brick kilns near residential, commercial, agricultural, and \n\nenvironmentally sensitive areas. 24  In addition, the government is \n\nplanning to phase out the use of bricks in favor of concrete blocks \n\nby 2025 in order to lessen the damage to both the quality of the \n\nair and topsoil. 25  Further, Bangladesh’s real-time air pollution \n\nmeasurements now cover eight of its cities with plans to extend \n\nit to five more cities.  26 \n\nIn India, the country with the highest health burden of pollution \n\nin South Asia, the Government launched its National Clean Air \n\nProgramme (“NCAP”) in 2019 with the stated goal of reducing 2017 \n\nparticulate pollution levels by 20 to 30 percent by the year 2024. In \n\n2022, the Government of India revamped its NCAP goal, aiming to \n\nachieve a 40 percent reduction in particulate pollution levels by \n\n2026 in 131 non-attainment cities. If India were to meet this target, \n\nthe residents in the non-attainment will see their life expectancy \n\nincrease by 2 years compared to 2017. India’ national average life \n\nexpectancy will also increase by an additional 7.8 months as a result. \n\nAs of 2022, pollution in the districts with non-attainment cities has \n\ndeclined by 18.8 percent relative to 2017, adding 10.8 months to the \n\nlife expectancy of 446.7 million residents of these districts, and 4 \n\nmonths to India’s national average life expectancy.          \n\n> 21 S & P Global. 2021. “Global energy demand to grow 47% by 2050, with oil\n> still top source: US EIA” https:/ /www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/\n> market-insights/latest-news/oil/100621-global-energy-demand-to-grow-47-by-\n> 2050-with-oil-still-top-source-us-eia\n> 22 U.S. Energy Information Administration. 2023. “International Energy Outlook\n> 2023” https:/ /www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/IEO2023_Narrative.pdf\n> 23 Enviliance Asia. 2022. “Bangladesh publishes Air Pollution Control Rules\n> including emission standards for mobile and stationary” https:/ /enviliance.com/\n> regions/south-asia/bd/report_7939\n> 24 Dhaka Tribune. 2019. “Environment minister: Brick kilns responsible for 58% air\n> pollution in Dhaka.”\n> 25 The Daily Star. 2019. “Checking Air Pollution: Bye bye brick!”\n> 26 Bangladesh Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. 2018. “Ambient\n> Air Quality in Bangladesh.” The 8 cities are as follows: Dhaka, Chittagong,\n> Narayanganj, Gazipur, Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Sylhet.

The population weighted-\n\naverage  PM 2.5  concentration in 2022 was nearly identical to the \n\naverage level in 2021, at 22.2  μg/m³ —4.4 times the WHO guideline. 31 \n\n31  Central Africa is defined as the following 11 countries: Angola, Burundi, \n\nCameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic \n\nRepublic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, São Tomé and Príncipe, \n\nRwanda.

An average resident of this \n\nregion can lose 1.7 years off their lives, translating to 1.9 billion \n\ntotal life years lost, if these levels of pollution persist. In Menoua, \n\nCameroon—the most polluted region—the life expectancy losses \n\nare as high as 5.1 years (Figure 3.1), comparable to the losses in the \n\nmost polluted regions in the world. \n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was the most polluted \n\n16  | 2024 Annual Update  AQLI country on the African continent in 2022, with an annual-average \n\nparticulate concentration of 34.7  μg/m³ , or nearly 6.9 times the \n\nWHO guideline. As a result, average life expectancy is 2.9 years \n\nlower than what it would be if the country met the WHO guideline. \n\nIn Kinshasa, the capital and largest city of the DRC with 12.3 million \n\npeople, residents are losing 3.3 years of life expectancy relative to \n\nif the city met the WHO guideline. Further, a cluster of regions to \n\nthe east of Kinshasa—namely, Mai-Ndombe, Kwilu, and Kasaï— \n\nexperience even higher levels of pollution, leading residents there \n\nto lose 3.7 to 3.9 years off their lives. In these regions, high air \n\npollution levels have been largely attributed to waste burning, \n\nmining, and industrial practices such as mineral processing and \n\ncement manufacturing. Moreover, with the prevalence of dirty \n\nindoor cookstoves, residents face additional exposure to high levels \n\nof air pollution indoors as well. 32 \n\nFollowing the DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, \n\nCameroon, and The Republic of the Congo were the most polluted \n\ncountries in Central and West Africa. These countries are also \n\namong the most polluted countries in the world. Their stories are \n\nsimilar.

In 2022, the particulate pollution level in Nigeria was 25  μg/  \n\n> 32 Interactive Country Fisches. “Democratic Republic of Congo: Pollution.”\n\nm³ —5 times the WHO guideline. As a result, residents of Nigeria \n\nare losing 2 years off their lives compared to if air quality met the \n\nWHO guideline. Cumulatively, Nigeria’s life years lost to pollution \n\nmake up more than 20 percent of the total life years lost in all of \n\nAfrica. In the Federal Capital Territory, home to Nigeria’s capital \n\ncity of Abuja and one of the most polluted regions in the country, \n\nresidents could gain 2.7 years of life expectancy if particulate \n\npollution were permanently reduced to meet the WHO guideline. \n\nIn Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city with 21.6 million people, residents \n\ncould see their life expectancy increase by 1.7 years if particulate \n\npollution were permanently reduced to meet the WHO guideline. \n\nFollowing the trend from previous years, Niger River Delta—where \n\noil refineries are linked to the grim daily reality of air pollution— \n\nfaces the highest health burden due to pollution in Nigeria. 33  With \n\nan average pollution of 31.3  μg/m³ , residents in these states are \n\nlosing 2.6 years of life expectancy, relative to the WHO guideline. \n\nThe health discourse in Sub-Saharan Africa has largely centered \n\naround infectious diseases, like HIV/AIDS and malaria, but \n\nthe data show that the health impacts of particulate pollution \n\nexposure are no less serious.

The \n\npopulation-weighted average particulate pollution in 2022 was \n\n12.9 percent higher than 2021, at 18.4 μg/m³––3.7 times the WHO \n\nguideline. The 466.5 million residents of this region stand to gain \n\n1.3 years in life expectancy, translating to 612.6 million total life \n\nyears saved, if the pollution level is reduced to meet the WHO \n\nguideline (Figure 4.1). In each of these countries, the impact of \n\n46  Middle East is defined as the following 13 countries: Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Israel, \n\nJordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, \n\nYemen. North Africa is defined as the following 6 countries: Algeria, Djibouti, \n\nEgypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia. \n\nparticulate pollution on life expectancy is comparable to other \n\nlarge health threats (Figure 4.2). The impact is significantly larger \n\nin Babil Governorate in Iraq, the region’s most polluted area, \n\nwhere particulate pollution is taking 4.1 years off of the life \n\nexpectancy of its residents. \n\nWith a particulate pollution level of 39.1 μg/m³, or nearly 7.8 \n\ntimes the WHO guideline, Qatar was not only the most polluted \n\ncountry in the Middle Eastern and North African region––it was \n\nalso the fourth most polluted country globally. The resulting \n\naverage life expectancy in Qatar is 3.3 years lower than what it \n\nwould be if the WHO guideline were met, making particulate \n\npollution a larger health threat here than smoking and vehicle \n\nAQLI  2024 Annual Update |  19 injuries (Figure 4.2). In Doha, the country’s capital and largest \n\ncity, home to about half its population, residents stand to lose \n\n3.4 years of life expectancy if the current pollution levels persist. \n\nParticulate pollution in Qatar has largely been attributed to \n\nindustrial emissions, and construction to support the rapid \n\nurbanization. 47 \n\nAlthough Qatar is the most polluted country, 39 out of the 50 \n\nmost polluted regions of the Middle East and North Africa lie in \n\nIraq. In 2022, the annual average particulate pollution levels in \n\nIraq were 32.4  μg/m³ , making it the second most polluted country \n\nof this region. Five of the country’s most polluted governorates \n\ncontribute more than 40 percent of the total life years lost \n\nin Iraq. 48  In Baghdad, Iraq’s capital and its most populous \n\ngovernorate, residents stand to lose 3.5 years of life expectancy \n\non average. The situation is even worse in the most polluted \n\ndistrict, Al Mahawil, in the neighboring Babil governorate, where \n\n1.3 million people are losing 4.1 years of life expectancy due to \n\nparticulate pollution. Air pollution in Iraq has been attributed to \n\nvehicle exhaust, electric generators, fires at oil and gas refineries, \n\nand continuous military conflict in the region. 49 \n\nDespite having lower average particulate pollution than Qatar \n\nand Iraq, Egypt faces the highest health burden in the region due \n\nto its large population. In 2022, the particulate pollution level \n\nin Egypt was 19.2  μg/m³ —almost 4 times the WHO guideline. \n\nThis means that an average resident of Egypt could live 1.4 years \n\nlonger if pollution levels in Egypt were brought down to meet \n\nthe WHO guideline. This would help prevent the loss of 149.7 \n\nmillion life years in the country. The city-governorate of Cairo, \n\nthe capital of Egypt and the largest megacity in the Middle East \n\nand North Africa with a population of 10.1 million, experiences \n\nPM 2.5  levels of 22.6  μg/m³ ––the worst in the country. With an \n\naverage resident in Cairo losing approximately 1.7 years of their \n\nlife, the combined life years lost due to particulate pollution \n\nin the Greater Cairo area are 23.6 million. 50  In Alexandria, the \n\nlargest city in the Mediterranean and an important tourism and \n\nindustrial hub of Egypt, the condition is slightly better with \n\n16.2  μg/m³  particulate pollution levels translating to 1.1 years of \n\nreduced life expectancy. Traffic congestion and vehicle exhaust, \n\nagriculture slash and burn practices, and coal fired power plants \n\nare major sources of particulate pollution in Egypt. 51 ,52           \n\n> 47 The Peninsula. 2024. “Signs of air quality improvement in Doha after major\n> construction boom” https:/ /thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/31/03/2024/\n> signs-of-air-quality-improvement-in-doha-after-major-construction-boom\n> 48 The five governorates are: Al Qadisiyah, An Najaf, Babil, Baghdad, Karbala\n> 49 Ecohubmap. 2023. “Air pollution in Baghdad, Iraq” https:/ /www.ecohubmap.\n> com/hot-spot/air-pollution-in-baghdad-iraq/nxoml7sorv56#\n> 50 Greater Cairo is defined as: Al Qahirah governorate, Imbabah, Giza,\n> Shubra-al-Khaymah\n> 51 Clean Air Fund. 2023. “From pollution to solution in Africa’s cities” https:/ /www.\n> cleanairfund.org/clean-air-africas-cities/cairo/\n> 52 IQAir. 2024. “Air quality in Egypt” https:/ /www.iqair.com/us/egypt\n\nUNEQUAL BURDEN OF PARTICULATE POLLUTION \n\nAt the regional level, particulate pollution remains highly \n\nunequal, with annual pollution levels ranging from as little as \n\n6.1  μg/m³  in Algeria to as high as 39.1  μg/m³  in Qatar. Overall, \n\nthe Middle Eastern countries have higher pollution than the \n\nNorth African countries. Reducing particulate pollution to meet \n\nthe WHO guideline would add 10 more months onto the lives \n\nof those living in the Middle East compared to those living \n\nin North Africa. Looking at a more granular level, particulate \n\npollution in the Middle Eastern and North African countries is \n\nalso concentrated in certain areas––mostly in the area around \n\nthe national capital of each country. \n\nSIGNS OF POLICY ACTION TO CURB AIR POLLUTION \n\nUntil recently, none of the 19 Middle Eastern and North African \n\ncountries had any air quality management plan. Seven out \n\nof these nineteen countries have  PM 2.5  standards. However, \n\nair quality is getting more attention as five countries have \n\nimplemented air quality management plans. \n\nIran first enacted the Law on Prevention of Air Pollution in \n\n1995. Since then, it has been updated twice. The latest update \n\nin 2017, called the Clean Air Law, includes stricter penalties for \n\nindustries or individuals that do not adhere to the pollution \n\nlimits. 53 , 54 \n\nThe Clean Air Law of Israel came into effect in 2012. Having \n\nundergone two revisions since then, it now includes clean \n\nair requirements for industrial facilities, measures to reduce \n\nvehicular pollution and greenhouse gasses, and renewable fuel \n\nstandards for biofuels. 55 \n\nThe Lebanese Parliament enacted the Law on the Protection of \n\nthe Environment. It comprises 34 articles related to air quality \n\nmonitoring and management, and prevention of air pollution. 56 ,57 \n\nIn 2021, Morocco, in partnership with the Climate and Clean \n\nAir Coalition, finalised its national action plan to reduce short-\n\nlived climate pollutants. Full implementation of the plan can \n\nreduce particulate matter from the transport sector in Morocco            \n\n> 53 FAO. 2024. “FAOLEX Database” https:/ /www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/\n> en/c/LEX-FAOC182168/\n> 54 Radio free Europe. 2023. “Iran's Environmental Standards, Polluted Reality Mix\n> Like Oil And Water” https:/ /www.rferl.org/a/iran-environmental-standards-pollu -\n> tion-smog/32385813.html#\n> 55 Library of congress. “Regulation of Air Pollution: Israel” https:/ /maint.loc.gov/\n> law/help/air-pollution/israel.php#_ftn14\n> 56 OHCHR. “Environment management in Lebanon” https:/ /www.ohchr.org/sites/\n> default/files/Documents/Issues/Environment/SREnvironment/Pollution/\n> Lebanon.pdf\n> 57 FAO. 2019.

Singapore and Timor-Leste were the only countries where \n\npollution levels increased compared to 2021. Across the region, air \n\npollution reduces average life expectancy by 1.2 years, relative to \n\nwhat it would be if the WHO guideline of 5  μg/m³  was permanently \n\nmet (Figure 5.1). In the 11 countries that make up this region, an \n\nestimated 1 billion total life years are lost due to air pollution. 61 \n\nWhile average pollution decreased slightly in 2022, pollution \n\nlevels in Southeast Asia have remained largely unchanged for \n\ntwo decades, generally fluctuating between 17 and 22  μg/m³ —\n\nalmost 3.5 times the WHO guideline. Virtually all, 99.9 percent, \n\nof Southeast Asia’s roughly 681.3 million people breathe air that \n\nWHO deems polluted. Simeulue and Kepulauan Mentawai in \n\nIndonesia, and Turtle Islands and Kalibato Lake in Philippines \n\nare the only regions where air quality meets the WHO guideline. \n\nIn 2022, the population-weighted particulate concentration in \n\nMyanmar, the most polluted Southeast Asian country, was 28.6 \n\nμg/m³ —5 times the WHO guideline. Because pollution surpasses \n\nthe WHO guideline, residents of Myanmar are losing 2.9 years \n\nof life expectancy. This is significantly more than other health \n\nthreats in Myanmar such as child and maternal malnutrition \n\n(1.4 years) or respiratory infections and tuberculosis (1.4 years) \n\n(Figure 5.2). In Yangon and Mandalay, the most populated regions \n\n61  Southeast Asia includes the following countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, \n\nLaos, Malaysia, Myanmar, The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, \n\nVietnam \n\nin Myanmar, average pollution levels were 27.8 and 33.8  μg/m³ \n\nin 2022, respectively. If the WHO guideline were met in Yangon \n\nand Mandalay, residents would gain 2.2 and 2.8 years, respectively. \n\nWhile Indonesia’s pollution has remained largely consistent over \n\nthe past decade— fluctuating between 18 and 22  μg/m³ —during \n\ndry seasons, fires in Indonesia cause sudden spikes in pollution for \n\nthe country and its downwind neighbors like Malaysia. The impact \n\nof fewer fires in the region in 2022 compared to the most recent \n\nactive wildfire season in 2019, a year characterized by thousands of \n\nfires on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo, bears out \n\nin the data. 62  Indonesia saw a 17.2 percent decrease in particulate \n\npollution in 2022 compared to 2019, while Malaysia experienced \n\na 33.9 percent decrease. \n\nIn the Indonesian island of Java, the country’s population \n\nand industrial center, pollution levels dipped slightly in 2022 \n\ncompared to 2019. In the region surrounding the megacity of \n\nJakarta (including Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, and Tangerang), the \n\naverage annual  PM 2.5  concentration fell roughly 6.3 percent in \n\n2022 to 28.2  μg/m³ . Still, if the region met the WHO guideline, \n\nthe roughly 24.9 million residents would gain an average of 2.2 \n\nyears in life expectancy. In 2022, North Sumatra––among the most \n\npolluted regions in Indonesia––also saw a decrease relative to \n\n2019. Medan, for example, experienced pollution levels of 33.0 \n\nμg/m³ ––significantly down from 2019 levels of 40.2  μg/m³ . Here, \n\nresidents stand to gain 2.7 years of life expectancy if pollution \n\nwere to be reined in to meet the WHO guideline. \n\n62  Mongabay. 2024. “2023 fires increase fivefold in \n\nIndonesia amid El Niño”  https:/ /news.mongabay. \n\ncom/2024/01/2023-fires-increase-fivefold-in-indonesia-amid-el-nino/ \n\nSection 5 \n\n# Air Pollution remains a Major \n\n# Burden in Southeast Asia \n\n## Like South Asia, most parts of Southeast Asia experienced a decline in \n\n## pollution in 2022 compared to 2021. Despite the reduction, the average \n\n## pollution levels in Southeast Asia were 3.6 times higher than the WHO \n\n## guideline. With sustained exposure to such pollution levels, an average \n\n## Southeast Asian resident is likely to lose 1.2 years off their life relative to \n\n## what it would be if the WHO guideline were met.   \n\n> 22 | 2024 Annual Update AQLI\n\nIn Thailand, particulate pollution decreased 5.3 percent from 2021. \n\nThe national average was 21.2  μg/m³  in 2022, a level that has been \n\nroughly constant since the mid-2000s. But overall, particulate \n\npollution concentrations varied widely in 2022, ranging from \n\n31.1  μg/m³  in Phayao in the North, to 19.1  μg/m³  in the metropolis \n\nof Bangkok, to 11.6  μg/m³  in Phuket in the South. This variation \n\nis partly due to fires in Thailand’s northern region (including \n\nthe regions surrounding Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Saraburi, and \n\nPhayao, for instance) that have increased the amount of regional \n\nair pollution, reducing life expectancy by up to 2.8 years relative \n\nto life expectancy under the WHO guideline. Meanwhile, in \n\nThailand’s largest urban area, Bangkok, residents would gain 1.4 \n\nyears if pollution levels met the WHO guideline. \n\nIn Vietnam, there are even sharper differences between regions. \n\nIn the capital city of Hanoi, home to more than 8 million people \n\nand one of Vietnam’s major industrial centers, life expectancy \n\nwould increase by 3 years if air quality met the WHO guideline. \n\nThe impacts of air pollution are much lower in many of Vietnam’s \n\nsouthern regions, where coastal provinces such as Phu Yen would \n\nsee 0.9 years of added life expectancy if air quality met the WHO \n\nguideline. Overall, the average Vietnamese citizen stands to gain \n\n2 years in life expectancy, if pollution was permanently reduced to \n\nthe WHO guideline. This threat to life expectancy is significantly \n\nlarger than other health threats in Vietnam such as diabetes (1.1 \n\nyears) or respiratory infections and tuberculosis (0.84 years) \n\n(Figure 5.2.). \n\nFigure 5.1 ·  Potential gain in life expectancy from permanently reducing PM 2.5  from 2022 concentration to the WHO guideline \n\nFigure 5.2 ·  Comparison of selected major global threats to life expectancy in Southeast Asian countries    \n\n> Sources: Global Burden of Disease ( https:/ /vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/ ) level-2 causes and risks data and WHO Life Tables ( https:/ /apps.who.int/gho/data/\n> node.main.LIFECOUNTRY?lang=en ) were combined with the Life table method to arrive at these results. “PM 2.5 relative to WHO Guideline” bar displays the reduction\n> in life expectancy relative to the WHO guideline as calculated by latest AQLI (2022) data.\n> 2.0 1.0 0.5 5.0 ≥6.0 4.0 3.0 00.1 Potential gain in life expectancy (in years)\n> AQLI 2024 Annual Update | 23\n\nHOW CAN COUNTRIES IN THIS REGION TACKLE AIR POLLUTION? \n\nThe countries in this region must work together to reduce \n\nbiomass, farm, forest and peatland fires. In 2023, at the 18th \n\nMeeting of the Committee Under the Conference of the Parties \n\nto ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (COM-\n\n18) in Laos 63 , the second Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation \n\ntowards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control with Means of \n\nImplementation (Haze-Free Roadmap) (2023-2030) was adopted. \n\nThe roadmap works on implementation of actions across ASEAN \n\nmember states to prevent and control land fires. The roadmap \n\nalso stressed the need for satellites and applications to use for \n\nfire and haze monitoring, as well as the Malaysian Meteorological \n\nDepartment’s refinement of the Southeast Asia Fire Danger \n\nRating System to increase the number of weather stations, \n\nimplementation of a new fire danger code for northern the ASEAN \n\nregion, and the simulation of the 7-day forecast. \n\nAlongside reducing biomass, forest and peatland fires—tighter fuel \n\nemissions standards offer another area of potential improvement. \n\nIn contrast to China and India, where fuel standards are at least \n\nas stringent as those adopted by the European Union (Euro-6), the \n\nfuel standards are much lower in Indonesia and Thailand. Vehicles \n\nare only required to meet Euro-4 standards, which allow for up \n\nto 3 times more diesel NO x emissions, and 5 times more sulfur \n\ncontent. The Thai government, which had plans to adopt the Euro-\n\n5 standards in 2021, had delayed the adoption of the standards to \n\n2024 due to COVID-19 restrictions and their subsequent impact \n\non the private sector’s readiness to practically implement those \n\nstandards. 64  On January 1, 2024, Thailand officially adopted the \n\nEuro-5 standard for diesel vehicles. 65  The standard was adopted \n\nafter the Thai Industrial Standards Institute accepted applications \n\nfrom February to December 2023 and recorded 50 applications \n\nfrom 25 automobile manufacturers.

The state’s pollution \n\nregulating authority, Gujarat Pollution Control Board, is carrying \n\nout the emissions trading program with the help of a team of \n\nresearchers from the Energy Policy Institute at the University \n\nof Chicago (EPIC), Economic Growth Center at Yale University, \n\nand The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL). Through \n\nthe Emission Trading Programme, the government sets a cap on \n\nemissions and allows industries to buy and sell below the cap. \n\nThe researchers are evaluating the program’s benefits and costs, \n\nrelative to the status quo, using a randomized controlled trial, and \n\nhave found that this approach has proven to be successful with \n\npollution decreasing by 20-30 percent and industry abatement \n\ncosts declining by 11% at a constant level of emissions. 1\n\nAnother randomized evaluation from the same state of Gujarat \n\nfinds that strengthening third-party audits of industrial emission \n\nreports can reduce pollution. One way environmental regulators \n\nmonitor compliance with industrial emission standards is through \n\nthird party auditors. In most instances, auditors are compensated \n\nby and accountable to the company they audit, leading to a \n\npotential conflict of interest. This arrangement might incentivize \n\nauditors to manipulate or falsify their reports. And, if auditors fail \n\nto report accurately, the regulated parties have no motivation \n\nto comply with regulations, as the regulators lack the necessary \n\ninformation to enforce penalties. To address this problem, Gujarat \n\nPollution Control Board (GPCB) collaborated with the same \n\ngroup of researchers as above to help reform the audit market by \n\nimproving accuracy of audit reports, thereby, improving industrial \n\ncompliance. GPCB and the researchers created a reformed \n\naudit system in which auditors were randomly assigned to the \n\nindustrial plants they would monitor, paid from a common pool, \n\nand monitored for accuracy. The researchers found that with the \n\nauditors working in treatment plants (reformed audit system) \n\nwere 80 percent less likely to falsely report emission readings \n\nand average pollution from industrial units in the treatment group \n\ndropped with highest reduction concentrated in plants that \n\nreported highest readings. 2 \n\n> 1\n\nGreenstone, M., Pande, R., Sudarshan, A., & Ryan,  N.

The situation is much worse in the most polluted region \n\nin Bolivia and all of Latin America—the city of Marban in the \n\nDepartment of Beni. There, the average particulate pollution level \n\nwas 45.7  μg/m³  in 2022—or 9.1 times the WHO guideline. If the \n\nregion cleaned up its air to permanently meet the WHO guideline, \n\nresidents could see their life expectancy increase by 4 years. \n\nRural residents in Bolivia also face high levels of particulate \n\npollution. For example, in Mamoré (Department of Beni)—a rural \n\nregion containing some of the country’s worst air quality—the \n\naverage level of particulate pollution in 2022 was 41.8  μg/m³ .\n\nResidents there are losing 3.6 years of life expectancy due to this \n\nunclean air, relative to if the WHO guideline was met. \n\nIn Guatemala, which is one of the countries in the Central American \n\nVolcanic arc, particulate pollution is one of the greatest threats to \n\nhuman health. The average life expectancy in Guatemala is 2.1 \n\nyears lower than what it would be if the WHO guideline were \n\nmet—making particulate pollution a larger health threat than \n\ninterpersonal violence, tuberculosis and tobacco use (Figure 6.3). \n\nMixco, Guatemala, is the country’s most polluted city, where \n\nresidents are losing 3.8 years off their lives. Latin America’s air \n\npollution is not only limited to its cities. In Brazil, Latin America’s \n\nmost populous country, 216.9 million people could gain 8.4 months \n\nof life expectancy—or a total of 151.8 million life years gained—if \n\nparticulate pollution were reduced to meet the WHO guideline. \n\nThe situation is significantly worse in the Rondônia state—one \n\nof the Amazonian states of Brazil where 1.7 million residents are \n\nlosing 3.2 years of life expectancy to polluted air. In the state of \n\nAmazonas, particulate pollution levels are 6.4 times the WHO \n\nguideline, primarily due to the burning of the rainforests. The fires \n\nare a result of deforestation and illegal fires set to clear land for \n\nfarming and cattle grazing. 75  The 4.1 million residents of the area \n\ncould gain 2.7 years of life expectancy if pollution was reduced to \n\npermanently meet the WHO guideline. \n\nPROGRESS TOWARDS REDUCING AIR POLLUTION \n\nVehicle emissions are primarily responsible for poor air quality in \n\nLatin America’s major hotspot cities in Guatemala, Bolivia, and \n\nPeru among others. 76  In recent decades, several Latin American    \n\n> 75 Rainforest Foundation US. 2024. “Amazon Rainforest Fires” https:/ /rainforest -\n> foundation.org/engage/brazil-amazon-fires/\n> 76 Guatemala: International Women’s Media Foundation. 2018. “How Outdated\n> Cars Live On in a Smoggy Afterlife.”; Bolivia: Mardoñez, V., Uzu, G., Andrade, M.,\n> Borlaza, L.

But, \n\nthanks to stringent policy action, China has managed to reduce \n\nits air pollution by 41 percent between 2013 and 2022. Within \n\nthe country, Beijing province experienced the largest decline in \n\npollution, dropping 54.1 percent in just nine years (Figure 7.1). \n\nBecause of these air quality improvements, the average Chinese \n\ncitizen can expect to live 2 years longer, provided the reductions \n\nare sustained. In Beijing, the average person can expect to live 3.9 \n\nyears longer. In Shanghai, where  PM 2.5  fell from 45.3 to 23.0  μg/m³ ,\n\nthe average person could expect to live 2.2 years longer (Figure 7.2). \n\nChina has had such success in reducing pollution because of strict \n\npublic policies. After China reached its highest pollution levels in \n\n2013, the public began to call for change. China responded with \n\na National Air Quality Action Plan in the fall of 2013, laying out \n\nspecific targets to improve air quality by the end of 2017, including a \n\nUSD 270 billion initiative to reduce pollution in densely populated \n\nregions. \n\nTo meet the goals laid out in its National Air Quality Action Plan, \n\nthe government began to restrict the number of cars on the road \n\nin large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In the \n\nindustrial sector, iron and steel making capacity was reduced. \n\nNew coal plants were banned in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), \n\nPearl River Delta (PRD) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) regions. \n\nExisting plants were mandated to reduce their emissions or switch \n\nto natural gas and renewable energy sources, while others were \n\nclosed or relocated. In addition, coal-fired boilers used for heating \n\nhomes in the north were replaced with gas or electric heaters. \n\nThanks to these and other strict pollution policies, China’s annual \n\nFigure 7.1 ·  Annual average PM 2.5  concentrations in major regions in Mainland China, 1998-2022 \n\nNote: PRD stands for Pearl River Delta, and it includes the dense network of cities that covers nine prefectures of the province of Guangdong, namely Dongguan, \n\nFoshan, Guangzhou, Huizhou, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, Zhaoqing, Zhongshan and Zhuhai and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. YRD stands \n\nfor Yangtze River Delta, and it includes Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. BTH stands for Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. It is important to note that our definition of the YRD \n\nregion includes all regions in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Others may define the YRD region differently than how we have defined it in this report. \n\nAQLI  2024 Annual Update |  29 average pollution level now meets the national standard of 35  μg/ \n\nm³ . However, the pollution in China is still 5.6 times higher than \n\nthe WHO guideline and remains one of the top threats to life \n\nexpectancy in the country. If China were able to reduce its pollution \n\nfrom 2022 level to meet the WHO guideline, and those reductions \n\nwere permanently sustained, the average person in China would \n\nsee their life expectancy increase further by 2.3 years. This threat \n\nfalls just behind the threat from tobacco and high blood pressure \n\nin the country, which takes 3 years of life expectancy (Figure 7.3). \n\nUNEQUAL BURDEN OF AIR POLLUTION \n\nWhile the overall pollution level in the country has declined since \n\n2013, residents in the more heavily polluted provinces of Hebei, \n\nTianjin, Henan, and Shandong stand to gain between 3 and 3.4 \n\nadditional years of life expectancy if pollution levels in these \n\nregions were brought down to meet the WHO guidelines. The \n\nhealth threat is even larger in the 54 prefectures that do not meet \n\nChina’s national standard of 35  μg/m³ . With an annual average \n\nparticulate pollution of 40.5  μg/m³ , 318.1 million residents in these \n\n54 prefectures would live 3.5 years longer if the WHO guideline \n\nwas permanently met. Additionally, 33 out of these 54 prefectures \n\nexperienced an increase in particulate pollution in 2022 compared \n\nto 2021. \n\nAcross the entire country, 112 prefectures reported an increase in \n\nparticulate pollution from 2021 to 2022. Out of these, 24 prefectures \n\nin northern and western China reported an increase compared \n\nto 2013. In other words, these prefectures are more polluted now \n\nthan they were when China began its war on pollution. Reducing \n\npollution to meet the WHO guideline can add 1.5 years to the \n\nlife expectancy of 29.7 million residents in these prefectures. \n\nThese prefectures are distributed across the provinces of Gansu, \n\nHeilongjiang, Nei Mongol, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Xinjiang Uygur. \n\nAmong these provinces, Hebei, Xinjiang Uygur, and Sichuan also \n\nface the most unequal burden of air pollution, with the potential \n\ngain in life expectancy in China ranging between 2.4 months to 4.4 \n\nyears across them (outlined in black in Figure 7.2). \n\nWhile China has made significant improvements in reducing \n\nits pollution, there is more to be done. In November 2023, China \n\npublished its third pollution control plan. 80  The plan sets a \n\n2025 target of reducing particulate pollution in all cities at the \n\nprefecture level and above by 10 percent compared to 2020. It \n\ntargets a 20 percent reduction in the  PM 2.5  level of the BTH region \n\nand a 15 percent reduction in the pollution level of the Fenwei \n\nPlain compared to its 2020 level. If the pollution reductions are \n\nsuccessful, they will add 10 months to the average life expectancy \n\nin the BTH region and 6.9 months in the Fenwei Plain. 81  Time will \n\ntell how China responds to these new targets in the coming years. .     \n\n> 80 Dialogue earth. 2023. “New air pollution control plan released” https:/ /dialogue.\n> earth/en/digest/new-air-pollution-control-plan-released/\n> 81 Fenwei Plain is defined as the following prefectures: Xi’an, Baoji, Xianyang,\n> Weinan, Tongchuan in Shaanxi province; Jinzhong, Luliang, Linfen, Yuncheng in\n> Shanxi province; Luoyang, Sanmenxia in Henan province.

At this \n\nlevel, residents could expect to gain roughly 2.2 months if the air \n\nthey breathed permanently met the WHO guideline, or 62.6 million \n\ntotal life years. \n\nThe average European resident in 2022 was exposed to a particulate \n\npollution concentration of 11.1  μg/m³ , meeting the European Union’s \n\nannual  PM 2.5  limit of 25  μg/m³  and the stage 2 limit of 20  μg/m³ ,\n\nbut falling short of the revised WHO guideline as well as the newly \n\nadopted EU 2030 limit of 10  μg/m³ .85 ,86  If particulate pollution were \n\nto meet the revised WHO guideline, average life expectancy across \n\nEurope would improve by 7.2 months, or 515.9 million total life years. \n\nUNEQUAL BURDEN OF AIR POLLUTION \n\nSpecific areas of the United States and Europe face much higher \n\nlevels of pollution than the average, having a significant impact \n\non life expectancy. \n\n85  Although the EU PM 2.5  standard only applies to a subset of the countries in \n\nEurope that are in the EU, we use it as a reference point for all of Europe’s 53 \n\ncountries, in this report. \n\n86  Council of the Europen Union. 2024. “Air quality: Council and Parliament strike \n\ndeal to strengthen standards in the EU”  https:/ /www.consilium.europa.eu/en/ \n\npress/press-releases/2024/02/20/air-quality-council-and-parliament-strike-\n\ndeal-to-strengthen-standards-in-the-eu/ \n\nAQLI  2024 Annual Update |  31 In recent years, rising wildfires in the Western United States \n\nhave caused air pollution levels to rise in the region. Residents \n\nof California’s Central Valley are now exposed to average \n\nparticulate pollution levels above both the WHO guideline and \n\nthe nation’s own air quality standard. In 2022, while Fairbanks \n\nNorth Star Borough in Alaska was the most polluted county-\n\nequivalent where residents stand to gain 10 months if WHO \n\nguideline was met, nine out of ten most polluted counties were \n\nin California. There, average pollution concentrations ranged \n\nfrom 4.3  μg/m³  in Del Norte County to 11.6  μg/m³  in Kern County. \n\n(Figure 8.3). \n\nLike the United States, the burden of air pollution is unequal \n\nin Europe as well, with the eastern portions of the continent \n\nreporting higher pollution levels (Figure 8.4). If both Eastern \n\nand Western Europe were to meet the WHO guideline, Eastern \n\nEurope would gain 4.8 months more on to their life expectancy \n\ncompared to Western Europe. 87  The East European nation of \n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is the most polluted country in Europe, \n\nand virtually all of Poland, Belarus, Slovakia, Hungary, Lithuania, \n\nand Armenia exceed the WHO guideline. If particulate pollution \n\nwas reduced to meet the WHO guideline, an average resident \n\nof these countries would gain an additional 10.2 months of \n\nlife expectancy—equivalent to the addition of 61.3 million \n\nlife years. The cities of Tuzla and Zenica-Doboj in Bosnia and \n\nHerzegovina and their surrounding areas see particularly \n\n87  The definition of Eastern v/s Western Europe can be found  here .

In Milan, the city with the highest pollution \n\nin Western Europe, residents would gain 1.7 years if particulate \n\npollution levels were reduced to meet the WHO guideline. \n\nACTION TOWARDS STRENGTHENING AIR QUALITY STANDARDS \n\nIn the wake of the revised WHO guideline in 2021, both the \n\nUnited States and European Union have been taking steps to \n\nstrengthen their  PM 2.5  standards. As of May 6, 2024, the United \n\nStates Environmental Protection Agency implemented a new \n\nannual  PM 2.5  standard of 9  μg/m³ , replacing its standard of 12  μg/ \n\nm³ .88  In 2022, all states in the US met the old standard. Despite \n\nthe more stringent standard, the pollution levels in only 13 out of \n\nthe 3,142 counties in the United States were higher than the new \n\nstandard. Nine of these counties are in the state of California. If \n\nthese counties were to meet the revised standards, an average \n\nresident in these parts of the US would gain an additional 1.3 \n\nmonths of life expectancy, adding 1.9 million life years nationally. \n\nMeanwhile, in late 2022, the European Commission proposed \n\nratcheting down the European Union’s current  PM 2.5  standard of \n\n25  μg/m³  to 10  μg/m³  by 2030. 89  In February 2024 the European \n\nparliament struck a provisional agreement with EU countries in \n\nthis regard. 90  As per the latest AQLI data, 12 of the 27 member      \n\n> 88 USEPA. 2024. “Final Rule to Strengthen the National Air Quality Health Standard\n> for Particulate Matter” https:/ /www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-02/\n> pm-naaqs-overview.pdf\n> 89 European Commission. 2022. “DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\n> AND OF THE COUNCIL on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (recast).”\n> 90 European parliament news. 2024. “Air pollution: Deal\n> with Council to improve air quality” https:/ /www.europarl.\n> europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240219IPR17816/\n> air-pollution-deal-with-council-to-improve-air-quality\n\ncountries of the EU exceed the 2030 stricter limit.

In the most \n\npolluted regions, individuals are losing more than 5 years of life \n\nexpectancy. \n\nThe impacts of air pollution are highly unequal, with South Asia \n\nand Sub-Saharan Africa bearing the brunt. Significant disparities \n\nalso exist within regions. For instance, while China has reduced \n\nits particulate pollution levels by over 40 percent since 2013, \n\nmore than 20 percent of China's population still breathes air \n\nthat does not meet the country’s standard. \n\nNational standards are an important tool to improve air \n\nquality. If countries adopt more ambitious air quality targets \n\nand implement policies to achieve these targets, life expectancy \n\nwould significantly improve. Yet, more than 30 percent of the \n\nworld’s population lives in regions that don’t meet their country’s \n\nnational standard. But if those countries did meet their own \n\nbenchmarks, it would add more than 3 billion life-years globally. \n\nFurther, almost half of all countries around the world don’t have \n\na pollution standard at all, and many of them are among the \n\nmost polluted countries in the world. The latest AQLI report \n\nemphasizes the disparity of air pollution around the world, the \n\nimpacts on human health, and the policies helping to reverse \n\nthese disparities.   \n\n> 34 | 2024 Annual Update AQLI\n\n# Appendix I: Methodology \n\nThe life expectancy calculations made by the AQLI are based on a \n\npair of peer-reviewed studies, Chen et al. (2013) and Ebenstein et \n\nal. (2017), co-authored by Michael Greenstone, that exploit a unique \n\nnatural experiment in China. By comparing two subgroups of the \n\npopulation that experienced prolonged exposure to different levels \n\nof particulate air pollution, the studies were able to plausibly isolate \n\nthe effect of particulate air pollution from other factors that affect \n\nhealth. Although the study was based solely on a Chinese setting, \n\ntogether, the regions and years covered in the study saw a wide range \n\nof pollution levels - spanning 27-307 μg/m³ of PM10 (approximately \n\nequivalent to 18-200  μg/m³  of  PM 2.5 ). Thus, the relationship between \n\nlife expectancy and particulate pollution that underlies the AQLI \n\nis derived from a  PM 2.5  distribution similar to the observed global \n\ndistribution, providing a credible basis for generalizing the measured \n\npollution-life expectancy relationship from Ebenstein et al. (2017). \n\nWe’d like to note that the global PM 2.5  annual average measurements \n\nin this AQLI update range from less than 1  μg/m³  to 84  μg/m³ . For life \n\nexpectancy estimates for regions with particulate concentrations \n\nlower than those in Ebenstein et al. (2017) - home to approximately \n\n40 percent of the world population, the AQLI assumes the same \n\nlinear relationship between long-term exposure to  PM 2.5  and life \n\nexpectancy, as the rest of the concentration range. Though it is \n\npossible that the pollution-life expectancy relationship is nonlinear \n\nover certain ranges of  PM 2.5  concentrations and/or that there is a \n\nthreshold below which  PM 2.5  has no effect, we are unaware of \n\ncredible empirical evidence that would cause a rejection of the \n\nlinearity assumption. \n\nEbenstein et al. (2017) found that sustained exposure to an additional \n\n10  μg/m³  of PM 10  reduces life expectancy by 0.64 years. In terms of \n\nPM 2.5 , this translates to the relationship that an additional 10  μg/ \n\nm³  of  PM 2.5  reduces life expectancy by 0.98 years. This metric is then \n\ncombined with sea-salt and mineral dust removed satellite-derived \n\nPM 2.5  data. All 2022 annual average  PM 2.5  values are population-\n\nweighted and AQLI’s source of population data is  https://landscan. \n\nornl.gov/ . We are grateful to the Atmospheric Composition Analysis \n\nGroup, based at the Washington University in St. Louis for providing \n\nus with the satellite data.

Evolution of Satellite-Derived PM 2.5  Data \n\nReliable, geographically extensive pollution measurements are \n\ncritical to understanding the extent of air pollution and its health \n\nimpacts. Unfortunately, many areas around the world either lack \n\nextensive pollution monitoring systems or did not begin monitoring \n\nPM 2.5  until recently, making it impossible to track long-term global \n\ntrends. To construct a single dataset of particulate pollution and \n\nits health impacts that is global in coverage, local in resolution, \n\nconsistent in methodology, and that spans many years to reveal \n\npollution trends over time, the latest AQLI data incorporates \n\nsatellite-derived annual ambient  PM 2.5  concentration estimates \n\nspanning 25 years from 1998-2022 by the Atmospheric Composition \n\nAnalysis Group at the University of Washington (methodology \n\ndescribed in van Donkelaar et al. (2021) and Donkelaar et al. (2024). \n\nThe latest raw dataset (version: V6.GL.01) is publicly accessible at: \n\nhttps://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/#V6.GL.02 .\n\nThe AQLI uses a version of this data that excludes sea salt and dust. \n\nThere are differences between the satellite-derived PM2.5 dataset \n\nused in this report and those used in previous AQLI reports. For \n\nexample, in the new and revised 2022 dataset used this year, the \n\nestimated global population-weighted average  PM 2.5  concentration \n\nfor the year 2019 has been revised downwards (from 28.5  μg/m³  to \n\n27.2  μg/m³ ) relative to the 2021 dataset used in our 2023 AQLI update \n\n(Figure A.1) \n\nAccording to van Donkelaar et al. (2021), satellite-derived  PM 2.5  data \n\nwere constructed by converting measurements of aerosol optical \n\ndepth (AOD) over each grid cell into  PM 2.5  measurements using a \n\nchemical transport model called GEOS-Chem. These estimates were \n\nthen subsequently calibrated to regional ground-based observations \n\nof both total and compositional mass using a Geographically \n\nWeighted Regression (GWR). Over time, improvements in the model \n\nand calibration inputs, alongside growing ground level monitoring \n\ncoverage necessitate periodic updates to the historical  PM 2.5  dataset. \n\nIn Figure A.1, we plot and compare the global population-weighted \n\nPM 2.5 -time trends using various years’ versions of the annual average \n\nPM 2.5  dataset. Although the new and revised  PM 2.5  dataset yields \n\nglobal average concentration levels that are lower on average than \n\nthose estimated using the 2020 and 2021 datasets and higher on \n\naverage than the 2016 reference datasets, the overall picture remains \n\nthe same. The global annual average  PM 2.5  level has shifted between \n\n3.8 to 7.2 times the WHO guideline, making air pollution the greatest \n\nexternal threat to human health globally. \n\nFigure A.1 ·  Comparing latest (2022 reference dataset) global annual average PM 2.5  concentration time series with various historical \n\nreference datasets \n\nNote: The “2022 dataset” line plots the global population-weighted annual average PM 2.5  trend using data accessible from  https:/ /sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/ \n\nsurface-pm2-5/#V6.GL.02  and methodology described in van Donkelaar et al. (2021) and Donkelaar et al. (2024). The “2021 dataset” line plots the global population-\n\nweighted average PM2.5 trend using data from van Donkelaar et al. (2021). The “2020 dataset” line plots the analogous trend using data from Hammer et al. (2020). \n\nThe “2016 dataset” plots the trend using data from van Donkelaar et al. (2016). Note that the AQLI uses a version of all datasets that excludes sea salt and dust.

Greenstone’s research, which has influenced policy globally, \n\nis largely focused on uncovering the benefits and costs of environmental quality and \n\nsociety’s energy choices. As the Chief Economist for President Obama’s Council of \n\nEconomic Advisers, he co-led the development of the United States Government’s social \n\ncost of carbon. Additionally, he has been researching the impacts of particulate pollution \n\non human well-being for more than two decades, including work that plausibly quantified \n\nthe causal relationship between long-term human exposure to particulate pollution and \n\nlife expectancy. This work is the basis of the Air Quality Life Index. \n\nTanushree Ganguly \n\nTanushree Ganguly is the Director of Air Quality Life Index programme at EPIC. Her career \n\nefforts focus on strengthening data-driven air quality decision making, and unpacking \n\nchallenges in implementing national-level policies at local levels. She has worked as air \n\nquality consultant and researcher in the US and India. Prior to joining AQLI, Tanushree led \n\nthe Clean Air Programme at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, and supported \n\nmultiple states and municipalities in charting pathways towards meeting their clean air \n\nambitions.

He has a master’s in environmental engineering \n\nfrom National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK).   \n\n> AQLI 2024 Annual Update | 45\n\nABOUT THE AIR QUALITY LIFE INDEX \n\nThe AQLI is a pollution index that translates particulate air pollution into perhaps the most important \n\nmetric that exists: its impact on life expectancy. Developed by the University of Chicago’s Milton Friedman \n\nDistinguished Service Professor in Economics Michael Greenstone and his team at the Energy Policy Institute \n\nat the University of Chicago (EPIC), the AQLI is rooted in recent research that quantifies the causal relationship \n\nbetween long-term human exposure to air pollution and life expectancy. The Index then combines this \n\nresearch with hyper-localized, global particulate measurements, yielding unprecedented insight into the true \n\ncost of particulate pollution in communities around the world. The Index also illustrates how air pollution \n\npolicies can increase life expectancy when they meet the World Health Organization’s guideline for what \n\nis considered a safe level of exposure, existing national air quality standards, or user-defined air quality \n\nlevels. This information can help to inform local communities and policymakers about the importance of \n\nair pollution policies in concrete terms. \n\nABOUT EPIC \n\nThe Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) is confronting the global energy challenge \n\nby working to ensure that energy markets provide access to reliable, affordable energy, while limiting \n\nenvironmental and social damages. We do this using a unique interdisciplinary approach that translates \n\nrobust, data-driven research into real-world impacts through strategic outreach and training for the next \n\ngeneration of global energy leaders. \n\nThe EPIC Clean Air Program is working to bring actionable information about the quality of the air we breathe \n\nand its impact on our health to every corner of the globe in order to motivate action and lay guideposts \n\nfor efficient air pollution policies. This work includes an  Air Quality Fund  to bring high quality and high \n\nfrequency air pollution monitoring and data access to the places of the world where it is needed most; the Air \n\nQuality Life Index (AQLI), which uses air pollution data to translate the impact of pollution on a person’s life \n\nexpectancy; and several particulate pollution trading markets being piloted in Indian cities in coordination \n\nwith state governments. \n\n/UChicagoEnergy epic.uchicago.edu  @UChiEnergy  /UChicagoEnergy  @UChiEnergy \n\naqli.epic.uchicago.edu  aqli-info@uchicago.edu  @UChiAir #AQLI\n",

Community Survey (ACS)\n===============================\n\nThe[American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html)(ACS) is the premier source of detailed information about the nation's people and housing. As an ongoing survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau since 2005, the ACS collects detailed social, economic, housing, and demographic information from a sample of households across the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe ACS provides up-to-date information annually, which helps local officials, community leaders, and businesses make informed decisions.\n\nCovering more than 40 topics—including education, employment, income, housing, and transportation—the ACS provides crucial insights into the changing needs and conditions of communities. Its data are used for countless reasons, such as to plan roads, schools, and emergency services, and to guide the distribution of government funding.\n\nFeatured\n--------\n\n*   \n* * *\n\n[Respond to the ACS Learn the different ways to respond to the American Community Survey -- online, by phone, by email.
