They will use their years of expertise and knowledge to prove fault and negotiate a fair settlement for your injuries, [pain and suffering](https://1800lionlaw.com/pain-and-suffering/), and other damages.\n\n**What is the [statute of limitations in Texas](https://1800lionlaw.com/statute-of-limitations/) for personal injury claims?**\n\nIn Texas, personal injury victims have two years to file a lawsuit.

PennDOT has recently received reports of scammers trying to impersonate PennDOT or the Department of Motor Vehicles to obtain personal information, such as bank account information. PennDOT does not send texts about traffic violations or fines.\n\nPennDOT is Working for You\n--------------------------\n\nAt PennDOT, we oversee programs and policies affecting highways, urban and rural public transportation, airports, railroads, ports, and waterways.More than three-quarters of PennDOT's annual budget is invested in Pennsylvania's approximately 122,000 miles of state and local highways and 32,000 state and local bridges. We are directly responsible for nearly 40,000 miles of highway and roughly 25,400 bridges, a system first established in 1911. We also administer the state's 11.8 million vehicle registrations and 10.2 million driver's licenses and IDs, and oversee safety and emission inspection programs.\n\nWhether it's at a maintenance garage or a driver's license center, PennDOT's nearly 12,000 employees are focused on making improvements, enhancing equity in our transportation systems for all people, and striving for a safer, more connected Pennsylvania.\n\n[Report a State Road Concern(opens in a new tab)](https://customercare.penndot.pa.gov/eCCC/eCCC.nsf)\n\n[PennDOT Services(opens in a new tab)](https://pa.gov/en/services.html#f-copapwpagency=Department%20of%20Transportation,Driver%20and%20Vehicle%20Services)\n\n[Forms & Publications(opens in a new tab)](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/penndot/forms-and-publications.html)\n\n[Projects Near You(opens in a new tab)](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/penndot/projects-near-you)\n\n#### Popular Topics\n\n*   [Driver & Vehicle Services](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/dmv)\n*   [Jobs at PennDOT](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/penndot/employment)\n*   [REAL ID](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/dmv/driver-services/real-id)\n*   [Online Services](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/penndot/programs-and-doing-business/online-services)\n*   [About Maintenance Activities](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/penndot/about-penndot/strategic-planning-and-operations/penndot-maintenance-activities.html)\n*   [Transportation Funding](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/penndot/about-penndot/transportation-funding)\n*   [Research, Planning & Innovation](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/penndot/research-planning-and-innovation)\n*   [Doing Business with PennDOT](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/penndot/programs-and-doing-business)\n*   [511PA Travel Info & Alerts](http://www.511pa.com/)\n*   [PennDOT Results & Metrics](https://www.penndot.pa.gov/about-us/Results/Pages/index.html)\n*   [PennDOT Projects](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/penndot/projects-near-you)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/penndot/about-penndot/penndot-faqs)\n*   [File a Title VI Discrimination Complaint](https://www.penndot.gov/services/penndot/file-a-title-vi-discrimination-complaint-against-penndot)\n*   [Language Assistance Services](https://www.penndot.gov/agencies/penndot/forms-and-publications/language-assistance-services)\n\n![Image 7](https://www.penndot.gov/content/experience-fragments/copapwp-pagov/en/penndot/report-a-roadway-concern-exf/master/_jcr_content/root/container/teaser/image.coreimg.jpeg/1725457070762/help.jpeg)\n\nHave a State Roadway Concern?\n-----------------------------\n\nThe PennDOT Customer Care Center can help get your question or concern in front of the right people.
