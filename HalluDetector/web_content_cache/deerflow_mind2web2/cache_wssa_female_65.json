It's Thursday, August 14, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.\n\n25 years ago Wikipedia was a dream. A wildly ambitious, probably impossible dream. A dream that came together piece by piece. Now, 65 million articles. 260,000 volunteers across the entire world. Here's to 25 years of knowledge, humanity, and collaboration at its best.\n\nMost readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.\n\n![Image 5: Wikimedia Foundation Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/donate/1/14/Wikimedia_Foundation_logo_-_wordmark.svg)\n\nProud host of Wikipedia and its sister sites\n\n How often would you like to donate? \n*   Once \n*   Monthly \n*   Annual \n\n Support Wikipedia year-round \n\n Thanks for your generous support \n\nPlease select an amount (USD)\n\nThe average donation in the United States is around$13.\n*   $2.75 \n*   $15 \n*   $25 \n*   $50 \n*   $100 \n*   $250 \n*   $500 \n*   Other amount Other \n\n- [x] I'll generously add a little to cover the transaction fees so you can keep 100% of my donation. \n\n Please select a payment method \n\n![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/donate/b/be/Trustly_logos_only.png)Online Banking \n\nCredit / Debit Card \n\nContinue Donate  one time Donate  monthly Donate  annually\n\nPlease select an amount (minimum $1)\n\nWe cannot accept donations greater than 25000 USD through our website.
