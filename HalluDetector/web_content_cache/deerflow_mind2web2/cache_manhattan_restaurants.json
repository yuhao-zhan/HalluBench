Yes, you can sample authentic ethnic food in New York City from A to Z. At least that’s what they say. But is that really true?\n\nWe set out on a delicious journey to prove that New York City does indeed offer every one of the world’s ethnic foods…from A to Z, in some of the world’s best restaurants.\n\nEveryone knows New York City is home to a myriad of ethnicities that showcase their rich cultures through their cuisines.\n\nIn the quest to identify and categorize these cuisines from A to Z we discovered some amazing new tastes and rediscovered old favorites.\n\nIt was a difficult task to sample all these cuisines but, hey, somebody had to do it. As cool as NYC’s ethnic cuisine is, it is just one of the [pros of living in New York City.](https://www.travelnewyorknow.com/pros-and-cons-of-living-in-new-york-city)\n\nThe criteria to select these restaurants was that they be ethnic (not typically American) and authentic representations of the food offered in the native country or region where they originated.\n\nIn deciding which cuisine would represent a letter, for example, “A” when many countries started with that same letter; Albania, Algeria, Afghanistan, Argentina, Angola, Armenia, we selected the country the team was most familiar with, at least in the first round, and could vouch for the authenticity of the cuisine.\n\nWe did our best to include the classic ethnic cuisines of the Big Apple like Chinese food and Indian food as well as some lesser know cuisines like Korean food.\n\nFrom fine dining in New York City to the ubiquitous hotdogs from food trucks, from swanky Upper East Side to rough-around the-edges Hell’s Kitchen, to Jackson Heights, the most ethnically diverse neighborhood in the United States and possibly on Earth, here’s our ethnic culinary journey through New York City A to Z.\n\n![Image 1: Images of ethnic cuisines in New York City](blob:http://localhost/1e4f3e66c4cb1600be14d5dec524bfd9)\n**AUTHENTIC ETHNIC RESTAURANTS IN [NEW YORK CITY](https://travelswithtalek.com/new-york-city-unique-things/)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n\n*   [A.

Argentina\n\nArgentinian food is all about meat and chimichurri, an Argentinian sauce made from cilantro, parsley, garlic, and other ingredients used to accompany meats.\n\nIn [Argentina](https://travelswithtalek.com/buenos-aires-travel-guide-tips-advice/), it is unheard of to serve meat without the ubiquitous chimichurri.[Libertador Restaurant](https://www.libertadornyc.com/) in Manhattan’s Upper East Side makes the best chimichurri I’ve ever tasted. That’s one of the ways you know the food is authentic.\n\nThe parrilladas (Argentine BBQ) are all made from grass-fed meat imported from Argentina. The empanadas are overstuffed with savory delights.\n\nThey have a great selection of wines from Argentina and other countries and they offer outside seating.\n\nOverall, a delightful Argentine experience in New York. A good example of one of the authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City.\n\n[![Image 2: authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer empanadas](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### B. Bolivia\n\nThis little gem was a total surprise. [Bolivian Llama Party](http://www.blp.nyc/) occupies a stand at Turnstyle Market below The Time Warner building. The food draws on the rich heritage of Bolivian cooking methods and ingredients to create delicious food.\n\nOne of the star attractions is the “Chola,” a sandwich stuffed with roast pork, bacon and pork belly or its diminutive, the “Cholita.”\n\nAnother tasty tidbit is the salteña, an empanada-like savory pastry which has been firmly entrenched in the culture for over 200 years. It comes stuffed with goodies like quinoa, and mushrooms.\n\nBolivian Llama Party is the brainchild of three brothers from Bolivia with a mission to expose New York to their native cuisine. It’s no surprise that this was chosen as one of the authentic ethnic restaurants of New York City.\n\nI predict Bolivian food might just be the “next-big-ethnic-food craze.” Sez who?…The New York Times, The Village Voice, Time Out, CNN and others. Try them and tell me if you don’t agree.\n\n[![Image 3: Cholas](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### C. Cuba\n\nThe Grand Dame of Cuban food in New York City is [Victor’s Cafe](https://victorscafe.com/). This restaurant started life in 1963 on Columbus Ave and 72nd street. It moved to the Theatre District in 1980 where it offers terrific Cuban food in its dramatically decorated dining room with Latin music at the bar most nights.\n\nVictor’s Cafe states on their website that “The Evolution of Cuban Cuisine”® is our interpretation of what an upscale Cuban restaurant would be in [Cuba](https://travelswithtalek.com/perfect-cuba-itinerary/) if politics had not interfered with its growth.”\n\nNew Yorkers have been flocking here for 55 years.In that time they have managed to remain true to the authenticity of the food as well as create interesting and delicious innovations.\n\nVictor’s Cafe has been one of the standards of the best ethnic food in NYC for decades.\n\nThere are many other [Cuban restaurants in New York City](https://travelswithtalek.com/evolution-cuban-cuisine-nyc-eat/). From the traditional eateries to the nouvo cuisine creations, it’s one of the most exciting cuisines in the city.\n\nVictor’s Cafe is among the best places for pre and after theater meals and any special occasion.\n\nFull disclosure: I went here on my first date with my now husband many years ago. It is my favorite ethnic restaurant in New York City.\n\n[![Image 4: Authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer Cuban style shrimp](blob:http://localhost/3ae4d04f916712e5394829daa66ef1f5)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n### D. Dominican Republic\n\n[Malecon](http://maleconrestaurants.com/) has two locations now, Broadway and 175th and Amsterdam and 97th. It also has authentic Dominican food worth waiting on line for.\n\nThey don’t miss a beat with their menu that includes offerings that you had forgotten all about because you thought you could only get them on the side streets of [Santo Domingo](https://travelswithtalek.com/punta-cana-safety-concerns-perception-vs-reality/) off Calle El Conde.\n\nThis cuisine entered the ranks of authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City and it is here to stay. No muss, no fuss, just solid good food at a good price.\n\n[![Image 5: Autentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer salmon Dominican style](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### E. Ethiopia\n\nIf you look up Ethiopian restaurants in New York City you get dozens of responses all over the city; The Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn.\n\nThis is one cuisine that that really took off in New York City. That was the gateway. Now you see Ethiopian food in many other cities.\n\nOne restaurant that really stands out is [Queen of Sheba.](https://www.shebanyc.com/) The success of this lovely restaurant in Manhattan’s Hells Kitchen is the typical immigrant success story.\n\nThe owner came to the United States in 1990 and worked at odd jobs saving money to open his own restaurant using the recipes and ingredients he learned from his mother in his tome town of Addis Ababa.\n\nPopular dishes include lamb and beef specialties. There is also an extensive vegetarian menu.\n\nIt’s fun to try something completely new with no preconceived ideas of what it will taste like. That’s why I ordered the Taste of Sheba combination sampler dish featuring a wide array of tasty Ethiopian tidbits. It was delicious!\n\nThe restaurant is cozy with friendly service. It has an interesting selection of Ethiopian wines.\n\nBTW, why do people call the neighborhood Hell’s Kitchen? There are two versions of the origin. One is that in the early 20th century this was a very dangerous neighborhood with riots and police officers referred to the area as Hell’s Kitchen.\n\nThe other is that around the same time there was a German diner there called Heil’s Kitchen and people mispronounced the name. Still, really makes for a colorful moniker.\n\n![Image 6](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)\n\n* * *\n\n### F. France\n\nOne of the high-end restaurants of the Upper East Side, the spacious and inviting [Cafe D’Alsace](https://www.cafedalsace.com/) was on Anthony Bourdain’s list of favorites.\n\nThat’s how I learned about it. It is not a budget location but it is an excellent value for your money selection.\n\nIt has an ample and varied menu and is authentically French with a specialization in the D’Alsace region, as the name implies.\n\nThey have outdoor dining in a very pleasant sidewalk cafe to chill in with a glass of white wine. A totally pleasant experience on the Upper East Side and a perfect example of authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City.\n\n[![Image 7: authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer sushi](blob:http://localhost/558ddb7306c65a878fbe11fa4df0b8cf)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### G. Germany\n\nThe area around 86th Street in the Upper East Side, often referred to as Yorkville, was called Germantown for many years. As early as the mid-1800s German immigrants settled in the neighborhood.\n\nThe early 1900s saw a dramatic influx of Germans moving north from the Lower East Side.\n\nUp until the 1930s, a large portion of the population in Yorkville spoke German. On 86th Street, in the center of Yorkville, there were many German shops, restaurants, and bakeries.\n\nMost of the authentic ethnic restaurants are gone but some of them remain today either in their original authentically German format or in a more modernized version.\n\n[Stube Quality Wursts](https://www.schallerstube.com/), right smack in the middle of Yorkville, is one such representation of delicious German wursts with an interesting variety of toppings. Sometimes an authentic German wurst and a beer are all you need to really hit the spot.\n\n[![Image 8](blob:http://localhost/f9f342b4ad5f10d39492e87d2388acad)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)[![Image 9: authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer sushi](blob:http://localhost/558ddb7306c65a878fbe11fa4df0b8cf)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### H. Hungary\n\nSimilar to German populations, Hungarians also settled in the Yorkville area, especially around 79th Street. Many authentic ethnic Hungarian restaurants, butcher shops and specialty import stores dotted the neighborhood.\n\nThere are still churches there serving the Hungarian population. East 82nd Street is also named St. Stephen of Hungary Way and the area from East 79th to 83rd Streets is known as Little Hungary.\n\nSome specialized stores remain including the aptly named [Cafe Budapest](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d2042819-Reviews-Budapest_Cafe_and_Restaurant-New_York_City_New_York.html) on 2nd Avenue. They serve Hungarian food as traditional and authentic as you can get, in a cozy inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe classics include chicken paprika and stuffed cabbage but they have much more. Despite the yummy entrees, the Hungarian desserts are the real stars here; homemade flaky pastries stuffed with creams and bursting with fruits.\n\nThis is a great place to immerse yourself in the culture through its food.\n\n[![Image 10: authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer Hungarian pastries](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### I. India\n\nI really enjoy [Spice Symphony](http://spicesymphony.com/). This is not just another Indian restaurant. I’ve been coming here for years and it is consistently good.\n\nWhat originally attracted me to this welcoming Indian restaurant in the first place was their claim to specialize in Indo-Chinese food. A good example of [fusion cuisine](https://travelswithtalek.com/fusion-cuisine/).\n\nIt turns out the Indo-Chinese connection originates in Kolkata in north-eastern India.\n\nChinese settled in that Indian city and the two cultures blended together to create a distinct and delicious cuisine. That combination of two of my favorite foods alone was enough to lure me in.\n\nThese are truly unique dishes.\n\nOnce inside I saw curry goat on the menu and that was it. I was hooked. Their desserts are also delicious with subtle tastes – mango! – and delicate textures.\n\nThis is a great place to go for delicious Indian cuisine.\n\n[![Image 11: authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer Indian samosas. ](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### J. Japan\n\nWe used to live in just above Manhattan, in Riverdale, a nice neighborhood in the Bronx. Every Friday after work we would make it a ritual to go to [Aoyu Sushi](http://aoyusushi.com/) for a nice night out in an authentic Japanese restaurant.\n\nAfter trying out dozens of sushi restaurants in New York we found Aoyu to be the best bang for your buck. For just $25 you could get a full nigiri platter of fresh sushi straight of the Tsukiji fish market in Japan.\n\nThe fish served here was always of the highest quality, made by real Japanese sushi chefs, and served to us by real Japanese people.\n\nFrom the free green tea to the decor, to the sushi, I loved every one of my Friday nights here. Even if you aren’t planning to visit the Bronx I would highly recommend a visit here if you are in the mood for authentic sushi.\n\nIt’s easy to get to. Here are[the directions.](https://www.google.com.mx/maps/dir/''/aoyu+sushi+bronx/data=!4m5!4m4!1m0!1m2!1m1!1s0x89c2f3bf1e0da98f:0xe1b1056f4ce374be?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwilqs2bkenbAhUOZawKHTP3DI0Q9RcIhQEwCw) And if you’re looking for other [romantic things to do in New York City](https://theworldpursuit.com/romantic-things-nyc/), check these out.\n\n[![Image 12: authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer sushi](blob:http://localhost/558ddb7306c65a878fbe11fa4df0b8cf)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\nCameron and Natasha blog at[The World Pursuit](https://theworldpursuit.com/)\n\n* * *\n\n### K. Korea\n\nBoth Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmerman raved about this place.\n\nZimmerman’s review is in the window (along with dozens of others) and the headline asks, “Is this the best restaurant in the world?” Well, I’m not one for hyperbole but…OMG! is this good!\n\n[New Wonjo](http://newwonjo.com/) is right smack in the center of Koreatown on West 32nd Street. Here is where I learned to love Korean food.\n\nEvery time I’ve been here there has been a long wait to get in but it is so worth it. They have the best Korean BBQ.\n\nThe classic Korean BBQ is upstairs. The first floor is reserved for non-BBQ, traditional Korean fare.\n\nThey start you off with those delightful multiple small plates that grace classic Korean meals and it’s all mouth-watering delight after that.\n\nIf this is not one of the best ethnic restaurants in NYC, it’s close to it.\n\n[![Image 13: authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer goat stew](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### L. Lebanon\n\nThe line for [Naya](https://www.eatnaya.com/) at 54 West 56th street, at least at lunchtime, is almost all the way down to the end of the street. At first, I wasn’t really sure what the line was for.\n\nThere was such a crowd of people outside the door, it couldn’t be for people waiting to get in…could it? After figuring out it WAS actually for the restaurant I got in the queue which, thankfully moved very quickly.\n\nOnce inside this pleasant, efficient eating establishment, you see why the line moves so quickly. The team behind the counter at this Middle Eastern restaurant is super-fast. And the food is super good.\n\nMiddle Eastern food at its most authentic, freshest and best.\n\n[![Image 14: authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer Middle Eastern food](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### M. Malaysia\n\nIf you’re looking for authentic Malaysian food in New York, be sure to visit [Taste Good](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g47681-d541900-Reviews-Taste_Good_Malaysian_Cuisine-Elmhurst_Queens_New_York.html). This cash-only Malaysian restaurant looks like a hole in the wall—and it is, however, there’s no denying how good their food is.\n\nOne of the reasons that I fell in love with Malaysia was the food and I was convinced that I’d be unable to find the same authentic food once I returned from my Southeast Asia trip.\n\nI was delighted to find this slightly out of the way restaurant in Elmhurst, Queens. I loved the Singapore Laksa, one of the most popular dishes, which felt like I was back in Singapore.\n\n[![Image 15: Yemeni food.](blob:http://localhost/4fe80b764bc327e692f871b502d8bbed)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\nHas this whetted your appetite for Malaysian food but you never heard of Elmhurst so you don’t know how to get there? Worry not! Check out this handy, comprehensive [guide to NYC subways](https://www.wanderlustingk.com/travel-blog/nyc-subway-guide) and you’ll be in Elmhurst downing Singaporean Laksa like a pro in no time.\n\nKaren blogs at [Wanderlustingk](https://www.wanderlustingk.com/)\n\n* * *\n\n### N. Nepal\n\nThis unassuming little neighborhood gem in Jackson Heights will do more than surprise you with its tasty fare, it will absolutely delight you. [Thakali Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/nycthakalikitchen/) offers authentic fine Nepalese cuisine.\n\nIt is cozy, comfortable and so much fun to try the different menu selections. The staff is very helpful. Just tell them the type of food you like, and they will make suggestions that invariably hit the mark.\n\nOne of the most fun things about Thakali is its location. It is in the middle of Jackson Heights, the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods on planet earth. It is just a few blocks from [New York City’s #7 train.](https://travelswithtalek.com/beneath-new-yorks-7-train/)\n\n[![Image 16: Authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer Nepalese food.](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### O. Osaka\n\nJapanese street food, particularly that found in Osaka, is in a category by itself. That is why here it is treated as separate from the cuisine of greater Japan.\n\nOne of the key components of Osaka street food is the okonomiyaki, a savory pancake concoction consisting of flour, shredded cabbage, and various meat toppings.\n\nOkonomiyaki means “as you like it grill.” You can find a totally authentic version in [Otafuku](https://www.otafukuny.com/) on east 9th street in the East Village. Get the pork combo and they’ll throw in an order of takoyaki with fat little chunks of octopus.\n\n[Otafuku](https://www.otafukuny.com/) is the Japanese goddess of mirth. Her job is to make you happy and these tasty pancakes will do just that.\n\n[![Image 17: Authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer food from Osaka. ](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### P. Peru\n\nPeruvian food has rapidly and methodically climbed its way into the ranks of top ethnic foods in NYC. And [Pio-Pio](https://www.piopio.com/) (the sound a Spanish-speaking chicken makes) is right up there with the best of them.\n\nI first discovered them in Jackson Heights many years ago and was blown away by the taste of their signature dish, chicken flavored with lime. My, how they’ve grown.\n\nThere are now 9 Pio-Pios strategically situated all over the city. I figured I’d try something other than chicken this time and ordered the seafood ceviche. It was even better!\n\n[![Image 18: Authentic rthnic restaurants in New York City offer Peruvian food. ](blob:http://localhost/d8fab72ddc786104ff5fcbebc135b5b2)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### Q. Quebecois\n\nQuebecois food. That’s food from Quebec. (Canada is ethnic.) And the humble poutine, the classic Quebecois comfort food, is alive and well in New York City’s Hell’s Kitchen.\n\n[Jaspers Taphouse and Kitchen](https://www.jaspersnyc.com/) is a fun place on 9th Avenue and 51st, in the Theater District. You can’t get poutine in a lot of places in NYC.\n\nBelieve me, I’ve tried. But here is a place where they actually seem to have improved on the original you get in Old Quebec.\n\n[![Image 19: Authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer poutine. ](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### R. Russia\n\nAnd now for something completely different. The [Russian Samovar](https://russiansamovar.com/new-york-theater-district-russian-samovar-food-menu) in New York City’s Theater District serves delicious authentic Russian, offers live music and a killer Happy Hour.\n\nThe bar was once the setting for the movie, The Manchurian Candidate. But the back story gets even better.\n\nTurns out this restaurant, previously know as Jilly’s Canteen, was once owned by a good friend of Frank Sinatra. Sinatra, Johnny Carson and other celebrities frequented the restaurant which became known as a hang out for the famous.\n\nThe restaurant changed hands and became the Russian Samovar but the decor, as especially the famous bar, stayed the same.\n\nToday the Russian Samovar offers traditional Russian food and remains one of New York City’s true authentic ethnic restaurants.\n\n![Image 20](blob:http://localhost/4283e57e68d0bd7a6edb159ee69eed06)![Image 21: Yemeni food.](blob:http://localhost/4fe80b764bc327e692f871b502d8bbed)\n\n* * *\n\n### S. Spain\n\nI always wondered why tapas were not more popular in the United States.One of the best food experiences you can have is wandering in and out of tapas bars in [Spain](https://travelswithtalek.com/asturias-spains-underrated-province/).\n\nSpain, along with Italy, France, and China, is one of those countries you speak of in hushed, respectful tones when you speak of its cuisine.\n\n[Boqueria](https://boqueriarestaurant.com/) does this legacy justice. Named after the iconic and colorful Barcelona food market, Boqueria serves up tapas, both traditional, and with its own twist.\n\nThe place is packed most times but you can always squeeze in while you’re waiting for a table or a seat at the bar.Try anything here. It is all good.\n\nAnd the wine pairings only serve to enhance the experience. Boqueria’s success has led to the opening of six locations in New York City and D.C.\n\n[![Image 22: Authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer tapas. ](blob:http://localhost/899d43652b82d688dcad5cf1b68a1939)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### T. Thailand\n\nIf you like Thai food, you’ll love [Little Thai Kitchen](https://www.littlethaikitchenmidtown.com/gallery), the home of one of the best authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City.\n\nLTK started life in 2007 on East 53rd Street, Midtown adding yet another great Thai restaurant to New York City. Today it continues the Thai food revolution.\n\nThe word “mouthwatering” was invented just so it could describe this food. The flavors are so subtle. They’ve got a thumbs up from just about every New York food critic and with good reason.\n\nI always tell myself I’m going to try something different when I go there but invariably end up ordering the curry, it’s soooo good!\n\n[![Image 23: Thai food. ](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### U. Ukraine\n\nApparently Veselka was one of the top authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City 60 years ago and has retained that spot ever since.\n\nI have to admit I did not know much about Ukranian food going into this. I assumed it was similar to Russian or Polish cuisine which I really like.\n\nYes, there are similarities but, I am told by Ukrainians who know their stuff, that the food in [Veselka](http://www.veselka.com/) is unique, authentic and tastes like the food back home in Kiev.\n\nThey have a large menu that the staff will be happy to help you with. The delicious dishes are comfort food at its finest.\n\nHave the perogies! I don’t normally love beets but I tried the beet soup on a whim and immediately became a beet believer.\n\nVeselka’s got a great back-story. The neighborhood where Veselka is located, in New York City’s East Village, was home to a large Slavic community.\n\nIn the 1950s, many Slavic shops and restaurants lined Second Avenue and the side streets.\n\nYou can still see vestiges of this community in the local churches, community centers and the few Slavic restaurants that remain.\n\nVeselka itself has been there since 1954. They are open 24 hours and opened another location in The Bowery in 2011.\n\n[![Image 24: Ukranian food.](blob:http://localhost/a2483d659c53c88a71cc031ee98cdd80)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### V. Vietnam\n\n[Pho Sandwich Shop](https://phoshopnyc.com/) on the Upper East Side is much more than a sandwich shop. It is a full service, sit-down restaurant with friendly staff, pleasant environment and some of the best Vietnamese food outside of Vietnam.\n\nFor some strange reason, it is difficult to get authentic Vietnamese food. I don’t know if they flavor it for American tastes or they can’t get the right ingredients.\n\nSo many times I’ve left a Vietnamese restaurant missing the authentic, fresh herbs tastes I’m familiar with from Vietnam. But this place does not disappoint. It’s the real deal! P.S. Order the duck.\n\n[![Image 25: Authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer Vietnamese food. ](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### W. Wales\n\nYou thought I was going to have trouble coming up with a “W” huh? Well, not only do I have Wales on this list, I found that the country’s cuisine is delightfully complex with variety and taste. This find was a treat!\n\n[Snowdonia](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29837-d4948311-Reviews-Snowdonia-Astoria_Queens_New_York.html), in Astoria, Queens is a cozy corner restaurant and bar with outdoor seating and two cute Schnauzers wandering about.\n\nThe restaurant is named for a mountainous region in Wales which is also a national park. The menu had a wide variety of options I was totally unfamiliar with so I ordered a Welsh sampler.\n\n![Image 26: Welsh Sampler at Snowdonia restaurant](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)\nThe sampler came with glamorgans, a Welsh vegetarian sausage made with leeks and cheese and the famous Welsh rarebit among other things.\n\nI always thought it was Welsh “rabbit” and wondered where the rabbit was;don’t laugh at me, you thought the same thing.\n\nRarebit is a hot cheese sauce over bread with different little toppings to put on the bread. It’s like a Welsh tapas dish and the perfect accompaniment to one of Snowdonia’s craft beers.\n\n![Image 27: Snowdonia sign](blob:http://localhost/48db7f9064316ba79a68ff7292e8d2a9)\nWhatever you do, don’t forget the dessert! They have a nice selection but the sticky toffee pudding is to die for.\n\n* * *\n\n### X. Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, China\n\nThe city of Xi’an in Shaanxi province with a population of about 40 million, is in a class by itself when it comes to a culinary tradition. [Xi’an Famous Foods](https://www.xianfoods.com/) brings this tradition to New York City with as authentic a representation as you can find.\n\nThis is another Anthony Bourdain find. The newspaper clipping on the wall tells the story of when Bourdain showed up at the original restaurant in Flushing, Queens with a camera crew.\n\n“There is a tall, white guy here with a camera crew,” the owner said to his son on the phone. His son figured out who the “tall, white guy” was and engaged in what would be a nice friendship.\n\nBourdain recommended the restaurant and [Xi’an Famous Foods](https://www.xianfoods.com/) grew. They would have done it even without Bourdain – the food is THAT good – but the association helped.\n\nThe wide assortment of dumplings is delicious as are the ox-tail soup and pork sandwiches. It all tastes like the food you get in similar restaurants in Xi’an.\n\nThey are one of the perfect authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City.\n\n[![Image 28: Authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City offer Xi'an food.](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)[![Image 29](blob:http://localhost/1f407e4bd90021f5369ae25fb43ffc20)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### Y. Yemen\n\n[Saba Restaurant and Grill](https://www.yelp.com/biz/saba-restaurant-and-grill-long-island-city) is my recent discovery for delicious Yemeni cuisine and is now officially one of my favorite foods. Who knew this was going to be one of the most authentic ethnic restaurants in New York City?\n\nIf I wasn’t running around looking for countries that start with the letter “Y” that also had restaurants in town, I probably never would have been exposed to Yemeni food.\n\nThe bread is OMG-this-is-amazing-good; all crispy on the outside and fluffy and slightly salty on the inside. The lamb really does fall off the bone -I should have taken a video of that- that’s how tender it is.\n\nThe place is a modest establishment on Steinway in Astoria, Queens in a neighborhood with a large Middle Eastern population.\n\nWe ordered one appetizer and one entre for two. We got so much food we took half home and had one more meal.\n\nYou can’t beat the value proposition here; really good, perfectly seasoned food very reasonably priced.\n\n[![Image 30: Yemeni food.](blob:http://localhost/4fe80b764bc327e692f871b502d8bbed)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=)\n\n* * *\n\n### Z. Zambia, Africa\n\nZambia is a country in south central Africa that takes its name from the [Zambezi River](https://travelswithtalek.com/rafting-zambezi-river/). Zambian food is rich in spices especially pepper.\n\nMany Zambian meals contain nshima, made from powdered maize. It is a side dish similar to rice or potatoes used to accompany proteins like lamb or fish.\n\nThe best place to get African food from all regions of the continent is Harlem in upper [Manhattan](https://travelswithtalek.com/the-10-coolest-neighborhoods-in-manhattan/). And one authentic restaurant in [Harlem](https://travelswithtalek.com/visit-harlem/) that serves yummy African food is [La Savane](http://www.lasavanerestaurant.com/).\n\nLa Savane is officially an Ivoirian restaurant, from the Ivory Coast in West Africa but their recipes come from all over Africa including Zambia.\n\nThe staff is Senegalese, one of [New York City](https://travelswithtalek.com/new-york-city-unique-things/)‘s newest immigrants, so there are several Senegalese dishes on the menu.\n\nIf you’re looking for an out of the ordinary dining experience with a unique cuisine, give La Savane a try.\n\n![Image 31: Zambian food](blob:http://localhost/e12dc2aba75850a9ab578ab9e14b58d4)\nClearly this is not an exhaustive list as there are multiple ethnic restaurants on any one block in NYC.
