It’s one of those dishes that has caught on like wildfire in larger Chinese cities, and many restaurants have added it to their menus. This Chinese chicken stew recipe originated in the [Xinjiang, China](http://amzn.to/2CIhnxr) where bold and tasty spices are used like in our [Xinjiang Fried Chicken](https://thewoksoflife.com/2014/05/fried-chicken-w-xinjiang-spices/ \"Fried Chicken w/ Xinjiang Spices\").\n\n大盘鸡, _da pan ji_ also has a special place in my heart, because it makes me miss China—especially all that wonderful food. We’re all reminiscing about it these days—the ability to just walk out of the apartment, hail a cab for 3 bucks, and have a big, wonderful meal for 20-30 bucks. You can’t beat it.\n\nI’m not going to lie, authentic big plate chicken should probably be cooked with a whole chicken, cut into small pieces with bones and skin still intact. That’s how it’s made in restaurants in China, and it’s a well-known fact that Asians love to gnaw on bones (plus, meat on the bone tends to be more tender and juicier). I’ve decided not to put you through that whole chicken preparation process, so we’re going to use the next best thing: boneless chicken thighs.\n\nI think the brilliance of “big plate chicken”is in the noodles at the bottom of the plate, which soak up all the wonderful sauce. We hope you and your families will enjoy this truly wonderful one plate meal!

Drain.\n\nOnce the potatoes are cooked through, by now, there should be at least 1 – 1-1/2 cup of liquid in the wok, so add more water if needed. To your wok, stir in the bell peppers. Cover and simmer for another 5 minutes. Add the [scallions](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-chives-scallions-aromatics-peppers/), and season with salt to taste.\n\n![Image 7: Big Plate Chicken (Chinese Da Pan Ji) with Noodles, by thewoksoflife.com](blob:http://localhost/dd9cf96aac438c09a903d30518987df7)\nNote: If you want more sauce, add a little more water to the wok.

It’s light, refreshing and easy to make in just 10 minutes. It’s also packed with flavor from a zingy dressing, garlic, and cilantro.\n\n_Note: This recipe was originally published in June 2015. We’ve since updated it with higher resolution images, clearer instructions, a YouTube video showing how to make it, and metric measurements. The recipe remains the same. Enjoy!_\n\nThe Benefits of Cucumber\n------------------------\n\nIn our family, I’m the resident whacky Chinese medicine enthusiast. I drink the elixirs (check out Sarah’s experience from way back when[here](https://thewoksoflife.com/2013/06/the-joys-of-drinking-rancid-bark-juice/ \"THE JOYS OF DRINKING RANCID BARK JUICE\")), do acupuncture, read the most books, and enjoy the healing powers of a good Chinese foot massage.\n\nSo I’ll start this recipe by saying, everyone knows that cucumber salad is a great summer dish. But do you know about its health benefits?\n\nAccording to TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), cucumber cleanses and detoxifies, it helps reduce high blood pressure, and, with its “cooling” element, also eases the internal heat of the body.In short,eat plenty of cucumber when it’s in season!\n\nIn the U.S., you might find a Greek salad, a dill pickle here and there, and perhaps a pitcher of cucumber water.\n\nBut people in China take eating cucumbers to a whole new level. For example, we Americans would probably enjoy an ice cream cone (or gnaw on a turkey leg if you’re at Disney World) when visiting a park or a zoo.\n\nBut in China, you can see people crunching on cucumbers as they walk around, ride the train, or take a rest on the Great Wall. It’s an everywhere, anytime snack. Fruit peddlers peel them for you and they’re only RMB 1.00 (15 cents at the time of this writing) a piece. A bargain!\n\nThis Asian cucumber salad is also a popular appetizer/cold dish (凉菜) on most restaurant menus. Not only is it so easy to whip up, it’s crunchy, crispy, and healthy. We make this on a weekly basis when we have cucumbers in the garden, because it’s so simple and refreshing!\n\n![Image 2: Chinese cucumber salad](blob:http://localhost/959adaf9159bdd7d987f52b44327304c)\nThe Smashing Technique\n----------------------\n\nThe key to this salad is to smash the cucumbers with a heavy cleaver (or rolling pin). This method creates lots of jagged edges for the tasty dressing to cling to. This method is common in China!\n\nSince we first published this recipe over 10 years ago, this smashing method has spread across the English-speaking internet as well. It really does create a nice texture.\n\nSmashing and opening up the cucumbers also means that they will release a lot of water once you add the dressing (the salt in the dressing draws out liquid). So make sure you dress the salad right before serving! Don’t let it sit around too long, or the dressing will start to dilute.\n\nAsian Cucumber Salad: Recipe Instructions\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMake the salad dressing by combining the salt, sugar, [sesame oil](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-sauces-vinegars-oils/#sesame-oil), [light soy sauce](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-sauces-vinegars-oils/), and [rice vinegar](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-sauces-vinegars-oils/#rice-vinegar). Stir until the sugar and salt are completely dissolved.\n\nWash the cucumbers and pat them dry with a clean towel. On a cutting board, lay a [large knife](https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to/chinese-cooking-tools/#cleaver) flat against the cucumber, and smash it lightly with your other hand. The cucumber should crack open and smash into four sections.\n\n![Image 3: Chinese cucumber salad](blob:http://localhost/959adaf9159bdd7d987f52b44327304c)\nRepeat along its full length. Once the whole cucumber is completely open (usually into 4 long sectional pieces), cut it on a 45-degree angle into bite-sized pieces.\n\n![Image 4](blob:http://localhost/80bce10e1835ce620572c60c7e37d681)\n### NOTE!\n\nSee Kaitlin’s recipe for [homemade chili oil](https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-make-chili-oil/), which is what we always use when we make Cucumber Salad. If you prefer to omit the chili oil, heat up a tablespoon of oil in a pan and drizzle it over the cucumber. Seems weird, but in Chinese cooking, uncooked vs. cooked oil have different flavors and are treated as such!\n\nIn a large bowl, mix the cut cucumber with the prepared dressing, [garlic](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-chives-scallions-aromatics-peppers/#garlic) and [chili oil](https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-make-chili-oil/) (or cooked plain oil), and toss it well.
