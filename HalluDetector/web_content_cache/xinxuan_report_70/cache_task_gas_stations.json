She and a couple friends from the UF Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering turned the conference into a road trip to remember, making new friends and memories at INFORMS. Eighteen years later, Dionne remains an enthusiastic member of INFORMS who wants to help all members enjoy and gain as much value from their involvement with INFORMS as she has. Dionne’s first service to INFORMS was as a session chair at the 2006 Annual Meeting, then invited session organizer in 2007, and treasurer of the Health Applications Section (HAS) in 2008. These opportunities gave Dionne a passion for connecting researchers and educators to elevate their work. She has since served as chair of HAS, overseeing its promotion from Section to Society; president of the Public Sector OR Section; president of the Junior Faculty Interest Group; chair of INFORM-ED (Forum on Education); and TutORials \n\nco-chair. She currently serves on the Committee on Teaching and Learning. In 2016, Dionne was awarded the Volunteer Service Award, Distinguished Level, “to recognize exceptional volunteer service to INFORMS.” Within Canada, Dionne is a two-term past president of the Canadian Operational Research Society (CORS/SCRO), where she also served as CORS Council Secretary and Secretary of the Health Care Operations Research Special Interest Group. In 2019, she was awarded the Eldon Gunn Service Award for “outstanding contributions of time and service to the Society.” Dionne holds BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees from the UF Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, which is unsurprising as she comes from a family of Gators, many of whom are industrial engineers. However, she is the only one who has earned a PhD. She is now an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto, with appointments in the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation; Institute for Pandemics; and the University Health Network Techna Institute. Dionne is also co-lead for the Toronto-Manchester Joint Translational Centre for Digital Health and is a member of the Public Health Agency of Canada’s external experts COVID-19 modeling group. Her research focuses on the application of O.R. to medical and healthcare systems to improve the quality, timeliness, and efficiency of care. This research includes using optimization, simulation, machine learning, and graph theory to solve problems in pandemic modeling, radiation therapy, hospital scheduling, and organ transplant matching. This research has been supported by NSERC, CIHR, CFI, ORF, and NSF. In her spare time, Dionne enjoys watching football (Go Gators, Go Dolphins!) and baseball (Go Blue Jays!) and playing tennis. She would be remiss for not acknowledging that her career has been made possible by the unwavering support and patience of her much smarter, more likeable wife, Nancy. \n\n# SALUTE OUR SPONSORS \n\nPlatinum Conference Sponsors Edelman Award Ceremony Sponsors        \n\n> SCIENTIFIC SOLUTIONS 8I2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I9\n\n# CO-HOST OF CEREMONY \n\nZahir Balaporia, CAP, FICO Xpress Optimization \n\n# Zahir’s engagement with INFORMS started in the late 1990s as conference attendee and occasional presenter. The 2001 INFORMS Practice Conference (now Analytics Conference) is where he truly fell in love with the event, thanks to its focused emphasis on the deployment of solutions in practice. Presenters across a diverse set of organizations shared successes and challenges, which as a young practitioner challenged with implementing complex models, was the best group therapy he could have asked for. After graduate school, Zahir started his career in manufacturing, leading projects for process improvement, building optimization models for production sequencing, and building simulation models for capacity sizing and capital investments. He then joined Schneider, a $4B+ transportation and logistics company, where he spent the next 19 years working in a variety of challenging and fulfilling roles. His teams specialized in the application of advanced analytics for decision support across the enterprise in areas such as network planning, supply chain design, vehicle routing, predictive risk, and driver assignment. In 2006, Zahir was part of the Engineering and Research team at Schneider National that was awarded the INFORMS Prize. In 2015, Zahir joined FICO’s Xpress Optimization team where he supports FICO’s customers in North America, South America, and Europe. With more than 25 years of experience developing and deploying advanced analytics solutions, Zahir has been instrumental in FICO’s growth across supply chain, transportation, logistics, and manufacturing. He also specializes in change management associated with deploying advanced analytics, which focuses on combining FICO’s leading technology with solution design ideas that lead to strong solutions adoption by decision makers. His work has been profiled in the books “Only Humans Need Apply – Winners and Losers in the Age of Smart Machines” by Davenport and Kirby and “The New Know” by Thornton May. Zahir has a BS in computer engineering from Clarkson University, an MS in industrial engineering from Purdue University, and an MS in system dynamics from Worcester Polytechnique Institute. Zahir has actively volunteered with INFORMS since 2007, primarily on the Analytics Conference committee as track chair/co-chair. He was the Analytics Conference chair in 2009 and co-chairs the Analytics Leadership track. He was president of the Analytics Section (now Society) in 2012 and co-founded the Executive Forum at the Business Analytics Conference. While he is very proud of his volunteer contributions, he is especially proud of being a co-founder of The Algorhythmics, the unofficial INFORMS band. In his spare time, Zahir enjoys playing music, golfing, and traveling with his wife Meherrnaz and their two wonderful children. He continues to maintain his unbroken attendance streak at the Business Analytics Conference, which started in 2001, and hopes to keep it going for many years to come. 10 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 11 \n\n# ANAL YTICS ANALYTICS \n\n# AND AND \n\n# OPER ATIO NS OPERATIONS \n\n# RESE ARCH RESEARCH \n\n# TODAY TODAY \n\n# 2021 EDELMAN PROGRAM NOTES \n\nBy Stephen Graves, INFORMS President \n\n# It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 2021 Edelman Award Ceremony to recognize and celebrate how members in our community are saving lives, saving money, and solving some of the world’s most challenging problems with operations research (O.R.) and analytics. Thank you for joining me and the rest of the INFORMS community as we celebrate this year’s recipients of four of INFORMS’ most esteemed awards: Daniel H. Wagner Prize for Excellence in Operations Research Practice; UPS George D. Smith Prize; INFORMS Prize; and the Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Advanced Analytics, Operations Research, and Management Science .The hard work and incredible contributions of this year’s finalists not only showcase to the rest of the world the transformative power of O.R. and analytics but serve to guide and inspire the next generation of O.R. and analytics researchers and professionals. These contributions, and the dedication and hard work of our finalist teams, are the culmination of years of hard work and represent a dedication to the highest levels of excellence. \n\nDaniel H. Wagner Prize for Excellence in Operations Research Practice \n\nFor the past 20 years, the Daniel H. Wagner Prize has recognized strong mathematics applied to practical problems that not only have a significant impact in application, but are communicated with clean, intelligent writing. In 2020, the Wagner Prize was presented to a team of researcher’s from The Pennsylvania State University, The University of Texas at Austin, and the University of British Columbia for their contribution to increasing efficiency in product planning and supply in agribusiness. Focusing on the commercial seed corn business, the researchers work, “Distribution Estimation and Efficient Optimization for Portfolio Management in Agribusiness: Analytical Developments and Benefits,” identified unique, cutting-edge applications of O.R. and analytics to improve the distribution and performance of crops, realizing both monetary and nonmonetary benefits. \n\nUPS George D. Smith Prize \n\nEach year, the INFORMS UPS George D. Smith Prize recognizes universities that develop and maintain a strong relationship between their students and industry partners to help better prepare the next generation of O.R. and analytics practitioners. The award is named in honor of the late UPS chief executive officer, and the Smith Prize finalists are selected from among the leading O.R. and analytics programs at universities around the world. This year, the finalists are: University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Gies College of Business; University of Iowa, Department of Business Analytics; and University of Minnesota, Information & Decision Sciences Department at the Carlson School of Management. \n\nINFORMS Prize \n\nThe INFORMS Prize is presented each year to organizations with a strong commitment to and effective integration of O.R. and analytics into its decision-making process, maintaining multiple initiatives with lasting impacts over time. Over the years, the INFORMS Prize has been presented to leading organizations including UPS, Booz Allen Hamilton, BNSF Railway, Walt Disney Company, U.S. Air Force, General Motors, Intel, HP, IBM, Ford, Procter & Gamble, and GE Research. Amazon has been selected as the recipient of the 2021 INFORMS Prize, for their dedication and commitment to maintain a dynamic O.R. and analytics program over several decades. \n\nFranz Edelman Award for Achievement in Advanced Analytics, Operations Research, and Management Science \n\nThe world’s most prestigious award for achievement in the practice of O.R. and advanced analytics, the Franz Edelman Award annually recognizes organizations whose applications of O.R. and analytics have transformed the world around us. This year’s finalists have made revolutionary contributions in robotics, cruise industry pricing and booking, railway planning and productivity, IT system sustainability, corporate decision making, and retail inventory operations. The 2021 Franz Edelman Award finalists are Alibaba, JD.com, Lenovo, Memorial Sloan Kettering, OCP, and The United Nations World Food Programme. A pioneering retail model enables the delivery of Alibaba’s e-commerce and grocery products to customers through its logistics networks in 30 minutes to two hours from the time their order was placed. A vehicle routing algorithm was designed to optimize warehouse order picking operations and delivery routes. The algorithms are built on large neighborhood searches and deep reinforcement learning and can achieve near optimal performance under tight computational time limitations. Ten years ago, JD.com pioneered same-day delivery as a standard service in China. By building automated warehouses, JD.com uses analytics to improve warehouse efficiency, while maintaining the balance between urgently growing demand and high-quality service. These agile warehouse systems enable JD.com to handle peak sales seasons (when order volume \n\ncan increase as much as 10 times the normal volume), reduce storage costs by 50%, and realize hundreds of millions of dollars insavings. In an increasingly competitive world, Lenovo’s in-house manufacturing facilities have cemented its leadership in the PC, smartphone, and data center industries. Lenovo uses a revolutionary AI-enabled production planning and scheduling system to maintain efficiency while balancing increasing complexity and an ever-growing product portfolio. This system has significantly improved utilization and customer fulfillment rates while simultaneously increasing production volumes. In particular, at Lenovo’s largest PC factory, production efficiency has increased by 18% leading to higher profitability and improved customer experience. Of the roughly 18 million new cancer cases diagnosed each year, half will be treated with radiotherapy that uses customized penetrating radiation beams to attack and defeat cancer cells without harming the surrounding healthy tissue. Using advanced optimization tools, Memorial Sloan Kettering has greatly improved the radiotherapy treatment planning process, treating more than 3,000 patients to date, with a much broader impact on patient care. As the world’s largest phosphate processing and exporting group, OCP \n\nemploys optimization models to enhance production, marketing, and logistical processes. Last year, these tools helped OCP realize incremental annual profits of ~$400 million. In addition, this focus on optimization has led to innovation and entrepreneurship becoming core pillars to OCP’s culture and led to the development of the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco, at which analytics plays a central role. The leading global humanitarian organization and 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), leverages analytics to deliver food assistance in emergencies and works within communities to improve nutrition and build resilience. In 2020 alone, WFP provided assistance to nearly 100 million people across 88 countries. Using analytics, WFP manages a large and complex humanitarian operation to reach more people, respond to emergencies faster, and realize significant savings all while supporting and empowering communities. Thank you for joining us for this special virtual Edelman Award Ceremony. While this past year has been marked with challenges, it has also served as a global reminder to the power and impact of O.R. and analytics around the world. And contributions like those of our finalist teams make a huge impact, as all of us at INFORMS – members, staff, leadership, volunteers, and more – continue to spread the word of the many incredible ways that O.R. and analytics are saving lives, saving money, and solving problems. 14 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 15 \n\n# ENRICHING THE LIVES OF EVERY PERSON ON EARTH \n\nReflections on Winning the 2020 Franz Edelman Award \n\nBy Kalani Ching, Intel \n\n# Intel put the “silicon” in Silicon Valley, and today our technology remains at the core of the most exciting, life-changing innovations on the planet. For more than 50 years, Intel and its people have had a profound influence on society. More than 110,000 Intel employees are shaping the future with computing and connectivity technologies. Together, we address the world’s greatest challenges as well as helping secure, power, and connect billions of devices in a connected world – from the cloud to the network to the edge and everything in between. Intel has been on a journey to redefine its position in the industry: from CPU to XPU, multi-architecture company; from a silicon focus to a platform focus including silicon, software, and services; and from a traditional integrated device manufacturer (IDM) to a modern, even more flexible IDM. Intel maintains an urgent focus on execution to deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products to its customers. We leverage manufacturing expertise, vast intellectual property (IP), and engineering innovations that give Intel increased flexibility to design and manufacture products in ways our competitors can’t match. Leading in the future means living up to our stated purpose: to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on Earth. Intel holds a strong position in the semiconductor industry as one the few remaining IDMs. Most semiconductor companies are “fabless,” which means they design their own products but do not own manufacturing operations. Other companies in the industry focus only on manufacturing, building the products designed by the fabless companies. Intel is one of the few companies that both designs and manufactures its products. At any given point in time, Intel is delivering hundreds of different products to its customer base through its large and complex supply chain, while simultaneously designing the next generation of products to meet its global customers’ needs. The work featured in the 2020 Franz Edelman Competition first began at Intel in 2009 with the introduction of its Master Production Scheduling solution utilizing operations research and optimization techniques. The initial solution was an enormous improvement over the existing manual, spreadsheet-based planning systems. However, the greatest value of the work was derived from the flexibility and agility of the team to continuously improve and transform Intel’s advanced analytics capabilities to stay in lockstep with our transformation as a technology company. No doubt, Intel’s technology innovations drive an ever-increasing complexity of our product architecture, manufacturing process, and supply chain. Today’s solution has evolved to incorporate advanced analytics to optimize global planning at Intel, across both product and manufacturing vectors. Our approach integrates the generation and optimization of product design alternatives (using genetic algorithms and device physics simulation) with large-scale supply chain planning (using problem decomposition and mixed-integer programming) to deliver more output within existing capacity. This corporate-wide capability is fast and effective, enabling analysis of many more business scenarios in much less time than previous solutions. The capability provides substantially faster response time to customers. These advanced analytics solutions set the direction on key product architecture design decisions across multiple products and business units and are vital to the improved supply chain planning decisions performed on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis across Intel’s worldwide manufacturing network. Intel also realized several organizational benefits. One is the enablement of personnel on the front lines of product design and supply chain planning to make faster, better, more integrated decisions. Another gives senior management new insights and abilities to influence decisions impacting go-to-market strategies. Finally, our success provides proof of the power of applying advanced analytics to Intel business problems for all teams inside Intel as well as across the advanced analytics community. Despite many challenges throughout the years, our users and our management have transitioned from skeptics to believers and, finally, to champions. Especially in the current market environment when the global semiconductor industry is experiencing very high demand and severe capacity constraints, our capability is fully leveraged, enabling Intel to maximize output to customers while minimizing costs. Intel is honored to be the 2020 Franz Edelman Award winner and proud of the featured work. This recognition is for the entire team working to deliver the solutions that drive the most important decisions for Intel. We also share this award with our mentors, coaches, and extended members of the Intel team who provided support and assistance throughout our Edelman journey to share our powerful story. We deeply appreciate INFORMS and the entire community of operations research and analytics professionals who are transforming the world. Intel is delighted to add the Edelman Award to its mantle beside the earned Wagner Prize and INFORMS Prize, thereby completing our INFORMS “trifecta.” Together, these awards demonstrate the power of advanced analytics at Intel, and its fundamental importance in our ability to deliver the technology leadership and reliable, top quality products the world needs and expects. 16 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 17 \n\n# OPERATIONS RESEARCH: BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF BENEFITS! \n\nBy Jeffrey M. Alden, General Motors Analytics Research \n\n# More than $336 billion U.S. dollars of impact! That’s impressive! How were they estimated? How broad is the impact? Is there more? Since 1974, Edelman Competition finalists publish their project accomplishments in the INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics . In reviewing the 289 articles, their cumulative monetary impact was estimated using the following guidelines: • Be objective and make conservative assumptions. • Include reported impact plus at most two more years of anticipated impact. • Include only one year of enormous impact (tens of billions) to downplay the huge size and budget of some organizations. • Ignore relative impact even though saving $10 million for a small company may be more impressive than saving $100 million for a large company. These conservative guidelines exclude important yet difficult-to-quantify reported benefits, such as improvements in legal dispute resolution, cancer treatments, airline safety, epidemic disease control, organizational structure, on-time railways, space shuttle heat shielding, and water quality. For example, there are more than 20 finalist papers with significant life and health benefits. Most are difficult to quantify, however, a CDC project on (future) U.S. epidemics expects annual savings of 6,000 lives valued at $12B 1 and one U.S. Army project estimates 4,500 avoided casualties by reducing requirements for helicopter and ground-convoy movements. 2\n\nNearly all finalist papers report nonmonetary benefits and tout them as longer lasting by establishing, for example, ongoing practices and organizational changes that improve health, safety, cooperation, decision making, timeliness, and job satisfaction. Reported monetary benefits understate the full impact of the Edelman finalist projects that are also saving lives and solving societal problems. Another important indication of the influence of operations research (O.R.) is the impressive breadth of applications. Edelman finalists represent 143 different application areas including aviation (safety, traffic), banking, canal operations, communications (broadband, broadcasting, radio spectrum), consumer products, crowd control, cruise lines, delivery (express, truck), defense (Air Force, Army), education, financial (contract bidding, credit card, fraud, investment, pension, settlement), fire protection, forestry, healthcare (blood collection, cancer, diagnosis, disease control, elderly, hospital, medical displays, pharmaceutical, surgery), hotel management, energy production and distribution (coal, gas, electric, nuclear, oil, wind), land use, manufacturing (electronics, food, paper, seeds, steel, tires, vehicles), marketing, mining, printing, sanitation, security (airport, police), senior housing, social networks, sports, tax collection, transportation (airline, highway, railway, rental, outer space, \n\nschool bus), treasure hunting, waste management, water (flood, flow, resources, quality), and weapons dismantlement. The list goes on and on! In fact, 742 organizations 3 from business, government, and academia are recognized and honored as supporting or benefiting from finalist projects. This is just the “tip of the iceberg” because the Edelman Competition only captures those O.R. professionals choosing to compete! The 1,405 Edelman finalist authors 4 represent only 10% of the current INFORMS membership. Undoubtedly, there is a vast number of projects with significant impact that did not compete due to confidentiality, lack of internal support to compete (e.g., no one thought of it, too busy, no management support, inadequate documentation), or the team was simply unaware of the competition. The impact is immense! O.R. professionals should be proud of their profession – you can say “hundreds of billions” when asked about the value of O.R.!  \n\n> 1\n\nFor CDC: 6,000 lives/year ≈ 314M U.S. population * 5% epidemic penetration * 10% die under current practices * (1%-80% fatality reduction under improved practices) * 1 epidemic per 200 years. Value of quality year of life in U.S. is $2M/average life ≈ $50K/ year (a standard value) * 78 years life expectancy * 50% average life lived. Total expected annual impact is $12B = 6,000 * $2M. See “Advancing Public Health and Medical Preparedness with Operations Research,” Interfaces , Vol. 43, No. 1 (note Figure 6). Numbers are reasonable values offered by the author.  \n\n> 2\n\n“Bayesian Networks for Combat Equipment Diagnostics,” Interfaces , Vol. 47, No. 1.  \n\n> 3\n\nSome organizations and contestants have competed multiple times and are counted more than once.  \n\n> 4\n\nInteresting how the average number of authors per paper has grown from 1.8 over first 10 award years (1974–1982) to 8.2 in the last 10 award years (2010–2019).

AND ANALYTICS \n\nThe Franz Edelman Award Competition is administered by the Practice Section of INFORMS \n\n# For almost 50 years, the international Franz Edelman Competition has shined a spotlight on the most outstanding real-world applications of operations research (O.R.) and analytics that are transforming our approach to some of the world’s most complex problems. Every year, organizations from around the world – both large and small, profit and nonprofit, business and governmental, private and public – compete for the Edelman Award. All selected finalists have realized substantial benefits that range from life-saving medical advancements to millions in cost savings and efficiency gains, all from the practical application of advanced methods of O.R. and analytics. Rich with insightful research, the abstracts from finalist papers are shared in INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics . In addition, full-text versions and video of the competition presentations are available online. The history of the Edelman Award predates that of INFORMS. In 1972, The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS), together with its College on the Practice of Management Science (CPMS), created the competition. In 1986, the award was renamed in honor of one of the earliest industry practitioners of O.R. in North America, Franz Edelman. When TIMS merged with the Operations Research Society of America in 1995 to create INFORMS, the Edelman Award became the flagship event in a growing awards program. Born in Germany not long before Hitler came to power, Franz Edelman overcame significant adversity at a young age. After fleeing the Nazi regime as a teenager in the late 1930s, Franz Edelman found himself in England, where his alien status resulted in internment, and an interlude of lumberjacking in Canada. After navigating these obstacles, he received his undergraduate education at McGill University, and later earned a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from Brown University. He then joined the RCA Corporation as an engineer concentrating on computational topics. Franz rapidly began to envision the extreme value of computer systems that could assist with management and business operations. By the early 1950s, this insight led him to establish RCA’s legendary Operations Research Group, one of the first in a North American corporation. As he continued in his advancement of the O.R. profession, Franz Edelman advocated that success in O.R. requires excellence in information technology (IT) – computer software, computer hardware, and communications. His passion for IT ultimately led him to his new role as vice president of Business Systems and Analysis for RCA, responsible for IT as well as O.R. These ideals are still very much present in our current focus on “analytics” and “business intelligence,” where strong analysis combines with strong IT. After 30 years of service to RCA, Franz Edelman retired and formed Edelman Associates, an O.R. consulting firm. Throughout his career, Franz’s commitment to advancing O.R. and his positive influence on others enhanced his legacy as a leader in the field of O.R. practice. Following his death, the Franz Edelman Award was named in his honor and continues to advance the O.R. practice to which he contributed so much. 20 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 21 \n\n# THE FINEST STEP FORWARD: JOURNEY TO THE FRANZ EDELMAN AWARD \n\n# Every year, the recipient of the Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Advanced Analytics, Operations Research, and Management Science is selected from a pool of incredibly accomplished finalist teams, representing leading organizations from around the world. The finalist projects are the result of years of research, hard work, and collaboration for a transformative impact for each organization. The selection process at INFORMS also begins long before the award is ever presented. After issuing a call for entries, INFORMS often receives more than two dozen submissions from organizations with a summary illustrating a practical operations research (O.R.) application in which the results had significant, verifiable, and quantifiable impact for the organization. The Franz Edelman Award Committee is comprised of nearly three dozen O.R. practitioners and academics from leading O.R. programs, including IBM, SAS, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Boeing, General Electric, UPS, Duke University, Virginia Tech, and more. By November of each year, this committee will have narrowed the applicant field to a group of semifinalists, and by the end of each year, six are recognized as Edelman Award finalists. Prior to being named finalists, each entry is carefully reviewed by a team of verifiers who work with the relevant stakeholders to validate the details of each award entry. The verifiers thoroughly examine the O.R. work presented in the assigned entry summary, as well as its potential impact, and convey this information to the rest of the selection committee. The verifiers communicate directly with the entrant’s O.R. team, the users of the work, and client management. Verification is a crucial step in the competition as it ensures that only the highest-quality O.R. will be represented in the Edelman Award Competition. All verifiers follow detailed written guidelines and sample verification reports to ensure a thorough process that is identical for each award entry. Once the Edelman Award Committee has announced the six entries that will advance to the finals, each finalist prepares a journal-quality paper and a 40-minute presentation that will be held during the INFORMS Conference on Business Analytics and Operations Research (held virtually in 2020 and 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic). A team of experienced coaches is assigned to each finalist team to guide them throughout each step of the process, and help ensure that the team’s paper and presentation will convey the significance and monumental impact of the work to the panel of judges. As the INFORMS Conference on Business Analytics and Operations Research approaches, the finalist teams prepare for the final stage of the competition. The finalist papers are presented to the judges, who then begin the long review process. Each judge independently studies the papers and provides input to a group discussion. The finalists are assigned a focal point judge who conveys valuable \n\nfeedback from the judging committee to the finalist coaches. This feedback helps each team identify areas with potential for clarification or improvement prior to the final presentation, which takes place on the second day of the INFORMS Business Analytics Conference. On the day of the competition, each team conducts a 40-minute presentation, followed by a 10-minute period of questioning by the judges. This year’s presentations were conducted virtually, as was the judging. As they assess each presentation, the judges follow a strict set of guidelines, including the importance of the application, the novelty and portability of the technical solution, the quality and effectiveness of the implementation, and the total impact of the project in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Once the final presentation is complete, the judges carefully review all that they have heard and seen, until they unanimously agree on which finalist team best exemplifies the ideals and standards of the Franz Edelman Award and its legacy that represents almost 50 years of O.R. and analytics excellence. Following the competition, the incredible achievements of all the finalists are showcased in the January/ February issue of the INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics , which is dedicated to improving the practical application of O.R. to decisions and policies in today’s organizations and industries. In addition to being presented virtually at this year’s conference, the competition is recorded and all presentations are made available via streaming video shortly after the end of the INFORMS Business Analytics Conference. During the INFORMS Annual Meeting in the fall, which attracts more than 7,000 O.R. and analytics professionals, academics, and students from around the world, the first-place team shares a keynote address, while the other finalists will again be invited to reprise their work to share during a meeting session. 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 23 \n\n# EDELMAN FIRST-PLACE AWARD RECIPIENTS \n\n2020 Intel Corporation \n\n“Intel Realizes $25 Billion by Applying Advanced Analytics from Product Architecture Design through Supply Chain Planning” \n\n2019 Louisville Metropolitan Sewer District \n\n“Analytics & Optimization Reduce Sewage Overflows to Protect Community Waterways in Kentucky” \n\n2018 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) \n\n“Unlocking the Beachfront Using Operations Research to Repurpose Wireless Spectrum” \n\n2017 Holiday Retirement \n\n“Revenue Managemen Provides Double Digit Revenue Lift for Holiday Retirement” \n\n2016 UPS \n\n“UPS On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation (ORION) Project” \n\n2015 Syngenta \n\n“Good Growth through Advanced Analytics” \n\n2014 U.S. Centers for Disease Control \n\n“Eradicating Polio Using Better Decision Models” \n\n2013 Delta Programme Commissioner \n\n“Economically Efficient Flood Standards to Protect the Netherlands Against Flooding” \n\n2012 TNT Express \n\n“Supply Chain-Wide Optimization at TNT Express” \n\n2011 MISO \n\n“MISO Applies Operations Research to Energy Ancillary Services Markets, Unlocking Billions in Savings” \n\n2010 Indeval \n\n“Mexican Financial Markets Benefit from Novel Application of Operations Research” \n\n2009 Hewlett-Packard \n\n“HP Transforms Product Portfolio Management with Operations Research” \n\n2008 Netherlands Railways \n\n“The New Dutch Timetable: The O.R.

One of these organizations will be recognized as the best in class, the first-place recipient of the 2021 Franz Edelman Award for their work to help save lives, save money, and solve problems. A shortened summary of each of the 2021 finalist team’s work is described in the following pages. Papers including the full project description will be published in the January/February 2022 issue of INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics \n\n(formerly Interfaces ). This journal, published by INFORMS, is dedicated to improving the practical application of operations research and advanced analytics in today’s organizations and industries. \n\nThe finalists for the 2021 Edelman Award \n\ninclude the following: \n\n• Alibaba \n\n• JD.com \n\n• Lenovo \n\n• Memorial Sloan Kettering \n\n• OCP \n\n• The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 33 \n\n# ALIBABA \n\nAlibaba VRP Algorithms Have Enabled Its On-time Hour-level Delivery \n\n# In recent years, Alibaba has pioneered an integrated online and offline retailer where customers can place online orders of e-commerce and grocery products at its participating stores or restaurants and have them delivered in as short as 30 minutes or 2-4 hours. Depending on the customer segments and geographical locations, these services are provided through various businesses of Alibaba ecosystem, such as Freshippo, Taoxianda, Cainiao Network, Lazada, etc. The delivery services enable their customers to order nearly everything, including fresh foods, raw or cooked, and OTC drugs on their mobile phones. These service commitments indicate that as soon as orders are placed, decisions have to be made to 1) batch these orders and schedule picking routes of orders for pickers at warehouses or stores, and 2) optimize routes for motor drivers. There are varieties of routing 34 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD \n\nproblems to be solved in the whole process or order fulfillment process. The stringent service commitment, coupled with urban transportation uncertainty and complicated picking operations in space-tight warehouses, have created significant challenges in developing solutions to these problems. To solve these problems, the operations research community of Alibaba has developed its own vehicle routing problem (VRP) system. In addition to the reduced time and the resulting cost-saving benefits, the algorithm has brought several other intangible benefits. It significantly frees up the time of algorithm developers, speeds up the business development, and becomes one of the key drivers behind the success of several business subsidiaries inside Alibaba — providing on-time and fast delivery service in a cost-efficient way is critical to stay competitive in the market, and by shortening the vehicles’ traveling route, the carbon dioxide emissions are reduced, another effort highlighting our commitment to environment protection. The system is built upon two approaches: an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) Framework and a Learning-based Framework. The former is based on the latest metaheuristics in the solution of VRPs, contains a rich pool of neighborhood search operators, supports almost all variants of VRPs, and allows the inclusion of additional objectives and constraints for expansion, and has consistently ranked the best among several VRP test cases. The latter is the development of a deep-learning-based approach that trains neural network models offline to make almost instant online predictions of optimal solutions. \n\nThe algorithms have achieved near the vicinity of the best solutions for some VRP cases with a tiny fraction of the time and thus are used for practical online decision making. To increase the transportability of the system, several efforts were made: First, a framework that allows extension through neighborhood operators is developed. An extendable domain-specific language is designed to implement user-defined constraints and objectives. Second, a data-driven approach that allows self-learning VRP solutions based on real data is provided. It also incorporates optimization to generate offline training to derive models that could be used for online real-time decision making. Such an approach has been applied to develop the solution to address a variety of routing problems in milliseconds in real life. \n\nORGANIZATION \n\nAlibaba \n\nFounded in 1999, Alibaba enables businesses to transform the way they market, sell, and operate and improve their efficiencies. We provide the technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help merchants, brands, and other businesses to leverage the power of new technology to engage with their users and customers and operate in a more efficient way. Our businesses are comprised of core commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment, and innovation initiatives. An ecosystem has developed around our platforms and businesses that consists of consumers, merchants, brands, retailers, third-party service providers, strategic alliance partners, and other businesses. 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 37 \n\n# JD.COM \n\nOperations Research Optimization Algorithms Drive Unmanned Warehouse Robots to Work \n\n# JD.com pioneered same-day delivery as a standard service in China’s B2C e-commerce sector 10 years ago. As both demand and labor costs have increased dramatically since then, the company has faced an emerging challenge of how to cost-effectively meet growing demands while maintaining high-quality logistics services. In response, JD.com began to invest in unmanned warehouses in 2015. One of the major challenges in an unmanned warehouse is the management and dispatching of automatic guided vehicles (AGVs). In a modern parts-to-picker automated warehouse system, AGVs pick up movable racks and transport inventory to workstations for picking. A central question is how to effectively dispatch AGVs to racks and workstations in real time, to minimize the travel-distance and order-fulfillment time. The problem can be formulated as a large-scale integer program with millions 38 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD \n\nof decision variables and constraints. Moreover, it must be solved in real time. We tackle this problem via a Lagrangian relaxation together with cutting planes, and are able to find near-optimal dispatching decisions for hundreds of AGVs in seconds. Optimization combined with modern robotics technology results in tremendous improvements in picking efficiency and warehouse space utilization. JD.com currently operates more than 900 warehouses with an area of approximately 21 million square meters. JD.com’s application of unmanned technologies is the most extensive in the field of e-commerce logistics in China. It has helped the company to lower the inventory turnover days to 33.3 despite the significant increase in the number of SKUs, and decrease fulfillment expense ratio to a world-leading level of 6.5%. In 2020, 90% of JD.com’s first-party retail orders were delivered the same- or next-day after they were placed. The agility of such unmanned technologies not only makes it possible for a single warehouse to handle more than 1.3 million orders per day during peak sales seasons, but also helped the company quickly respond to COVID-19 and ensure the rapid recovery of production capabilities. Moreover, before the deployment of unmanned warehouses, logistics workers across the industry had faced unprecedented pressure in the form of physical labor. For example, warehouse employees often manage heavy loads, causing serious joint problems; pickers walk the length of almost a marathon each day and workers in cold chain warehouses frequently transition between normal temperatures and -30°C. The unmanned warehouse technology has effectively improved working conditions. JD.com began providing integrated technology services including both software and automation \n\nsolutions to third parties in 2018. This opening up has demonstrated extraordinary results across industries such as FMCG, apparel, home appliances, home furniture, consumer electronics, automotive, and fresh produce. In 2020, JD.com’s logistics business served more than 190,000 corporate customers. JD.com’s unmanned warehouse technology has received intense media coverage since its deployment. It was featured on the April 21, 2018, broadcast of China Central Television’s nightly news program Xinwen Lianbo. This program is shown simultaneously by all local TV stations in mainland China, making it one of the world’s most-watched programs. The warehouse has also been covered by leading international media outlets including CNBC, Bloomberg ,\n\nThe Washington Post , and others. Furthermore, as a representative of contemporary Chinese science and technology, JD.com was also featured during the closing ceremony of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics in an 8-minute promotional video for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will be held in Beijing. \n\nORGANIZATIONS \n\nJD.com \n\nJD.com is a leading technology-driven e-commerce company transforming to become the leading supply chain-based technology and service provider. The company’s cutting-edge retail infrastructure seeks to enable consumers to buy whatever they want, whenever and wherever they want it. The company has opened its technology and infrastructure to partners, brands, and other sectors, as part of its Retail as a Service offering to help drive productivity and innovation across a range of industries. JD.com is the largest retailer in China, a member of the NASDAQ100, and a Fortune Global 500 company. \n\nThe Shanghai University of Finance and Economics \n\nThe Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) is a top-ranked, world-renowned finance- and economics-oriented research university located in Shanghai, the People’s Republic of China. As the oldest financial university in China, SUFE has enjoyed a reputation of being one of the best finance and economics universities in China for many years. \n\nThe University of Chicago Booth School of Business \n\nThe University of Chicago Booth School of Business is the graduate business school of the University of Chicago. Founded in 1898, Chicago Booth is the second-oldest business school in the U.S. and is associated with nine Nobel laureates in the Economic Sciences. Chicago Booth empowers bold thinkers and inquisitive minds to dig deeper, discover more, and shape the future. \n\nThe University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering \n\nThe University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering was founded in 1905.

Lenovo consistently strives to provide the highest quality and best experiences to all of its customers, which include end consumer, commercial, and small-to medium-sized businesses. Each year, Lenovo provides global users with hundreds of millions of smart devices, including PCs, tablets, and smartphones. Lenovo accomplishes this intelligent transformation through technological innovations, not only in designing and building smart devices and infrastructures, but also in the daily operation and management of its massive supply chain and manufacturing system. Hefei Electronics Technology (LCFC), a subsidiary of Lenovo, produced more than 34 million PCs in 2020, accounting for nearly half 42 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 43 \n\nof Lenovo’s PC production. Due to the large scale and complex production system at LCFC, production scheduling is a critical process to optimize manufacturing efficiency and throughput. The primary task for the planning team in LCFC is taking batches of orders twice a day and making corresponding production schedules for the manufacturing plants through long hours of intensive communication and coordination. Job orders are assigned to each production line with the intent to fully utilize the capacity of each machine. Below is an overview of the challenging demands associated with the manufacturing scheduling process: • LCFC has four plants, containing 43 assembly lines in total. • For each run of production scheduling, more than 6,000 production orders need to be scheduled, involving more than 200,000 laptops waiting for production. • The products are categorized into more than 550 models with over 250,000 stock keeping units (SKUs). • A task corresponding to a specific model can only be executed on a portion of the total production line set. • Orders with an urgent due date need to be scheduled preferentially to reduce the chance of a violation, which directly impacts the customer fulfillment rate and cost of manufacturing. In order to improve performance of production scheduling, reduce the workload of the planning team, and respond to the scheduling demand more quickly, the Lenovo Research team and LCFC jointly developed an advanced production \n\nscheduling solution. Utilizing machine learning, artificial intelligence, and reinforcement learning, production scheduling in LCFC was modeled as a very large-scale combinatorial optimization problem with massive operational constraints. A deep reinforcement machine learning model based on an encoder-decoder architecture was used with improved representation ability added by using a multilayer forward convolution into the encoder and a masking mechanism that enforces the operational constraints to the output of the model. Through powerful self-learning and computing capabilities, the solution improved multiple production indicators and obtained complete scheduling results within minutes instead of the hours it previously took. The new solution has significantly increased the production efficiency of LCFC, reformed the management process to reduce the backlog of production orders, and improved fulfillment rate, which has led to higher profitability and a better customer experience. Since 2019, this solution helped Lenovo increase revenue by more than 4.6 billion USD in total. Moreover, the analytics and operations research techniques in this project are not limited to just the production scheduling problem. This work is highly portable to other industrial planning and decision scenarios inside or outside of Lenovo, such as delivery routing and packing optimization, material requirements planning, and supply chain optimization. \n\nORGANIZATIONS \n\nLenovo Group \n\nLenovo is a Fortune Global 500 company with more than 50 billion USD in revenue and 63,000 employees, operating in 180 markets around the world. Focused on a bold vision to deliver smarter technology for all, Lenovo is developing world-changing technologies that create a more inclusive, trustworthy, and sustainable digital society. By designing, engineering, and building the world’s most complete portfolio of smart devices and infrastructure, Lenovo is also leading an Intelligent Transformation – to create better experiences and opportunities for millions of customers around the world. \n\nLCFC (Hefei) Electronics Technology (LCFC) \n\nFounded in 2011, LCFC is Lenovo’s subsidiary and the largest PC research, development, and manufacturing base plant. In 2020, LCFC realized total revenue of 14.38 billion USD with peak production over 190,000 units per day. For every eight new laptops sold worldwide, one of those comes from LCFC. So far, more than 150 million products have been shipped from LCFC cumulatively. 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 45 \n\n# MEMORIAL SLOAN KETTERING \n\nAutomated and Clinically Optimal Radiotherapy Cancer Treatment Planning \n\n# Planning cancer treatments with radiation to sterilize cancer cells is a global problem. Every year, worldwide, there are about 18 million new cases of cancer, more than a third of which are treated with radiation. Radiotherapy is the use of carefully chosen beams of high-energy radiation to sterilize cancer and is often given in conjunction with other types of treatment such as chemotherapy and/or surgery. The radiation is delivered directly into the affected area to kill cancerous cells without harming the surrounding healthy organs and tissue. The treatment is complex and very patient specific; it must be uniquely tailored for each patient. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) has developed and applied advanced optimization tools (e.g., hierarchical constrained optimization, convex approximation, Lagrangian 46 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 47 \n\nmultipliers), along with careful modeling of the radiation delivery process, to provide better planning, faster, and cheaper radiotherapy treatment. The need for complex, high-dimensional constrained optimization in cancer care is clear, because each cancer patient is unique in terms of the shape and location of the tumor and radiation-sensitive surrounding healthy tissues. Radiation is delivered to the patient’s body from various orientations. Each \"intensity modulated\" radiation treatment requires customization of radiation intensity maps of delivered beams to kill cancerous cells without causing excessive harm to nearby normal organs and tissues. Finding these patient-specific settings, correctly prioritizing different dose goals to disease, and achieving the desired avoidance to multiple normal tissues, is a complex and labor-intensive task that must be achieved in a limited time. Most current planning optimization methods either rely on the radiotherapy planners’ experience and skill to guide these tradeoffs or seek to create a plan based on characteristics of past acceptable plans. \n\nThe Approach \n\nMSKCC formulated this problem as a hierarchical constrained optimization problem to better capture the underlying clinical philosophy of controlling acceptable dose tradeoffs within the plan: some dose goals are more important than other goals. For example, delivering adequate tumoricidal dose to mouth cancer may be considered more important than avoiding a reduction in salivary function. For each patient, the delivery machine parameters are optimized by solving two large-scale sequential constrained optimization problems. The first-level optimization problem guarantees adequate radiation dose to the tumor; the second-level optimization problem minimizes the radiation to critical healthy organs. Excessive radiation dose to healthy organs exceeding tissue tolerances is strictly prohibited in each optimization problem using constraints. The resultant optimization problems are large and nonconvex with hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints. To allow quick patient access and solve the optimization problems in a clinically reasonable time frame, the team leveraged multiple advanced optimization tools (e.g., convex approximation, Lagrangian multipliers, and sequential convex programming) to reduce typical computational time to 1-2 hours while also maximizing patient plan quality. \n\nClinical Implementation \n\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has clinically implemented this complex optimization technique, internally referred to as ECHO (Expedited Constrained Hierarchical Optimization). The technique was validated before clinical implementation, with extensive retrospective comparison studies comparing automated ECHO plans with the manually generated plans produced by experienced planners. Extensive work was also done to improve the dosimetric modeling, ensuring that the optimization problem solution is close to the dose distribution as delivered by the treatment machine. The team demonstrated that ECHO plans have a consistent high quality, and in general provide better tumor irradiation, and reduced radiation dose to the key healthy organs, and are thus expected to improve outcomes. In addition, ECHO results in improved clinical workflow and shorter times between simulation and treatment (from 5 days to 4 days). More than 3,000 patients have benefited thus far from ECHO radiotherapy treatments. Benefits \n\nto MSKCC and their patients include: 1) a streamlined and more efficient workflow (e.g., increased capacity); 2) reduced planning effort; 3) improved plan quality; 4) greater planning consistency; and 5) expedited treatments for numerous patients in severe pain and in urgent need of treatment. The ECHO system has been commissioned clinically for several disease sites (prostate, lung, paraspinal, oligometastatic, and head and neck), and will be expanded to the great majority of all radiotherapy treatment planning at MSKCC in the next two years. The ECHO system will ultimately be explored as a way to impact patient care more broadly, most likely with a commercial partner, including in resource-constrained countries where access to highly skilled radiotherapy planners is very limited and cost-efficient resource utilization is a must to be able to meet the cancer treatment need. \n\nORGANIZATION \n\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \n\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), located in New York City and the surrounding region, is the largest and oldest private cancer center in the world. MSKCC is regarded as one of the world’s leading cancer centers delivering patient care, conducting research, and training the next generation of cancer caregivers and researchers. MSKCC annually treats more than 12,000 patients with radiotherapy. Each year MSKCC trains more than 3,000 medical students, residents, postdoctoral researchers, PhD and MD-PhD candidates. According to U.S. News & World Report , MSKCC has ranked as one of the top two hospitals for cancer care in the country for more than 30 years. 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 49 \n\n# OCP \n\nGlobal Food Security: Transforming OCP through Analytics \n\n# Humanity relies on cultivated lands to feed itself and thrive. Fertilizers are responsible for 30%-50% of food production and phosphate is an essential and non-substitutable component of fertilizers. OCP, based in Northern Africa, is the world’s largest phosphate mining and processing company with a worldwide reach and a diversified product portfolio, and therefore plays a critical role in global food security. Its supply chain is large and complex, and running it involves many key decisions along the value chain. OCP extracts about 40 million tons of rock per year from more than eight mining sites, with each site delivering up to 10 different grades of raw ore. These different grades may undergo physical processing and blending before either being exported or further processed into nine grades of phosphoric acid or over 43 grades of fertilizers in more than 42 plants in multiple geographies. Managing such a complex supply chain is challenging due to the large number of decision 50 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 51 \n\nvariables pertaining to extraction planning, rock beneficiation, blending, and chemical processing allocation. All of these operational decisions need to be adjusted to the sales opportunities that arise globally. Over the last decade, OCP in collaboration with Dynamic Ideas, an analytics consulting company based in Massachusetts, developed a mixed-integer, multiperiod optimization model to holistically optimize the entire production, sales, and supply chain of OCP: from the mines, to physical treatments, to chemical facilities, to inventory facilities and the port for global distribution. This model brings together all major operational decisions of the company into the same decision platform, enabling all managers to collaborate in order to maximize the overall profit. It currently runs at different time horizons, ad hoc, monthly, quarterly, annually and multi-annually depending on the nature of decisions to be made. The development of the model has been used to transform the processes of the company toward more cooperation, transparency, and alignment on common objectives. It contributed significantly to breaking the silos within the organization, educating managers on the interdependency of their actions, and materially affected the culture of the company to promote innovation collaboration and entrepreneurship. In turn, this led to the development of a new university (UMP6) in Morocco in 2017, in which analytics play a central role, and a very successful executive education class at MIT. The optimization model is responsible for an EBITDA improvement year-on-year in excess of 20%, amounting to more than $2.3 billion for the period 2015-2020. (EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and is a metric used to evaluate a company’s operating performance. \n\nIt can be seen as a proxy for cash flow from the entire company’s operations.) The incremental profitability has fueled OCP’s financing capacity. OCP is consequently delivering a $20 billion in capital expenditures (CAPEX) program. The first phase of the CAPEX program led to doubling OCP’s mining capacity and tripling fertilizer production capacity, resulting in OCP bringing an additional 8 million tons of fertilizers production capacity in the last decade. The model further enabled OCP to produce customized fertilizers that helped achieve materially improved agricultural yields, hence food production, especially in Africa. The increased production of fertilizers and availability of customized fertilizers have significantly contributed toward global food security. \n\nORGANIZATIONS \n\nOCP \n\nThe OCP Group (formerly Office Chérifien des Phosphates) is a Moroccan-based phosphate rock miner, phosphoric acid manufacturer, and phosphate fertilizer producer and exporter. Founded in 1920, the company has grown into the largest phosphate mining and processing company in the world and is responsible for 31% of phosphates global trade, an element that is key to global food security as it is an essential and non-substitutable component of fertilizers. OCP has access to more than 70% of the world’s phosphate rock reserves. The group employs nearly 20,000 people in Morocco and a number of international subsidiaries. In 2018, its revenues amounted to $6 billion, which represented 5% of the GDP (gross domestic product) of Morocco. In 2006, OCP was in such financial distress that it was seeking massive cash injection just to survive. OCP was holding a $3.8 billion long-term liability and had achieved mostly negative net income since 1999. The company was focused on maximizing the volume of rock extracted, which produced poor financial performance and limited its growth capacity to address growing food demand. A new team led by Dr. Mostafa Terrab, chairman and CEO, took leadership of the company in 2006 with the mandate to change the strategy, address the financial situation of the organization, change the operating processes, deal with internal politics, and more importantly transform the culture of the organization. OCP is unrecognizable today. The company is now highly profitable ($2 billion EBITDA in 2020 while prices of fertilizers were near the bottom of the price cycle), its culture is oriented toward serving its end-customers while optimizing value-leveraging sales and strong operations departments collaboratively. \n\nDynamic Ideas \n\nDynamic Ideas is a Massachusetts-based analytics consulting company founded in 1999. Several of the senior members of the Dynamic Ideas team were trained in operations research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company has extensive expertise in optimization and analytics. Its clientele includes several major global companies including OCP. 52 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 53 \n\n# UNITED NATIONS WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME \n\nToward Zero Hunger with Analytics \n\n# Today, nearly 690 million people regularly go to bed hungry. This means 1 in 11 people do not have access to enough food – a situation exacerbated further by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. One of the key players addressing this issue is the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the world’s largest humanitarian organization fighting hunger worldwide and winner of the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. In 2019, WFP procured and distributed 4.2 million metric tons of food and provided U.S. $2.1 billion in cash-based transfers to 97.1 million beneficiaries across 88 countries. Humanitarian operations are complex to manage by nature, as they seek to address multifaceted problems with limited resources in unstable operational environments. Planning and managing the entire supply chain of WFP assistance comes with many unique challenges: from high demand volatility to funding restrictions and from security 54 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 55 \n\nand access limitations to data inconsistencies. As needs evolve and new information comes in, it is critical to continually monitor and understand each operation, quickly adapt and re-evaluate plans, optimize the use of limited resources, and anticipate what is expected to happen next. To that end, WFP has been embracing the power of analytics. Engineers and mathematicians have taken a leading role in supporting complex operations, using analytics as an enabler to strengthen the integration between functional areas, augment visibility on WFP operations, and find concrete ways to maximize their efficiency and effectiveness. Working closely with its partners in academia (Tilburg University and Georgia Institute of Technology) and the private sector (Palantir, UPS, and Takeda), WFP has been developing a variety of tools ranging from automated dashboards (bringing together descriptive and predictive analytics) to decision support systems (such as control towers and optimization models). This coordinated, proactive, and data-driven approach to managing humanitarian operations has resulted in a wide range of benefits. In South Sudan, this approach has been used to optimize food arrivals through international corridors (Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda) and redesign the logistics network, improving access to hard-to-reach locations and reducing the need for costly airdrops. This has resulted in better utilization of the riverine network, earlier availability of donor funding, and more than U.S. $100 million in savings. Moreover, this approach led to the reopening of a barge supply line between Sudan and South Sudan for the first time since 2011, contributing to peace-building activities and economic development across the region. In Iraq, analytics helped identify more cost-effective food baskets. Simultaneously optimizing the composition of the ration and the supply chain strategy reduced monthly operational costs by 12% without compromising the nutritional performance of the basket. This optimized ration was distributed for more than two years, resulting in more than U.S. $25 million in savings. For the COVID-19 response, analytics supported senior management in decision making for global operations, evaluating contingency scenarios and prioritizing scarce resources such as funds, staff, and key commodities. Additionally, a Control Tower was built to support WFP’s Common Services, which allow other organizations and partners to leverage WFP’s supply chain network to move life-saving health cargo anywhere in the world. This allowed for the transportation of 100,000 m³ (cubic meters) of cargo to more \n\nthan 150 countries during a period of extensive lockdowns and access constraints. Significant investments over the last decade have put planning and optimization at the forefront of tackling emergencies at WFP. A data-driven approach to managing operations has gradually become the norm and has culminated in the creation of a supply chain planning unit and more than U.S. $150 million in savings – enough to support two million food insecure people for an entire year. The developed tools provide end-to-end decision support for each WFP operation, making it possible to rapidly identify the most efficient and effective course of action. Through analytics, decision makers are now equipped with the insights they need to manage their operation in the best way, thereby saving and changing the lives of millions and bringing the world one step closer to “Zero Hunger.” \n\nORGANIZATIONS \n\nU.N. World Food Programme \n\nThe U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) is a frontline humanitarian organization saving lives and changing lives, delivering food assistance in emergencies, and working with communities to improve nutrition and build resilience. For its efforts to combat hunger, contribute to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict, WFP was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020. On any given day, WFP has 5,600 trucks, 30 ships, and nearly 100 planes on the move, delivering food and other life-saving assistance to those in most need. Every year, it distributes more than 15 billion rations at an estimated average cost per ration of U.S. $0.61. These numbers lie at the roots of WFP’s unparalleled reputation as an emergency responder, one that gets the job done quickly at scale in the most difficult environments. In 2019, WFP assisted 97 million people in 88 countries. Two-thirds of WFP’s work is in conflict-affected countries where people are three times more likely to be undernourished than those living in countries without conflict. In emergencies, WFP is often first on the scene, providing food assistance to the victims of war, civil conflict, drought, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, crop failures, and natural disasters. When the emergency subsides, WFP helps communities rebuild shattered lives and livelihoods. In addition, WFP works to strengthen the resilience of people and communities affected by protracted crises by applying a development lens in its humanitarian response. 56 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 57 \n\n# THE THE \n\n# WAGNER WAGNER \n\n# PRIZE PRIZE \n\n# DANIEL H. WAGNER PRIZE HISTORY \n\nFor Excellence in the Practice of Advanced Analytics & Operations Research \n\n# The Wagner Prize is awarded annually in honor of the late Dr. Daniel H. Wagner. During his years as president and principal owner of Daniel H. Wagner Associates, Dr. Wagner brought many high-quality mathematicians into the operations research community. This led to significant advances in the firm’s fields of endeavor and delivery of significant applications to the Navy, Coast Guard, and other clients. Many of the applications are still in service today. Dr. Wagner earned his PhD in mathematics from Brown University in 1951. His dissertation, “On Free Products of Groups,” was published in 1957 in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society . Dr. Wagner joined the Navy’s Operations Evaluation Group at the Pentagon, working on operations research for naval warfare. He worked there until 1956, with a one-year leave of absence for postdoctoral research on free algebras at MIT. Dr. Wagner then joined the Burroughs Research Center, where he directed a group of mathematicians performing analysis for the development of digital computers. In 1957, Dr. Wagner and John D. Kettelle formed the partnership of Kettelle and Wagner, which was dissolved in 1963. That same year, he formed a new company, Daniel H. Wagner Associates, Inc. This company applied itself to cutting-edge work in the mathematics of naval tactics, especially antisubmarine warfare, detection theory, and search planning. After retirement from the firm he founded, Dr. Wagner held various teaching and research positions with the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and the U.S. Naval Academy. Dr. Daniel H. Wagner was a member of INFORMS/ORSA for more than 40 years. He passed away in March 1997. \n\n2020 Wagner Prize Committee (* Nonvoting Member )\n\n• Mary Helander, Chair, Wagner Prize; Syracuse University \n\n• Margret Bjarnadottir, University of Maryland \n\n• William J.

Gutierrez, The University of Texas at Austin  \n\n> •\n\nMahesh Nagarajan, University of British Columbia \n\nThe award winning paper, “Theory-driven Practical Approach to Integrate R&D and Production Planning for Portfolio Management in Agribusiness,” describes agribusiness firms with an eye toward increasing population and evolving weather patterns, investing heavily into developing new varieties of staple crops that can provide higher yields and are robust to weather fluctuations. The team worked with Dow Agrosciences (now Corteva) over a period of five years to manage its seed corn portfolio, which includes several hundred seeds that cater to specific regions in the continental U.S. and is valued at more than $1 billion. The effort had two interacting parts: (1) developing a decision analytic theory to estimate the production yield distributions for new seed varieties from discrete quantile judgments provided by plant biology experts, and (2) developing an optimization protocol to determine Dow’s annual production plan for the seed portfolio with a flexibility of backup production in South America, under production yield and demand uncertainty. The first part was needed due to the sparsity of the yield data available during the research and development (R&D) process for new seeds. It was owned by the R&D function at the firm and provided yield probability distributions as inputs to the optimization protocol of the second part, which was owned by the production function. This optimization protocol navigated several hundred uncertainties in yields and demands for the seeds in the portfolio to determine the area that Dow should use in North America and South America for growing each seed. The results of the optimization problem informed the R&D function about the attractiveness of specific future varieties and helped structure its research pipeline. The team developed new theoretical results for both parts that were also easy to implement in the industrial environment at Dow. The implementation of the developed theory led to significant monetary and managerial benefits at Dow and underscores the importance of human elements of decision making at firms. 60 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 61 62 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 63 \n\n# UP SUPS \n\n# GEO RGE GEORGE \n\n# D. SMITH D. SMITH \n\n# PRI ZE PRIZE \n\n# UPS GEORGE D. SMITH PRIZE HISTORY \n\n# The UPS George D. Smith Prize is awarded to an academic department or program for effective and innovative preparation of students to be good practitioners of operations research, management science, or analytics. It is accompanied by a $10,000 cash award. The prize committee is pleased to announce the 2021 finalists: • Gies College of Business, \n\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign \n\n• Department of Information & Decision Sciences at the Carlson School of Management, \n\nUniversity of Minnesota \n\n• Department of Business Analytics, \n\nUniversity of Iowa \n\nThe UPS George D. Smith Prize is an exciting award created in the spirit of strengthening ties between industry and the schools of higher education that graduate young practitioners of operations research (O.R.). This prize has been named in honor of the late UPS chief executive officer who was a patron of operations researchers at the leading Fortune 500 corporation. George D. Smith was the second CEO of UPS, holding the position from 1962 to 1972. He joined UPS as an accountant in 1925 and at some point in his long and illustrious career held almost every functional title within the company. While his background was steeped in finance, George Smith had a keen engineering mind. In the late 1940s, after learning about O.R., Smith realized that intuition alone would not be enough to help UPS master the many issues it faced as it grew in size from a regional to nationwide carrier. Smith recognized O.R. as an engineering approach to making decisions, and started advocating the use of O.R. concepts at UPS. Quantitative analysis became the bedrock on which the UPS engineering function was built. Because of Smith’s vision, UPS now employs thousands of engineers whose focus is efficiency, sustainability, and service. He was a strong believer in investing in our younger generation. For him, nurturing them was the key to sustained prosperity. This prize embodies Smith’s beliefs: to recognize the importance of O.R. in practice, and ensure that members of our younger generation get proper exposure to its value, and in turn benefit society. \n\n2021 UPS Smith Prize Committee \n\n• Robert Dell, Chair, Smith Prize; Naval Postgraduate School \n\n• Andrew Armacost, University of North Dakota \n\n• Jill Hardin Wilson, Northwestern University \n\n• Patricia Randall, Princeton Consultants \n\n• Anne Robinson, Kinaxis \n\n• Andrew Wasser, Carnegie Mellon University \n\n• Haining Yu, Amazon 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 65 \n\n# 2021 SMITH PRIZE COMPETITION \n\n# Since the earliest days of operations research (O.R.) and analytics, to support the developing technology and research, it became increasingly important to prepare young O.R. and analytics professionals to further the growing impact of these fields. The UPS George D. Smith Prize recognizes the importance of a strong partnership between industry and academia in preparing students to be effective practitioners. The diversity, quality, and innovation of this year’s finalists presented the committee with an encouraging and exciting glimpse of the future of the profession. “As we grow in size, our problems increase geometrically.

And they are complete, with all supporting references and endorsements included. \n\n# 2021 INFORMS PRIZE WINNER \n\n# The 2021 INFORMS Prize for Sustained Integration of Operations Research first place winner is Amazon. Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus; passion for invention; commitment to operational excellence; and long-term thinking. Some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon include: customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa. From the beginning, operations research (O.R.) and analytics have been critical to Amazon’s success: Initial mathematical modeling initiatives focused on topology, the location of fulfillment centers (FCs) and improving the throughput of these facilities. As the number of FCs increased, Amazon focused its analytical horsepower on how to optimize the storage of inventory within the FCs, distribute inventory throughout the fulfillment network, optimize labor for all seasons, and how to “pick” more effectively. The introduction of new business initiatives such as robotics, web services, retail and physical stores has opened new avenues for the application of optimization, machine learning, and analytics to increase efficiency across all aspects of the business including the design and operation of one of the world’s largest delivery networks. Today, the middle mile ground and air transportation network represents one of the fastest growing logistics areas within Amazon. The ground network moves tens of millions of packages a week worldwide, operating hundreds of thousands of truckloads and thousands of air cargo flights each week. The scale and combinatorial nature of the delivery operation challenges Amazon to design, build, and operate robust transportation networks that minimize the overall operational cost while meeting customer promises and providing a good experience for Amazon employees. The Middle-Mile Planning, Research, and Optimization Sciences (mmPROS) team is central to this goal and charged with developing an evolving innovative suite of decision support and optimization tools to facilitate the design of efficient air and ground transport networks, optimize the flow of packages within the network to efficiently align network capacity and shipment demand, and effectively utilize scarce resources, such as aircraft, trucks, and rail services. The innovative tools developed to design and operate these networks rely heavily on mathematical optimization models and algorithms, machine learning, stochastic modeling and simulation, metaheuristics, and advanced analytics. Focus areas include surface research science, air science and tech, and pricing and yield management. These cutting-edge models and algorithms have helped to significantly reduce air and ground shipping costs while completely changing how carriers discover and book loads with Amazon through mobile apps using automated, dynamic pricing offers. 74 I 2021 EDELMAN AWARD 2021 EDELMAN AWARD I 75 \n\n# IN FO RMS INFORMS \n\n# ABOUT INFORMS \n\nThe Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences \n\n# From increased efficiency in business processes that leads to millions in savings, to lifesaving advancements in medical treatments, to revolutionized transportation and delivery systems, analytics and operations research (O.R.) are truly saving lives, saving money, and solving problems.

In addition, within our membership are smaller specialized subdivisions that are dedicated to a common theme or technical interest, many of which directly pertain to analytics and operations research applications for industry. Our members are embracing complex problems and unlocking the valuable data needed to enhance decision-making processes and improve day-to-day operations in almost every industry sector. INFORMS would like to congratulate and thank the 2021 Franz Edelman Award finalists, both for their incredible contributions today, as well as inspiring the great discoveries and advancements of tomorrow. ADVANCING THE PRACTICE OF O.R. & ADVANCED ANALYTICS \n\nBy Srinivas Bollapragada President, INFORMS Section on Practice \n\n# Tonight we celebrate outstanding achievements in operations research and advanced analytics. This Award Ceremony and the competitions for the Edelman Award, Wagner Prize, and UPS George D. Smith Prize are all conducted by volunteers of the INFORMS Section on Practice. Details on these competitions are described in this program book. The focus of our Section is on promoting the practice of operations research and advanced analytics through the stewardship of competitions dedicated to highlighting the best practices of our profession. We also organize a set of practice-related presentations at the INFORMS Annual Meeting in the fall and publish biannual newsletters for Section members. Recently, we started organizing monthly webinars to bring awareness of the value of applying analytics to real-world problems, and monthly happy hours to promote networking, especially during this pandemic when many of us are working from home. Please visit the Practice Section website at connect.informs.org/practice for more information on the Section and all of its activities. We invite you to join our exceptional group of volunteers who are dedicated to improving the world by using operations research and analytics to save lives, save money, and solve problems. Our volunteers are from many different organizations in industry, academia, and government, and they have different perspectives to share. Collaborating and networking with this group while contributing to the advancement of our profession is stimulating and rewarding. If you are interested in volunteering with the INFORMS Section on Practice, please send an email to me at: bollapragada@ge.com. \n\n# CALL FOR INFORMS AWARD SUBMISSIONS \n\nDescriptions of INFORMS awards and prizes, and submission deadlines listed here.

FREE.\n\n[Find Scholarships](https://www.fastweb.com/registration/step_1)\n\nWhat are Scholarships?\n----------------------\n\nMany high school students, parents and current college students are shocked to hear there are thousands upon thousands of college scholarships available to college students in the United States.\n\nA scholarship is FREE money (money you will not have to pay back after graduation). It’s not a student loan; scholarships are a gift that does not have to be repaid. As the cost of college continues to rise, applying for scholarships should be a priority for all college-bound students and current college students.\n\nScholarship money can be used to pay for tuition and fees, but also room and board and the hidden (sometimes forgotten cost) of pricey university textbooks.\n\nUncovering scholarships for college students and college bound students can feel overwhelming. When looking for ways to pay for college, parents and students want to know how to get scholarships for college, how to apply for college scholarships, and how to find college scholarships.

I figured, they'll be paying the same amount of money either way, so why not get a car and a college education? At first it was tedious, filling out all the applications, writing essays, and doing whatever else each scholarship required, but when I got my first phone call that I had won a scholarship, it made it all worth while. I mean, winning $4,000 just for spending two hours writing an essay or letting people know about all the achievements I had in high school was definitely worth it. I would have worked hard in high school even if I was not going to get anything out of it. But Scholarships.com helped me find organizations who were willing to reward those who worked as hard as I did. The biggest thing about students and scholarships, is people are not willing to even apply. There was one scholarship I won just because I was the only person to send in an application! People think, oh, I'll never win it, and don't bother to apply. It does not take that much time, and even if you don't win, the experience is still worth it. I applied to many scholarships, two of the ones I actually won were The Elks Most Valuable Student Scholarship and The Earl Anthony Memorial Scholarship.

Having been in the US for only about 2 months, I was still a non-resident in California. Hence I was supposed to pay non-resident tuition as well for the whole year, which seemed almost impossible. It was only then that one of my cousins was standing by my side watching me as I went on from web to web when she asked me what kind of college I was looking for.

It was a private school and my family had always gotten by and then some. We just couldn't afford tuition for such a prestigious college. However, as I grew older and was exposed to all of my options, my hope grew as well. I also knew that although my grades were great and I was proud of myself as an academic, I was not running with the top dogs, so to speak. I wasn't in the top ten percent and I didn't play sports. That put a lot of scholarships far from my grasp. My numbers were good though from test scores to GPA. So, I began searching every outlet for independent scholarships, which is what brought me to Scholarships.com. Also, this was the same time that I finally decided to apply at Baylor, and I got in! I'm telling the absolute truth when I say that the day my acceptance letter came in the mail, I literally jumped up and down, the paper worth its weight in gold to me. All I had to worry about now was the dark cloud hanging over my head, the money. It turns out, Baylor awarded me enough scholarship, financial aid, and work-study money and I would be able to attend class there in the fall! I couldn't be happier with the way things played out, even though I wasn't awarded any independent scholarships from the websites.

However it soon became apparent that there was no need to fret about finding a scholarship that suits my own personal achievement in these qualities. Scholarships.com did all the work and accurately conducted a search and gave me a colorful list of scholarships that were appropriate for me. Even more, with senior year being so busy and senioritis at its worse, applying for scholarships seems to be the one thing that always gets pushed the furthest down the to-do list.

It's meant to be a fun and creative way to earn scholarship money!\n\n> \"I am the scholarship administrator for Church Hill Classics' 'Frame My Future' Scholarship Contest, and am writing to share the success of our first year running this program. Church Hill Classics created the 'Frame My Future' Scholarship Contest in an effort to give back during these challenging economic times. With our different approach in scholarship requirements, it has encouraged students across the nation to create visions for themselves for their own success and futures. After a seven-month entry period, asking students to frame their future on an 8.5” x 11” piece of paper, and expressing how they see themselves in their personal and professional lives after college, we received over 3,300 entries and visions! It was quite inspiring. I posted information about our scholarship on Scholarships.com back in September, where they featured us on their blog, as a 'Scholarship of the Week.' This site communicated our scholarship to so many of its members, driving students to our scholarship’s entry page. We want to say thank you to Scholarships.com for being a trustworthy communication channel to so many success-driven students.\"\n> \n> \n> - Jessica Joram\n> \n>  Church Hill Classics' \"Frame My Future\" Scholarship Contest\n\n![Image 394](https://www.scholarships.com/img/successstories/frame125hat.jpg)\n\n### Jessie Osborne\n\nScholarship Provider\n\n AFA Teens, a branch of Alzheimer's Foundation of America\n\n#### Scholarship Submitted: AFA Teens for Alzheimer’s Awareness College Scholarship\n\nIn an effort to provide an outlet for teenagers to express their thoughts about Alzheimer’s disease and to engage the younger generation in this important cause, the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America (AFA) offers the AFA Teens for Alzheimer’s Awareness College Scholarship.\n\n> \"I am the public relations assistant and AFA Teens coordinator at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and I would like to thank you for selecting us as the scholarship of the week.

Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_County,_Mississippi \"Warren County, Mississippi\"), United States. It is the county seat. The population was 21,573 at the [2020 census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_census \"2020 United States census\").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-2020_Census_(City)-7) Located on a high [bluff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluff_(geography) \"Bluff (geography)\") on the east bank of the [Mississippi River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\") across from [Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\"), Vicksburg was built by French colonists in 1719. The outpost withstood an attack from the native [Natchez people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchez_people \"Natchez people\"). It was incorporated as Vicksburg in 1825 after [Methodist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism \"Methodism\") missionary Newitt Vick.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-10) The area that is now Vicksburg was long occupied by the [Natchez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchez_people \"Natchez people\") as part of their historical territory along the Mississippi. The first [Europeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Americans \"European Americans\") who settled the area were [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people \"French people\") colonists who built [Fort Saint Pierre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_St._Pierre_Site \"Fort St. Pierre Site\") in 1719 on the high bluffs overlooking the [Yazoo River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazoo_River \"Yazoo River\") at present-day [Redwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwood,_Mississippi \"Redwood, Mississippi\"). They conducted [fur trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_trading \"Fur trading\") with the Natchez and others, and started plantations. During the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\"), it was a key Confederate river-port, and its [July 1863 surrender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Vicksburg \"Siege of Vicksburg\") to [Ulysses S. Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S. Grant\"), along with the concurrent [Battle of Gettysburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg \"Battle of Gettysburg\"), marked the turning-point of the war.\n\nAfter the war came the [Reconstruction era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era \"Reconstruction era\") and then a violent return to power by [white supremacists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy \"White supremacy\") in 1874 and 1875, including the [Vicksburg massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg_massacre \"Vicksburg massacre\"). Today, Vicksburg's population is majority [African American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American \"African American\"). The city is home to three large installations of the [United States Army Corps of Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers \"United States Army Corps of Engineers\"), which has often been involved in local flood control.\n\nThe area that is now Vicksburg was long occupied by the [Natchez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchez_people \"Natchez people\")[Native Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native Americans in the United States\") as part of their historical territory along the Mississippi. The Natchez spoke a language isolate not related to the [Muskogean languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskogean_languages \"Muskogean languages\") of the other major tribes in the area. Before the Natchez, other indigenous cultures had occupied this strategic area for thousands of years.\n\n### European settlement\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vicksburg,_Mississippi&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: European settlement\")]\n\nThe first [Europeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Americans \"European Americans\") who settled the area were [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people \"French people\") colonists who built [Fort Saint Pierre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_St._Pierre_Site \"Fort St. Pierre Site\") in 1719 on the high bluffs overlooking the Yazoo River at present-day [Redwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwood,_Mississippi \"Redwood, Mississippi\"). They conducted [fur trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_trading \"Fur trading\") with the Natchez and others, and started plantations. On 29 November 1729, the Natchez [attacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchez_revolt \"Natchez revolt\") the fort and plantations in and around the present-day city of [Natchez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchez,_Mississippi \"Natchez, Mississippi\"). They murdered several hundred settlers, including [Jesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus \"Society of Jesus\") missionary Paul Du Poisson. As was the custom, they violently took a number of women and children as captives, adopting them into their families.\n\nThe Natchez War was a disaster for French Louisiana, and the colonial population of the Natchez District never recovered. Aided by the [Choctaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choctaw \"Choctaw\"), traditional enemies of the Natchez, though, the French defeated and scattered the Natchez and their allies, the [Yazoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazoo_tribe \"Yazoo tribe\").\n\nThe Choctaw Nation took over the area by right of conquest and inhabited it for several decades. Under pressure from the US government, the Choctaw agreed to cede nearly 2,000,000 acres (8,100 km 2) of land to the US under the terms of the [Treaty of Fort Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Adams \"Treaty of Fort Adams\") in 1801. The treaty was the first of a series that eventually led to the [removal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal \"Indian Removal\") of most of the Choctaw to [Indian Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Territory \"Indian Territory\") west of the Mississippi River in 1830. Some Choctaw remained in Mississippi, citing article XIV of the [Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Dancing_Rabbit_Creek \"Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek\"); they became citizens of the state and the United States. They struggled to maintain their culture against the pressure of the binary slave society, which classified people as only white or black.\n\nIn 1790, the Spanish founded a military outpost on the site, which they called [Fort Nogales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Nogales \"Fort Nogales\") (_nogales_ meaning \"walnut trees\"). When the Americans took possession in 1798 following the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American Revolutionary War\") and a treaty with Spain, they changed the name to [Walnut Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut_Hills_(Mississippi) \"Walnut Hills (Mississippi)\"). The small village was incorporated in 1825 as Vicksburg, named after Newitt Vick, a [Methodist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist \"Methodist\")[minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(Christianity) \"Minister (Christianity)\") who had established a Protestant mission on the site.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-11)\n\n[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Vicksburg_gambler_hanging_1835.jpg/250px-Vicksburg_gambler_hanging_1835.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vicksburg_gambler_hanging_1835.jpg)\n\nDrawing of the hanging of five gamblers in Vicksburg in 1835\n\n[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/View_of_Vicksburg%2C_Mississippi.jpg/250px-View_of_Vicksburg%2C_Mississippi.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:View_of_Vicksburg,_Mississippi.jpg)\n\nView of Vicksburg in 1855\n\nThe town of Vicksburg was incorporated in 1825, with a population of 3,000 people; of which approximately twenty people were [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_slavery \"Jewish views on slavery\") and had immigrated from [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria \"Bavaria\"), [Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia \"Prussia\"), and [Alsace–Lorraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace%E2%80%93Lorraine \"Alsace–Lorraine\").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-:0-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-vicksburgpost.com-13)\n\nIn 1835, during the [Murrell Excitement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murrell_(bandit) \"John Murrell (bandit)\"), a mob from Vicksburg attempted to expel the gamblers from the city, because the citizens were tired of the rougher element treating the city residents with contempt. They captured and hanged five gamblers who had shot and killed a local doctor.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-14) Historian Joshua D. Rothman calls this event \"the deadliest outbreak of extralegal violence in the slave states between the [Southampton Insurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_Insurrection \"Southampton Insurrection\") and the Civil War.\"[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-15)\n\nIn 1862, fifty Jewish families formed the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Anshe Chesed in Vicksburg, and received a charter from the state.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-vicksburgpost.com-13) Two years later in 1864, the [Anshe Chesed Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshe_Chesed_Cemetery \"Anshe Chesed Cemetery\") was formed, and it was the second [Jewish cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_cemetery \"Jewish cemetery\") in the city; not much is known about the first Jewish cemetery.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-:0-12)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-16)\n\nThe Confederate president, [Jefferson Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Davis \"Jefferson Davis\"), was based at his family plantation at [Brierfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brierfield_Plantation \"Brierfield Plantation\"), just south of the city.\n\nDuring the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") (1861–1865), the city finally surrendered during the [Siege of Vicksburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Vicksburg \"Siege of Vicksburg\"), after which the [Union Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army \"Union Army\") gained control of the entire Mississippi River. The 47-day siege was intended to starve the city into submission. Its location atop a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi River proved otherwise impregnable to assault by federal troops. The surrender of Vicksburg by Confederate General [John C. Pemberton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Pemberton \"John C. Pemberton\") on July 4, 1863, together with the defeat of General [Robert E. Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee \"Robert E. Lee\") at [Gettysburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg \"Battle of Gettysburg\") the day before, has historically marked the [turning point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_point_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Turning point of the American Civil War\") of the Civil War in the Union's favor.\n\nFrom the surrender of Vicksburg until the end of the war in 1865, the area was under Union military occupation.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-17)\n\nCelebrations of the 4th of July, the day of surrender, were irregular until 1947. The _[Vicksburg Evening Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg\\_Evening\\_Post \"Vicksburg Evening Post\")_ of July 4, 1883, called July 4 \"the day we don't celebrate\",[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-18) and another Vicksburg newspaper, the _Daily Commercial Appeal_, in 1888 hoped that a political victory would bring an enthusiastic celebration the following year.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-19) In 1902, the 4th of July saw only \"a parade of colored draymen\".[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-20) In 1947, the Jackson _Clarion-Ledger_ stated that the city of Vicksburg did not celebrate the 4th of July again until 1945, and then it was celebrated as Confederate Carnival Day.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-21) A recent scholar disagrees, stating that large Fourth of July celebrations were being held by 1907, and informal celebrations before that.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-23) A large parade was held in 1890.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-24)\n\n### Loss of Mississippi access and commercial status\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vicksburg,_Mississippi&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Loss of Mississippi access and commercial status\")]\n\n[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Mississippi_River_floating_dry_dock_-_Vicksburg.jpg/250px-Mississippi_River_floating_dry_dock_-_Vicksburg.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mississippi_River_floating_dry_dock_-_Vicksburg.jpg)\n\nFloating [drydock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drydock \"Drydock\") in Vicksburg, circa 1905\n\nBecause of Vicksburg's location on the Mississippi River, it built extensive trade from the prodigious [steamboat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat \"Steamboat\") traffic in the 19th century. It shipped out cotton coming to it from surrounding counties and was a major trading city in West Central Mississippi.\n\nHowever, in 1876, a Mississippi River flood cut off the large [meander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meander \"Meander\") next to Vicksburg through the De Soto Point, which changed the Mississippi River's course away from the city. Vicksburg only retained access to an [oxbow lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxbow_lake \"Oxbow lake\") formed from the old channel of the river, which effectively isolated the city from accessing the Mississippi riverfront. The city's economy suffered greatly due to the lack of a functional river port; Vicksburg would not be a river town again until the completion of the Yazoo Diversion Canal in 1903 by the [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army_Corps_of_Engineers \"U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-25)\n\n### Political and racial unrest after Civil War\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vicksburg,_Mississippi&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Political and racial unrest after Civil War\")]\n\nIn the first few years after the Civil War, white Confederate veterans developed the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan \"Ku Klux Klan\"), beginning in Tennessee; it had chapters throughout the South and attacked freedmen and their supporters. It was suppressed about 1870. By the mid-1870s, new white [paramilitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary \"Paramilitary\") groups had arisen in the [Deep South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South \"Deep South\"), including the [Red Shirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Shirts_(Southern_United_States) \"Red Shirts (Southern United States)\") in Mississippi, as whites struggled to regain political and social power over the black majority. Elections were marked by violence and fraud as white Democrats worked to suppress black Republican voting.\n\nIn August 1874, a black sheriff, [Peter Crosby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Crosby_(sheriff) \"Peter Crosby (sheriff)\"), was elected in Vicksburg. Letters by a white planter, Batchelor, detail the preparations of whites for what he described as a \"race war,\" including acquisition of the newest Winchester guns. On December 7, 1874, white men disrupted a black Republican meeting celebrating Crosby's victory and held him in custody before running him out of town.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-26) He advised blacks from rural areas to return home; along the way, some were attacked by armed whites. During the next several days, armed white mobs swept through black areas, killing other men at home or out in the fields, in what would come to be known as the [Vicksburg massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg_massacre \"Vicksburg massacre\"). Sources differ as to total fatalities, with 29–50 blacks and 2 whites reported dead at the time. Twenty-first-century historian Emilye Crosby estimates that 300 blacks were killed in the city and the surrounding area of [Claiborne County, Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claiborne_County,_Mississippi \"Claiborne County, Mississippi\").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-crosby-27) The Red Shirts were active in Vicksburg and other Mississippi areas, and black pleas to the federal government for protection were not met.\n\nAt the request of Republican Governor [Adelbert Ames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelbert_Ames \"Adelbert Ames\"), who had left the state during the violence, President [Ulysses S. Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S. Grant\") sent federal troops to Vicksburg in January 1875. In addition, a congressional committee investigated what was called the \"Vicksburg Riot\" at the time (and reported as the \"Vicksburg massacre\" by northern newspapers.) Testimony from both black and white residents was given, as reported by the _New York Times_, but no one was ever prosecuted for the deaths. The Red Shirts and other white [insurgents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgents \"Insurgents\") suppressed Republican voting by both whites and blacks; smaller-scale riots were staged in the state up to the 1875 elections, at which time white Democrats regained control of a majority of seats in the state legislature.\n\nUnder new constitutions, amendments and laws passed between 1890 in Mississippi and 1908 in the remaining southern states, white Democrats [disenfranchised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement_after_Reconstruction_era \"Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era\") most blacks and many poor whites by creating barriers to voter registration, such as [poll taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_tax_(United_States) \"Poll tax (United States)\"), [literacy tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_test \"Literacy test\"), and [grandfather clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause \"Grandfather clause\"). They passed [Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws \"Jim Crow laws\") through which they imposed racial segregation of public facilities. In 1908, a publication documented some of Vicksburg's leading African Americans including lawyer and banker [W. E. Mollison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._Mollison \"W. E. Mollison\").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-28)\n\nOn March 12, 1894, the popular soft drink [Coca-Cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola \"Coca-Cola\") was bottled for the first time in Vicksburg by [Joseph A. Biedenharn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_A._Biedenharn \"Joseph A. Biedenharn\"), a local [confectioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery \"Confectionery\"). Today, surviving 19th-century Biedenharn [soda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink \"Soft drink\")[bottles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle \"Bottle\") are prized by collectors of Coca-Cola memorabilia. The original candy store has been renovated and is used as the Biedenharn Coca-Cola Museum.\n\n[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Mississippi_River_Commission_building_in_Vicksburg.jpg/250px-Mississippi_River_Commission_building_in_Vicksburg.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mississippi_River_Commission_building_in_Vicksburg.jpg)\n\nMississippi River Commission building, built 1894\n\n[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Mississippi_-_Vicksburg_-_NARA_-_23941741_%28cropped%29.jpg/250px-Mississippi_-_Vicksburg_-_NARA_-_23941741_%28cropped%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mississippi_-_Vicksburg_-_NARA_-_23941741_(cropped).jpg)\n\nAerial view, 1932\n\nThe exclusion of most blacks from the political system lasted for decades until after Congressional passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s. [Lynchings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States \"Lynching in the United States\") of blacks and other forms of white racial terrorism against them continued to occur in Vicksburg after the start of the 20th century. In May 1903, for instance, two black men charged with murdering a planter were taken from jail by a mob of 200 farmers and lynched before they could go to trial.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-29) In May 1919, as many as a thousand white men broke down three sets of steel doors to abduct, hang, burn and shoot a black prisoner, Lloyd Clay, who was falsely accused of raping a white woman.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-AC_Clay-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-31) From 1877 to 1950 in Warren County, 14 African Americans were lynched by whites, most in the decades near the turn of the century.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-eji-32)\n\nThe [United States Army Corps of Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers \"United States Army Corps of Engineers\") diverted the Yazoo River in 1903 into the old, shallowing channel to revive the waterfront of Vicksburg. The port city was able to receive steamboats again, but much freight and passenger traffic had moved to railroads, which had become more competitive.\n\nRailroad access to the west across the river continued to be by transfer steamers and ferry [barges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barges \"Barges\") until a combination railroad-highway bridge was built in 1929. After 1973, [Interstate 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_20 \"Interstate 20\") bridged the river. Freight rail traffic still crosses by the old bridge. North-south transportation links are by the Mississippi River and [U.S. Highway 61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Highway_61 \"U.S. Highway 61\"). Vicksburg has the only crossing over the Mississippi River between [Greenville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_Mississippi \"Greenville, Mississippi\") and Natchez, and the only interstate highway crossing of the river between [Baton Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge \"Baton Rouge\") and [Memphis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee \"Memphis, Tennessee\").\n\nDuring the [Great Mississippi Flood of 1927](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mississippi_Flood_of_1927 \"Great Mississippi Flood of 1927\"), in which hundreds of thousands of acres were inundated, Vicksburg served as the primary gathering point for refugees. Relief parties put up temporary housing, as the flood submerged a large percentage of the [Mississippi Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Delta \"Mississippi Delta\").\n\nBecause of the overwhelming damage from the flood, the US Army Corps of Engineers established the Waterways Experiment Station as the primary hydraulics laboratory, to develop protection of important croplands and cities. Now known as the [Engineer Research and Development Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer_Research_and_Development_Center \"Engineer Research and Development Center\"), it applies military engineering, information technology, environmental engineering, hydraulic engineering, and geotechnical engineering to problems of flood control and river navigation.\n\nIn December 1953, a [severe tornado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Vicksburg,_Mississippi_tornado_outbreak \"1953 Vicksburg, Mississippi tornado outbreak\") swept across Vicksburg, causing 38 deaths and destroying nearly 1,000 buildings.\n\n[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Vicksburg_1910_LOC_pan_6a13672.jpg/1600px-Vicksburg_1910_LOC_pan_6a13672.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vicksburg_1910_LOC_pan_6a13672.jpg \"A 1910 panorama\")\n\nA 1910 panorama\n\nDuring World War II, cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Vicksburg on training flights. The town served as a stand-in for the British for Cologne, Germany, which is the same distance from London, England as Vicksburg is from Terrell.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-33)\n\nParticularly after World War II, in which many blacks served, returning veterans began to be active in the civil rights movement, wanting to have full citizenship after fighting in the war. In Mississippi, activists in the Vicksburg Movement became prominent during the 1960s.\n\nIn 2001, a group of Vicksburg residents visited the [Paducah, Kentucky, mural project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paducah,_Kentucky#Contemporary_Paducah \"Paducah, Kentucky\"), looking for ideas for their own community development.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-34) In 2002, the Vicksburg Riverfront [murals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mural \"Mural\") program was begun by [Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\") mural artist [Robert Dafford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dafford \"Robert Dafford\") and his team on the floodwall located on the waterfront in downtown.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-riverfrontmurals.com-35) Subjects for the murals were drawn from the history of Vicksburg and the surrounding area. They include President [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore Roosevelt\")'s bear hunt, the [_Sultana_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultana_(steamboat) \"Sultana (steamboat)\"), the [_Sprague_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague_(towboat) \"Sprague (towboat)\"), the [Siege of Vicksburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Vicksburg \"Siege of Vicksburg\"), the [Kings Crossing site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Crossing_site \"Kings Crossing site\"), [Willie Dixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Dixon \"Willie Dixon\"), the [Flood of 1927](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mississippi_Flood_of_1927 \"Great Mississippi Flood of 1927\"), the [1953 Vicksburg, Mississippi tornado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Vicksburg,_Mississippi_tornado \"1953 Vicksburg, Mississippi tornado\"), [Rosa A. Temple High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_A._Temple_High_School \"Rosa A. Temple High School\") (known for integration activism) and the [Vicksburg National Military Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg_National_Military_Park \"Vicksburg National Military Park\").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-36) The project was finished in 2009 with the completion of the Jitney Jungle/Glass Kitchen mural.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-riverfrontmurals.com-35)\n\nIn the fall of 2010, a new 55-foot mural was painted on a section of wall on Grove Hill across the street from the original project by former Dafford muralists Benny Graeff and [Herb Roe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Roe \"Herb Roe\"). The mural's subject is the annual \"Run thru History\" held in the Vicksburg National Military Park.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-38)\n\nOn December 6–7, 2014, a symposium was held on the 140th anniversary of the 1874 riots. A variety of scholars gave papers and an open panel discussion was held on the second day at the Vicksburg National Military Park, in collaboration with the Jacqueline House African American Museum.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-39)\n\nAccording to the [United States Census Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau \"United States Census Bureau\"), the city has a total area of 35.093 square miles (90.89 km 2), of which 33.017 square miles (85.51 km 2) is land and 2.076 square miles (5.38 km 2) is water.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi#cite_note-CenPopGazetteer2024-5)\n\nVicksburg is located at the [confluence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence \"Confluence\") of the Mississippi and Yazoo Rivers. Much of the city is on top of a high bluff on the east bank of the Mississippi River. Vicksburg is also served by [Interstate 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_20 \"Interstate 20\"). The interstate opens Vicksburg with a [cloverleaf interchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloverleaf_interchange \"Cloverleaf interchange\") that heads out to [U.S. Route 61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_61 \"U.S. Route 61\") North towards [Rolling Fork, Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Fork,_Mississippi \"Rolling Fork, Mississippi\"), [Clarksdale, Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarksdale,_Mississippi \"Clarksdale, Mississippi\"), and stretches out for another 77 miles towards [Memphis, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee \"Memphis, Tennessee\"). On the south part of the exit, it heads on [Mississippi Highway 27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Highway_27 \"Mississippi Highway 27\") towards [Utica, Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_Mississippi \"Utica, Mississippi\"). As the interstate goes on it makes interchanges with Clay Street, Indiana Avenue, and Halls Ferry Road. After the downtown interchanges are over, before finally crossing in Louisiana with a [cloverleaf interchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloverleaf_interchange \"Cloverleaf interchange\"), I-20 makes a [directional T interchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_T_interchange \"Directional T interchange\") with US-61, and US-61 heads south toward [Port Gibson, Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Gibson,_Mississippi \"Port Gibson, Mississippi\"), [Natchez, Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchez,_Mississippi \"Natchez, Mississippi\"), and then continues for another 92 miles into [Baton Rouge, Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana \"Baton Rouge, Louisiana\"), Louisiana's capital city. Interstate 20 then continues to head west towards [Monroe, Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe,_Louisiana \"Monroe, Louisiana\"), [Shreveport, Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreveport,_Louisiana \"Shreveport, Louisiana\"), [Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas \"Dallas\"), and lastly after 445 miles, making a [trumpet
