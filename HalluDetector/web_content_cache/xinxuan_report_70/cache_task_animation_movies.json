'Klaus' is celebrated for its distinctive animation style, merging traditional 2D with contemporary techniques, offering a visually captivating experience. The narrative, centered on kindness and community change, strikes a chord, though some view it as overly sentimental or predictable. Characters, especially Jesper and Klaus, are appreciated for their growth and charm, yet a few critics argue they lack complexity. Voice acting, particularly J.K. Simmons' performance, garners high praise. The film's pacing and humor elicit mixed reactions, with some enjoying the equilibrium and others finding it inconsistent. Overall, 'Klaus' is regarded as a charming holiday film with a timeless theme, though it may not universally resonate.\nAI-generated from the text of user reviews\nAnimation style\nAuthentic emotion\nCharacter development\nComedic brilliance\nFamily dynamics\nFriendship\nHeartfelt\nInspirational\nProduction design\nFeatured reviews\n8\ncricketbat (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6201371/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_uname)\nIn a sea of generic Christmas movies, Klaus stands out (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/reviews/?featured=rw5341855&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_hd)\nKlaus is an amusing new twist on a very old story. It's a heart-warming tale with an uplifting message about kindness, featuring beautifully unique animation, interesting characters, and a clever plot. In the sea of generic Christmas movies that get churned out each holiday season, Klaus stands out because it tried something different and it succeeded.\n10\nkaleem_091983 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22709105/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_uname)\nI am not crying, you are crying.

Netflix please keep bringing us movies with great script such as this.\n8\nkosmasp (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5876717/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_uname)\nKlaus begins (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/reviews/?featured=rw5533859&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_hd)\nAs another reviewer stated this was a nice surprise! I did not expect it to be as good as it was. I thought it'd be just another animated movie, light fun and all. But it really has quite some heart to it. And it's an origin story as well. Many little things that work quite well. Be it the opposing groups, that have more in common that one may think. Or the adults versus kids/younger ones theme that runs through the whole thing.\nThe animation may be a point of criticism for some, but overall that is nice too. Not to mention the voice talent recruited. While you may know where this will eventually be heading, the beginning at least may surprise you. In a positive way - as is the rest of the movie\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n8.4\nCoco (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n8.1\nInside Out (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n8.3\nUp (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n8.1\nRatatouille (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_4)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_5)\n8.2\nFinding Nemo (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_5)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_6)\n8.1\nMonsters, Inc.

The exploration of the multiverse and diverse Spider-Man characters is praised for originality. Character development, especially Miles Morales and Peter Parker, adds depth. However, some criticize pacing, plot inconsistencies, and over-reliance on visuals. Political and social themes receive mixed feedback. Voice acting and soundtrack are divisive, with some appreciating performances and others finding them lacking.\nAI-generated from the text of user reviews\nAction sequences\nAnimation style\nCharacter development\nComedic brilliance\nFamily dynamics\nSoundtrack\nVisual innovation\nSocial commentary\nFeatured reviews\n9\nmatthewssilverhammer (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19752191/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_uname)\nHow on God's green Earth did this work so well??? (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/reviews/?featured=rw4525715&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_hd)\nThe worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the \"extended universe\", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes.\nListen, I hear you. \"How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?\" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have?\nLook, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough.\n10\nHitchcoc (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0278527/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_uname)\nSo Much More Than I Expected! (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/reviews/?featured=rw5267954&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_hd)\nSo many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, \"This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman.\" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation, but this has restored my faith.\n10\neaglescout910 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53200103/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_uname)\nStan Lee Is Smiling Right Now (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/reviews/?featured=rw4516839&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_hd)\nA movie worthy of Stan Lee's approval. Incredible animation, great story, great message. This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations. The only reason I think there are some negative reviews is because you can never please everyone. However, for the vast majority of viewers, I believe you'll find this film to be great. Highly recommend seeing it in theaters just for the amazing animation style.\n10\nCizzurp215 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27159660/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_uname)\nA Spidey Movie That Works In Multiple Dimensions (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/reviews/?featured=rw4510248&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_hd)\nVisually stunning. Great storyline. Great cast. Amazing soundtrack. Tear jerking cameo. Pop culture post credit scene of the decade. Thank you Marvel and Sony for making a Spidey movie everyone can love.\n10\nsoulsplosion (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur93280127/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_uname)\nthe most visually stunning film I've ever seen (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/reviews/?featured=rw4521959&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_hd)\nThere's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way.\n'Spider-Verse' Cast Share Their Dream Spidey Versions\n'Spider-Verse' Cast Share Their Dream Spidey Versions\nFrom Spider-Ma'am to a hip-hop version of the superhero, the stars of\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/?ref_=tt_eds_center-3_lk)\nshare the versions of Spider-Man that they want to see on the big screen.\nWatch our interview (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls047723173/videoplayer/vi2227681817?ref_=tt_c_ecw_sv1_cta)\n1:50 (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls047723173/videoplayer/vi2227681817?ref_=tt_ecw_sv1_i)\n2\n5\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9362722/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n8.5\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9362722/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n8.4\nWALL·E (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n8.3\nToy Story (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n8.4\nCoco (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_4)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_5)\n8.3\nUp (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_5)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_6)\n8.0\nThe Incredibles (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_6)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_7)\n8.1\nInside Out (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_7)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_8)\n8.1\nMonsters, Inc.

Miles has grown more confident, more skillful, and more comfortable with his new powers and is finally ready to take on the role of Spider-Man; thus the costume (like the role itself) finally \"fits\".\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/goofs/?tab=gf&ref_=tt_dyk_gf)\nQuotes (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/quotes/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\nStan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498278/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\n: That person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/quotes/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\nCrazy credits (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/crazycredits/?tab=cz&ref_=tt_dyk_cc)\nThere is a dedication in the closing credits to \"Spider-Man\" creators\nStan Lee (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498278/?ref_=dyk_cc)\nand\nSteve Ditko (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0228492/?ref_=dyk_cc)\n, who passed away in 2018.\nIt is an image of Stan Lee's glasses with a quote: \"That person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero. - Stan Lee\"  \"Thank you Stan Lee & Steve Ditko for telling us we're not the only ones.\"\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/crazycredits/?tab=cz&ref_=tt_dyk_cc)\nAlternate versions (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/alternateversions/?tab=cz&ref_=tt_dyk_alt)\nThe Blu-Ray for the film features an \"Alternate Universe Cut,\" featuring unseen, unfinished and unused footage, which shows alternate scenarios for certain scenes and extends the runtime to 2h 23m instead of the original 1h 57m.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/alternateversions/?tab=cz&ref_=tt_dyk_alt)\nConnections (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/movieconnections/?ref_=tt_dyk_cnn)\nEdited from\nCat Ballou (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059017/?ref_=tt_dyk_cnn)\n(1965)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/movieconnections/?ref_=tt_dyk_cnn)\nSoundtracks (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/soundtrack/?ref_=tt_dyk_snd)\nPeople Get Up and Drive Your Funky Soul (Remix)\nWritten by\nJames Brown (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0113768/?ref_=dyk_snd)\n,\nSt. Clair Pinckney (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8383679/?ref_=dyk_snd)\nand\nFred Wesley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0921739/?ref_=dyk_snd)\nPerformed by\nJames Brown (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0113768/?ref_=dyk_snd)\nCourtesy of Republic Records\nUnder license from Universal Music Enterprises\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/soundtrack/?ref_=tt_dyk_snd)\nTop picks (https://www.imdb.com/what-to-watch/top-picks/?ref_=tt_tpks_sm)\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin?ref_=tt_tpks_signin)\nFAQ19 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/faq/?ref_=tt_faq_sm)\nHow long is Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse?

'Coco' is celebrated for its stunning animation, vibrant colors, and intricate details, alongside soulful music, especially \"Remember Me.\" Themes of family, memory, tradition, and Mexican culture, particularly the Day of the Dead, are highlighted. The storytelling is noted for its poignancy and excitement, often evoking strong emotions. Some praise the respectful and accurate portrayal of Mexican traditions, while others find the script and plot simplistic. The animation and visual spectacle are consistently lauded.\nAI-generated from the text of user reviews\nAnimation style\nAuthentic emotion\nCharacter development\nComforting\nEmotional weight\nFamily dynamics\nGenerational appeal\nHeartfelt\nMusical score\nVisual spectacle\nFeatured reviews\n10\njon-stokes21-539-17875 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur38077550/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_uname)\nShocked! (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/reviews/?featured=rw3872249&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_hd)\nI knew absolutely nothing about this movie walking in, the only reason I was there was to take my daughter to see it is strictly because my wife said there was a short Frozen film that played along with the movie and my daughter just so happens to be the biggest Frozen fan on the face of the planet.\nNot only was I surprised by Coco, it might be the most in depth best story line I've ever seen in an animated movie. It was also educational and shed an entirely new light on the background of the Mexican holiday Dia De Los Muertos.\nWonderful movie, can't say enough good things about it!\n8\nJared_Andrews (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53660798/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_uname)\nA Charming Depiction of a Beautiful Spanish-Language Tradition (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/reviews/?featured=rw4029309&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_hd)\nCoco tells the story of young boy named Miguel living in Mexico (Coco is his great grandmother). Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On Día de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family's ban on music.\nIn his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of Día de Muertos.\nOf course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it's beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel.\nQuick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about Día de Muertos. Sort of. I'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn't paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about Día de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes.\nIn high school, my understanding of Día de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly.\nIt's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It's about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture. Bravo!\n10\npramsalim (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur77165650/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_uname)\nI cried twice watching this. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/reviews/?featured=rw3872461&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_hd)\nI have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.\nThough the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.\nCoco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I'm sure they'll like it and I'm sure you'll hug 'em all as soon as the credits roll.\n10\nCharliedog2015 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32837247/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_uname)\nHeartbreakingly beautiful. Surpasses Up and Inside Out (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/reviews/?featured=rw4130315&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_hd)\nCoco is about Dias de las Muerte (Day of the Dead), family, family crises and musical passion. The posters have a boy and an adult skeleton capering through the afterlife. So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.\nWe were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)\nIt surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. \"there will be no X in this family!\" X being \"instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past\". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?\nDid I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them \"mama, I miss you.\"\nBeautiful.\n10\nilias-zournatzis (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur56991789/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_uname)\nOverwhelmed! (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/reviews/?featured=rw4067024&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_hd)\nI'm a 24 year old student who sometimes tends to overthink about the values of life and how one, including myself, expresses these kinds of thoughts through every form of art that tells a story. So as a person that really puts his soul to a movie he watches I have to say that this film is one of the most beautiful things I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing.\nCoco does a fantastic job of capturing the viewer from the first moment. It cleverly captures the beauty of the \"Day of the Dead\" tradition, by unfolding one of the most heartwarming stories I've ever seen in a movie, around it. The film features a young Musician called Miguel and the pursuit of his dream of being a musician against his family's approval. Throughout the movie while Miguel engages in an adventurous journey through the land of the dead, he is caught between the love he has for music and the importance of family bonds. \nQuiet a simple and pretty well covered subject. Somehow, Coco manages to so simply and beatifully capture the essence of what it means to be human. What it means to love and what it means to have passion for the things and the people you love. The story was told in such an elegant way that it didn't make me think about the values it represented, but instead it made me feel them, without me even analysing what I was watching. It did it so gradually that at some point near the end I was so overwhelmed by a scene, which definetely goes to my \"top 10 best movie scenes\" list, that I caught myself crying. Not tearing up like I usually do when a scene touches me. Actually crying.\nI could go on and on about Coco, but I'll leave with saying that this is a fantastic movie and I honestly feel grateful that I had the chance to watch it.\nA must see!!!\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n8.3\nUp (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n8.1\nInside Out (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n8.4\nWALL·E (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n8.3\nToy Story (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_4)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_5)\n8.2\nFinding Nemo (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_5)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_6)\n8.1\nRatatouille (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_6)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_7)\n8.1\nMonsters, Inc.

He noticed the family Basset hound had to be repeatedly chased away from the ofrenda because it tried to eat the food. He found this so amusing that he included a scene in the movie where Miguel is horrified to find Dante eating food from the ofrenda.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/trivia/?ref_=tt_dyk_trv)\nGoofs (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/goofs/?tab=gf&ref_=tt_dyk_gf)\nThe dead are obviously stuck at the age that they died.

She still wouldn't have known that he intended to come back and could simply think that he died shortly after deserting his family.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/goofs/?tab=gf&ref_=tt_dyk_gf)\nQuotes (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/quotes/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\nHéctor (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0305558/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\n:\n[sings]\nRemember me, though I have to say goodbye / Remember me, don't let it make you cry / For even if I'm far away, I hold you in my heart / I sing a secret song to you, each night we are apart / Remember me, though I have to travel far / Remember me, each time you hear a sad guitar / Know that I'm with you, the only way that I can be / Until you're in my arms again, remember me...\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/quotes/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\nCrazy credits (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/crazycredits/?tab=cz&ref_=tt_dyk_cc)\nAt the end of the closing credits, there is an ofrenda to the deceased people who inspired the filmmakers of Coco, in the form of a mosaic made from photographs.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/crazycredits/?tab=cz&ref_=tt_dyk_cc)\nConnections (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/movieconnections/?ref_=tt_dyk_cnn)\nFeatured in\nWatchMojo: Top 10 Must See Trailers of June 2017 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9292728/?ref_=tt_dyk_cnn)\n(2017)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/movieconnections/?ref_=tt_dyk_cnn)\nSoundtracks (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/soundtrack/?ref_=tt_dyk_snd)\nRemember Me\nMusic & Lyrics by\nKristen Anderson-Lopez (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2844448/?ref_=dyk_snd)\n&\nRobert Lopez (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0520188/?ref_=dyk_snd)\nProduced by\nGermaine Franco (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1184901/?ref_=dyk_snd)\n,\nKristen Anderson-Lopez (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2844448/?ref_=dyk_snd)\n&\nRobert Lopez (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0520188/?ref_=dyk_snd)\nAs Performed by Ernesto de la Cruz -\nBenjamin Bratt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000973/?ref_=dyk_snd)\nAs Performed by Héctor & Young Coco -\nGael García Bernal (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0305558/?ref_=dyk_snd)\n, Gabriella Flores &\nLibertad García Fonzi (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9401750/?ref_=dyk_snd)\nAs Performed by Miguel & Mamá Coco -\nAnthony Gonzalez (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5645519/?ref_=dyk_snd)\n&\nAna Ofelia Murguía (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0613872/?ref_=dyk_snd)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/soundtrack/?ref_=tt_dyk_snd)\nTop picks (https://www.imdb.com/what-to-watch/top-picks/?ref_=tt_tpks_sm)\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in (https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin?ref_=tt_tpks_signin)\nFAQ21 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/faq/?ref_=tt_faq_sm)\nHow long is Coco?

(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4525715/?ref_=tturv_1)\nThe worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the \"extended universe\", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes.\nListen, I hear you. \"How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?\" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have?\nLook, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough.\nHelpful\n•\n266\n88\nmatthewssilverhammer (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19752191/?ref_=tturv_usr_1_t)\nDec 21, 2018\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4525715/?ref_=tturv_perm_1)\n9\n/\n10\nCome on give this a chance (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4523150/?ref_=tturv_2)\nAmazing movie.

It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way.\nHelpful\n•\n650\n160\nsoulsplosion (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur93280127/?ref_=tturv_usr_5_t)\nDec 20, 2018\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4521959/?ref_=tturv_perm_5)\n10\n/\n10\nFantastic...but possibly overwhelming.

(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4524173/?ref_=tturv_7)\nUpdated review 4-9-19\nI've now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn't for everyone. Let's break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.\nIf we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they're great.\nThe story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.\nThe voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.\nShamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I've watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.\nChris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.\nI never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I'm working or doing something else and I'll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.\nI've always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.\nThe greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. \"The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen\". Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn't use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they're seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it's just simply too much for some people. I get that.\nAs far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren't many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.\nOriginal review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.\nWhat is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton's dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they're all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that 'feel the most like a comic book', you'd probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.\nBut they aren't literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really 'just cartoons', and I don't mean that in a bad way. They're simply cartoon versions of comic books.\nSpider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It's an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.\nThis movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I'm-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.\nRemember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like \"oh wow! It's a comic book come to life!\"? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.\nBut here's the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a \"here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!\"\nMy first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I've built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I've gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It's that great.\nHelpful\n•\n478\n143\nthinslicing (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10634750/?ref_=tturv_usr_7_t)\nDec 21, 2018\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4524173/?ref_=tturv_perm_7)\n10\n/\n10\nA Spidey Movie That Works In Multiple Dimensions (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4510248/?ref_=tturv_8)\nVisually stunning.

For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron Man\nWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.\nAnd the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.\nPlus our the villains are so well done..\nBut I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.\nIt's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.\nHelpful\n•\n433\n139\ncafesmitty (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1061970/?ref_=tturv_usr_9_t)\nDec 21, 2018\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4523586/?ref_=tturv_perm_9)\nBest Spider-man movie yet (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4513158/?ref_=tturv_10)\nA coming of age movie for the whole animation genre, which stays true to its medium while nicely embracing the comics medium.\nA really moving movie with an ambitious approach, that surprised me at how much spiderman is instilled in my psyche...even as much as Superman is.\nThe movie simply embraced how the character is a cultural phenomenon, and stopped treating it as merchandise.\nHelpful\n•\n24\n13\nramy-bakir (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur56190323/?ref_=tturv_usr_10_t)\nDec 15, 2018\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4513158/?ref_=tturv_perm_10)\n10\n/\n10\nGiving Infinity war a run for it's money (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4512352/?ref_=tturv_11)\nThis movie was absolutely incredible.

It is easily the best looking animated movie of the year (no surprise there), but what really caught me off guard was the story they were able to tell in such a short amount of time. Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated. I knew I would end up liking this movie, but this movie has completely exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy superheros or animation you should 100% definitely watch it in a theater.\nHelpful\n•\n407\n138\nvancewinstead (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur83657522/?ref_=tturv_usr_11_t)\nDec 15, 2018\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4512352/?ref_=tturv_perm_11)\n6\n/\n10\nGood fun, but overrated. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw10288098/?ref_=tturv_12)\n*Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* is often hailed as a game-changer, but is it really all that? Sure, the animation is incredible - it's unlike anything we've seen before, mixing comic book style with 3D in a way that feels fresh. But let's be honest, the hype surrounding it might be a bit much.\nThe story itself? It's decent but a bit all over the place. The whole idea of multiple Spider-People from different dimensions is cool at first, but it starts to feel crowded and a bit confusing. Instead of focusing on one solid story, it throws too much at you and doesn't quite know where to go with it all.\nMiles Morales, the film's lead, is a great character, but we don't really get to dive into his development as much as we should. The film's busy juggling other characters like Peter B. Parker and Spider-Gwen, but they don't really offer anything deep or groundbreaking either. They're fun, but we're left wanting more.\nAnd don't get me started on the pacing. The first half is solid, but by the time all the Spider-heroes show up, it starts to feel a bit rushed and chaotic. You almost lose track of why you're even invested in the story by the end.\nIt's not that *Spider-Verse* is a bad film - far from it. It's fun, colourful, and has moments of brilliance. But is it really the masterpiece some claim? Maybe not. It's definitely not as deep or well-rounded as some would have you believe. If you're into flashy visuals and light-hearted action, it's a good watch, but don't be fooled into thinking it's a revolutionary superhero flick.\nHelpful\n•\n3\n0\nSTWLCR (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur166020951/?ref_=tturv_usr_12_t)\nJan 27, 2025\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw10288098/?ref_=tturv_perm_12)\n5\n/\n10\nIt's just okay. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4696472/?ref_=tturv_13)\nThe visuals, while extremely ADHD are beautiful and help mask the usual uncanny valley physics that plague CGI heavy movies. That said, what is actually happening in some scenes is pretty vague, generally it's too busy.\nThe story telling is competent, when the writing isn't tripping over itself with overly concious lines, or progressive character tropes. At least unlike most such movies, the messaging doesn't entirely overtake the plot, and there is actual character development.\nAnd even with those progressive tropes, there is some messaging around courage, and tenacity, typical of heroic movies that are often absent in the more wish forfillment progressive typical story telling.\nAlthough for a hero origin movie, there is very little trace of self sacrifice, which is it's essential nature. Still, whilst it is somewhat hamfisted message fiction, they manage to wrap it into a plot that makes the film servicable and tucks the messaging into places where a less observant eye might miss it.\nIn general, it's safe to say this is pitched at kids. Which makes me not the target audience. It's neither good, nor bad, whilst the comic book graphic style in itself is worthy of some praise.\nHelpful\n•\n60\n77\ndrael64 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34242996/?ref_=tturv_usr_13_t)\nMar 3, 2019\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4696472/?ref_=tturv_perm_13)\n10\n/\n10\nSo Much More Than I Expected!

From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, \"This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman.\" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage.

I'll make a separate one for the film laterm I just feel like he deserves his own review. That's how great Peter is in this film.\nInto The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.\nI used to love Spiderman as a kid. I got obssessed with the cartoons he starred in as well as the original movie trilogy, one that actually helped me get interested in the character and marvel as a whole. But my love for this character, as most things, dissolved and it never got around to build itself up again, even after constant remakes and wonderful performances. I never felt that spark again, that love I felt for this charming dude was gone, dead.\nThen Into The Spider-verse came, and my whole world turned upside down. I felt a fire inside my stomach. There it was, that long-forgotten love for Peter Parker, one that I thought I would never experience again, expanding continuously as the movie progressed, hitting me in all the right places.\nI'd even dare to say that this movie made me understand the reason as to why spider-man is universally loved:\nHe's an everyday guy with super powers, that's it. He's flawed but pure at heart. He's relatable. He belongs to the people. He's one of us.\nThis movie's fresh take on Peter Parker is exactly what we needed to fully grasp that, how compelling this character can be without using any of his super powers. This version of Peter Parker is fat, subtly depressed, and tired, yet he's the most charming and lovable version of this character yet. It's something we haven't seen in quite a while, the genuine humanity that makes Peter Parker such a charismatic character, and one can only be thankful for it.\nSpider-man is cool again, but in a totally different, and perhaps even better, way. Just your everyday dude taking a leap of faith, giving the audience who relates to his struggles courage to do the same. This is what Spiderman can be and what he should be. A character that's ours, a character that teaches you that anyone can be a hero, that's the real Spiderman. This is the true Homecoming. Spiderman is freaking back!

The hype gave me pause but at the same time made me wait so that it had time to settle into reality. Coming to it outside of the hype and awards, I was open to what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. What pleased me was how creative it was in several areas of production. In terms of narrative it took the risk to be silly with its alternative Spider-Men, but was able to balance that with an engaging and reasonably serious core narrative. It managed to be funny, fun, engaging, and enjoyable all the way through.\nAnimation wise it mixed many styles and approaches very well. Even when it felt OTT with the visuals, it still somehow worked and I didn't feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload. The overall design of the film added to this, with good use of music, shot framing, and animation to make it feel very cool and fluid throughout. Production-wise, it felt like it \"got\" the sense of humour of the script and made that work more than it otherwise would have done. Voice performances also seem to get this, and everyone plays their characters well.\nOverall, it is creative, funny, engaging, and exciting for those that get into it and accept it on its own terms.\nHelpful\n•\n14\n7\nbob the moo (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tturv_usr_19_t)\nSep 22, 2019\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw5136932/?ref_=tturv_perm_19)\n6\n/\n10\nNicely animated but totally overhyped (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/review/rw4716042/?ref_=tturv_20)\nI really enjoyed the animation, the art and the music.

perfection. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, no doubt, and is by far the best animated movie ever created. The visuals are stunning, the characters are fantastic, the twist is somewhat predictable but still great, and the story is so touching. This is the best film I have ever seen, over Shawshank, over The Godfather, over The Matrix; this film is a godlike creation from the very, very best of cinema. Do not be fooled by the haters who say it is a poor portrayal of a tradition; the tradition is likely far more beautiful in Coco than in real life. Fantastic, I am blown away.\nHelpful\n•\n246\n54\nVuraxis (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur87974234/?ref_=tturv_usr_1_t)\nMay 3, 2018\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw4152853/?ref_=tturv_perm_1)\n8\n/\n10\nA Charming Depiction of a Beautiful Spanish-Language Tradition (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw4029309/?ref_=tturv_2)\nCoco tells the story of young boy named Miguel living in Mexico (Coco is his great grandmother). Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On Día de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family's ban on music.\nIn his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of Día de Muertos.\nOf course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it's beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel.\nQuick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about Día de Muertos. Sort of. I'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn't paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about Día de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes.\nIn high school, my understanding of Día de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly.\nIt's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It's about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture. Bravo!\nHelpful\n•\n147\n37\nJared_Andrews (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53660798/?ref_=tturv_usr_2_t)\nJan 10, 2018\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw4029309/?ref_=tturv_perm_2)\n9\n/\n10\nA Pure Delight! (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw4066588/?ref_=tturv_3)\nPixar has done it AGAIN! 'Coco' is a yet another delightful ride from the prolific animation studio, who's winning streak seems to never end. And that's good for all, since 'Coco' is all heart & soul, rewarding the moviegoer wholeheartedly.\n'Coco' Synopsis: Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.\n'Coco' captures the themes of Life & Death, with genuine feeling. Themes of family, passion, defeat & redemption also are explored here, but with humor & real emotion. While I laughed for a good share of this winning story, I also found myself weeping in the film's final-act. This is a true fantasy-adventure, that gives life & death true meaning.\nAdrian Molina & Matthew Aldrich's Screenplay is excellent. Lee Unkrich's Direction is colorful. And of course, the Animation is extraordinary. 'Coco' unfolds gorgeously & not for a second, does the pace drop.\nVocal-Performances are top-notch! Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, the protagonist, is a joy, Gael García Bernal s Héctor Rivera, a charming trickster in the Land of the Dead, Benjamin Bratt as Ernesto de la Cruz, the most famous musician in the history of Mexico and Miguel's idol & Ana Ofelia Murguía as Mamá Socorro \"Coco\" Rivera, Miguel's great-grandmother, stand out. And yes, this is a Film made in America about Mexicans & their tradition. Take That, Mr. President!\nOn the whole, 'Coco' deserves all your time & money. Don't Miss It. Oscars, are you ready?\nHelpful\n•\n66\n17\nnamashi_1 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8503729/?ref_=tturv_usr_3_t)\nFeb 18, 2018\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw4066588/?ref_=tturv_perm_3)\n10\n/\n10\nGracias Pixar (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw3845362/?ref_=tturv_4)\nIm Mexican and all i can say is Thanks you Pizax,I just saw this movie and i just remembered all my childhood with my grandparents, Mexico was represented beautifully,the music, the colors.

(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw3872461/?ref_=tturv_6)\nI have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.\nThough the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.\nCoco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like.

Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us.

Miguel is a nice little boy whose family, inexplicably, HATE music and insist he never can grow up to become a musician. And, wouldn't you know it, but that's EXACTLY what the boy wants to become one day. But after destroying his homemade guitar, he is unable to enter a music contest...so he decides to take one from the local cemetery. Not surprisingly, this creates all sorts of problems...and Miguel is transported to the land of the dead. What's next? Just see the film!\nThe CGI for this film is simply the best you'll currently find...putting it well above the quality of competing studios, such as Universal and Fox. In addition, the scope of the images is just breathtaking....and a treat to see on the big screen. Additionally, the songs, story and characters are all lovely.

A lush and lovingly made animation film based on the Dia de los Muertos theme from the Mexican culture, it is a touching experience and a joy to watch.\nHowever, after all the praise Coco received from all around, the actual viewing experience has left me slightly disappointed. Maybe because I did watch The Book of Life, another animation inspired by the Dia de los Muertos lore and featuring the similar \"family wishes vs personal destination\" conflict, a film some consider Coco to be a rip-off of. Or maybe it's because, despite all its pretty visuals, cute characters and singing solid enough, Coco clearly doesn't invest too much into having more than a single layer of meaning.\nYou see, here we have a painted prettily and with lots of fizzy buoyant quirks, but still a rather simplistic take on the eternal topic of love's duality and generations' conflict. A kid who loves music, but hatred for it is a family trait for several generations, so he embarks on an unexpected journey through the world of the dead to find a way to unite again what has once been separated and to mend what was once broken. And to sing a few songs and to battle some personal fears while he's at it. There are some nice and emotional scenes along the way, and some lessons learned for some characters, but it's still more or less a linear journey from A to B where good is mostly good (although not without a typical feminine touch of a raging maelstrom of emotionality), and bad is, well, at least clearly selfish from the get-go, and then it's plain outright evil.\nWhat is missing in my opinion is the multi-facet delivery, or at least a deeper morals of the story. Sure, \"love your relatives and do what you believe in\" is cool, but ain't it what every single animated film is eventually about? And you could reach the ending inevitable for such genre with some more convoluted and morally difficult effort than just being a boisterous music prodigy with tons of luck to his aid.\nIt's not a good idea to criticize art for not meeting your expectations. After all, nobody does it just for you, so why what you think must matter at all? Still, if you are not too fond of stories being rather straightforward, then Coco might feel somewhat shallow. And if you're not a kid who loves everything shiny and moving, then the second half of the film might feel kinda random, slapstick'y and, at times, on seriously heavy drugs (the color-changing monkey burping blue flames or multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya to drink an even more giant cactus' tears being some examples). For you, I might recommend watching The Book of Life instead, which, albeit arguably less glossy and vibrant visually, has a story much more complex and not stamping \"good\" and \"evil\" labels on things, thus showing the duality of people and of the life itself.\nFor everyone else, go ahead and watch this film. For its loving care for the Mexican traditions, sharing not just the language but also the passion for something outside the typical Western outlook. And clearly for the multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya - that was hilarious beyond all sane measure!\nHelpful\n•\n76\n103\nSemisonic (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur41574791/?ref_=tturv_usr_13_t)\nFeb 25, 2018\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw4073343/?ref_=tturv_perm_13)\n5\n/\n10\nNot as good as the reviews claim (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw3867374/?ref_=tturv_14)\nLeaving a review because I'm blown away at the amount of 9's and 10's I'm seeing for this movie, do you all have kids movies on a different scale?

So as a person that really puts his soul to a movie he watches I have to say that this film is one of the most beautiful things I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing.\nCoco does a fantastic job of capturing the viewer from the first moment. It cleverly captures the beauty of the \"Day of the Dead\" tradition, by unfolding one of the most heartwarming stories I've ever seen in a movie, around it. The film features a young Musician called Miguel and the pursuit of his dream of being a musician against his family's approval. Throughout the movie while Miguel engages in an adventurous journey through the land of the dead, he is caught between the love he has for music and the importance of family bonds. \nQuiet a simple and pretty well covered subject. Somehow, Coco manages to so simply and beatifully capture the essence of what it means to be human. What it means to love and what it means to have passion for the things and the people you love. The story was told in such an elegant way that it didn't make me think about the values it represented, but instead it made me feel them, without me even analysing what I was watching. It did it so gradually that at some point near the end I was so overwhelmed by a scene, which definetely goes to my \"top 10 best movie scenes\" list, that I caught myself crying. Not tearing up like I usually do when a scene touches me.

(Despite it's flaws) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw3846200/?ref_=tturv_22)\nCoco (2017) is an animated film co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina. It is a story set in the fictitious Mexican town of Santa Cecilia, where young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) embarks on a journey when his passion in life and dreams are called into question by his family. All Miguel wants from this life is emulating the great and famous singer Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt) but his abuela and relatives oppose. Miguel must come to terms with his family and return back home after he disrespects the \"dia de los muertos\" tradition and a curse falls upon him, trapping him with the dead. He finds help from the deceased Hector (Gael Garcia) and members of his family like Mama Imelda (Alana Ubach) as he finds a way to express his talents and learns family history.\nAt its core Coco is a story about passion, memory and family. Miguel follows a story arch where he must learn self value, bravery and the value of being true to one's self while remaining loyal to family, respecting tradition and remembering one's past in the form of family history. With a reputation for great storytelling, juggernauts Disney and Pixar have found a way to tell a story with such a worn arch with a new and authentic style. A lesson is learned by almost every main character as they grow and develop. Passion is pitted against tradition (and perhaps stubborn customs) and the outcome produces strong emotions on the viewer. At times the story felt carried itself with the drama and flair of a Mexican \"Telenovela\". These are some rich themes for what may be considered a \"kid's film\" but they develop organically and are never forced. However the film doesn't lack that slapstick humour or easy and quirky kid's comedy (Especially present in the playfulness of the dead characters' bones).\nThe production team made a respectable effort preparing for the production of this film, and the results were worthwhile and evident. The film is brilliantly set in Mexico, showcasing a wide range of customs and cultural icons that made the film feel authentic. Everything from Mexican cuisine (Like tacos, tamales or \"pan de muerto\") to celebrities (Like Frida Kahlo, El Santo, Pedro Infante or Cantinflas) make an appearance. Traditional \"Mariachi\" or \"Charro\" suits and elaborate woman hairstyles are accurately represented. Mexican family culture is accurately represented from the respect towards our loving, stern and kiss filling abuelas, to that spicy and sassy personality characteristic of Mexican and Latin women. Even the idolization of popular musical icons, similar to Ernesto de la Cruz in the film, resembles the decades old fascination with the likes of actual celebrities like Pedro Infante or Jose Alfredo Jimenez. I authentically felt the story was set in a real, picturesque Mexican pueblo. Every small detail felt in place and that enhanced the story. The film understands and respects the traditions of \"dia de los muertos\" while giving it a modern twist. Despite the difficulties, and risks, that come with portraying such a rich and complex culture the film makes a much appreciated effort in introducing a side of Mexican culture that is at times neglected in favour of easy-to-go stereotypes.\nThe film felt beautifully animated with intricate finger movements while playing a worn-out guitar or the miniscule pores and imperfections of the bones. Visually gorgeous and impressive the film makes use of a brightly coloured pallet, like with the rich orange used for the \"cempazuchitl\" flowers or the \"papel picado\" banners. The music fit perfectly with the tone used for the story and never stopped having a particularly Mexican flavour from the use of the guitar or trumpets to the \"marimba\". The score continued to set the story appropriately.\nCoco is carried by memorable fun moments, like Miguel's encounter with exotic Frida Kahlo, and beautiful and emotionally filled ones, such as that of the last act which grounded the story's themes of love for music and family during a scene that is sure to invoke a tear or two. Despite a few moments where it felt that the plot was driven by the oversimplified and unexplained mechanics of the curse, the film in general doesn't stop being the memorable and enjoyable experience of a familiar story executed with fresh and authentic style.\nHelpful\n•\n32\n45\njose_apou (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60883744/?ref_=tturv_usr_22_t)\nOct 30, 2017\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/review/rw3846200/?ref_=tturv_perm_22)\n10\n/\n10\nThe most beautiful movie.

Vibrant yet sombre, playful yet deeply emotional, it writes a narrative that balances joy and sorrow with remarkable precision. The story unfolds effortlessly, balancing the general kids' film aspect with a deeper storyline, and belonging into a journey that feels both intimate and grand.\nVisually, it is nothing short of breathtaking. The Land of the Dead is a spectacle, glowing marigolds, intricate cityscapes, and spectral figures that move with a fluidity only possible in animation. Despite not being the ideal audience for an animated children's movie, even I can admit this magic could not have been recreated if not drawn. Every frame is meticulously designed, making the world feel tangible despite its fantastical nature. While I usually lean towards live-action films, I can acknowledge that Coco is an example of animation at its peak, with artistry that speaks for itself.\nMusic is handled with restraint, and the musical-like aspects are well done. It enhances rather than dominates, allowing the narrative to take centre stage. Coco is undeniably crafted for a younger audience, yet its depth and clever writing ensure it resonates beyond childhood.

But what Coco is just yet another sad example of is that they've found their \"successful\" formula as well as they've settled into a certain safe way of doing everything. This is the same story we've seen a million times before: A kid has a dream for his future but is prevented to follow that dream because of the surroundings he lives in (in this case his family), and of course he goes on a journey that changes everything and he can eventually live this dream. This is basically A Bugs Life (and a million other similar stories) in a Mexican setting but without anything new and original added. The main plot twists where so super obvious that you spent half the film waiting for them to be revealed... Also all the structure around the story - the flow of the story, the supporting characters, the way it's animated, the many little slap-stick (supposedly) humorous elements - it all reeks of habits and \"let's just stay in our comfort zone and play it safe\".... And this from the company that gave us Toy Story 2 (my favourite in the series), Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, and Wall-E.\nPixar, I'm not angry but I'm extremely disappointed in the direction you've taken in later years.

It's a heart-warming tale with an uplifting message about kindness, featuring beautifully unique animation, interesting characters, and a clever plot.

It is a Christmas film, with the rights to be a classic one, for the wise way to explore the manner to become adult, the hate, the changes as result of the facts of one man, about dreams and purposes, interests, generosity and love.

(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/review/rw5361747/?ref_=tturv_9)\nA heartwarming, charming and gorgeous animated movie that retells Santa Clause's origin story in a new and interesting way, although it does stumble in some places, especially with it's familiar story that we've experienced before and hitting most of the same beats (but that doesn't mean that it didn't had great moments); some of the characters needed more development (like the schoolteacher Alva, who unfortunately comes out as a generic love interest, while still shines in some moments throughout the story), while others (the villains) can be considered average at best; music, which was 30% great, while the other 70% didn't stand out all that much or the composer is repeating the same music a couple of times and the dialogue was great and in some moments OK at best, which included jokes that weren't all that funny.\nThere is one thing that i want to mention: before i saw the movie, i read some reviews and saying that the main character Jesper has the same characteristics with a another existing character in a animated movie and that character was Kuzco from the movie \"The Emperor's New Groove\" and how they were too similar to each other. There is truth to that discussion, since Jesper starts out the same way and act the same way throughout the movie, but for me - he did grow on me the more and more i continue watching the movie and i started to separate him and Kuzco from one another and Jesper did stand on its own as a character.\nI'll just say it, since it's the most noticeable thing in the movie: i ADORE the animation. It's so gorgeous to look at. All of the designs of the characters, the environments, the movements of the characters and the lighting are just masterfully made and the cinematography accompanies it and making it jaw-dropping to look at. If that movie doesn't inspire you to become a animator, then i don't know what can.\nI'm so happy that people from around the world are still keeping the spirit of the traditional animation alive and proving to the huge corporate studios, who abandoned that technique of animation (i'm looking at you Disney), which existed for far long than we can remember is not dead and it doesn't give up on a fight. That doesn't mean that i don't adore the 3D / CGI animation that Pixar created (which i'm so grateful for that), which also creating a new way to tell stories, but it's sad that we only get 3D / CGI animated movies in the movie theater and the only way to see new traditional animated movies is on streaming services like Netflix or in festivals. Movies like \"Klaus\" still give me hope and that's a good thing. I'm giving \"Klaus\" a 7.4/10.\nHelpful\n•\n14\n7\nMartinito_08183 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65852172/?ref_=tturv_usr_9_t)\nDec 28, 2019\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/review/rw5361747/?ref_=tturv_perm_9)\n10\n/\n10\nA New Christmas Classic (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/review/rw5259068/?ref_=tturv_10)\nWhat a joy to watch!

Sometimes you have a film with glorious animation and an immersive story that challenges the viewer. Other times, you have silly animation that feels like it's only meant for the kids of the household under 10 years old. It's a tale of two halves and Klaus at the very least, ends on a touching note and finishes well overall.

The brilliant reflections that characters go thru during the run are surprisingly well-planned and executed, but then again, those overly gimmicky tropes in the plot make it seem like the writer was talented enough to avoid them and create something more original and sincere, but just decided not to. Very weird decisions were made here and I cannot fully approve them. An okay movie but nothing more.\nHelpful\n•\n14\n60\nHarhaluulo54 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32371134/?ref_=tturv_usr_14_t)\nJan 3, 2020\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/review/rw5378512/?ref_=tturv_perm_14)\n10\n/\n10\nMy Christmas watchlist just got a little longer (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/review/rw5310907/?ref_=tturv_15)\nEverything about this droll take on the Santa myth is inspired. JK SImmons as the title character, the animation style, the way in which the various elements of the mythos come together organically and so forth all just fit. Even the final moment of magical realism is just right. It all adds up to a heart warming tale of Christmas.\nI will be watching this each year for awhile.\nHelpful\n•\n87\n3\nCubsandCulture (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur83822756/?ref_=tturv_usr_15_t)\nDec 9, 2019\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/review/rw5310907/?ref_=tturv_perm_15)\n10\n/\n10\nClaus.

(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/review/rw5298368/?ref_=tturv_20)\n'Klaus (2019)' is essentially a demystified 'Santa Claus' origin story and it's as formulaic as you'd, perhaps, expect. It's also just delightful. Its predictability can't prevent it from being good and, boy, is it good. It's an enjoyable, effective and visually striking animation with a kind heart and a gentle spirit. It sidesteps the sloppy sentimentality usually associated with 'Christmas' movies in favour of, essentially, a subtler sort of the same thing. Its 'Christmas spirit' is strong but well-earned, sweet but not sickly. The movie is just a joy, in general. It's fun, fast-paced and aesthetically distinct, brought to life with a beautiful 2D-3D blend. It doesn't feel entirely typical, either, thanks to its endearingly strange setting and relatively well-realised characters. It makes a couple of very minor missteps - such as a second-act lull in pace and a slightly odd ending - but it's ultimately a thoroughly entertaining experience. 7/10\nHelpful\n•\n7\n5\nPjtaylor-96-138044 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26820801/?ref_=tturv_usr_20_t)\nDec 3, 2019\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/review/rw5298368/?ref_=tturv_perm_20)\n10\n/\n10\nBest Netflix animated yet?
