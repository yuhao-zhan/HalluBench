They give so much to help us, so we're giving them a big \"shout-out\" with our Volunteer of the Month feature.\n\nIntroducing our August Volunteer of the Month – Marina. The thing she likes best about volunteering for Colony Cats is getting to see the cats from when they first arrive sometimes scared or sick, to becoming healthy and happy, and finally when they get to go to their new home.\n\nMarina's advice for new Colony Cats volunteers is to be aware and inquisitive, and don't be afraid to ask questions. _[Click here](https://colonycats.org/documents/vomdocmarina.pdf) to read more and learn about Marina._\n\n![Image 3: picture of a black and white cat caption says Got Pests? Hire a Barn Cat](https://colonycats.org/images/barncat.jpg)\n\n### HIRE OUR BARNYARD GUARDIANS \n\nTO WORK FOR YOU!\n\nOur Barnyard Guardians are all-natural, pesticide-free, rodent controllers. Whether you have a barn, warehouse, brewery, horse farm, grainery, etc., these beautiful healthy cats are pros at keeping pesty critters from moving in.\n\nWe provide spayed/neutered, rabies vaccinated, feral/semi-feral cats. (We do ask that you take two for bonding.) You provide shelter, daily food/water (cats can't live on mice alone), and veterinary care as needed. Most importantly you provide a second chance at life for a pair of homeless cats who may have had a less fortunate future.\n\n_[Click Here](https://colonycats.org/documents/ccbarncats.pdf) to download our Barn Cats Information Flyer_ for more details. Print it out and share it with someone you know who might benefit from these helpers. If you have any questions, or are interested in barn cats _call 614-570-0471_ – leave a message and we will contact you – or _[click here to email.](mailto:volunteer@colonycats.org)_\n\n_Ready to adopt a pair of barn cats?_ _[Click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNQUHVVXoFWTZlsp6KX6Zdnx-WhR4-n47NRfm3dLFF4uyYqA/viewform?usp=sf\\_link)_ to fill out and submit our Barn Cat adoption application.\n\n![Image 4: Photo of cat with food dish that says uh-oh](https://colonycats.org/images/fixatfour.jpg)\n\n### PREVENT MORE. FIX AT MONTH FOUR.\n\nSpay and Neuter at 4-Months Old\n\nCats and dogs can get pregnant much sooner than you think. 50% of all pets born are accidents. _Spay or neuter your pet at four months old to help prevent those accidents_ and save millions from being killed in shelters each year. _[Click here](https://www.alleycat.org/our-work/spayneuter/)_ to read an _Alley Cat Allies_ article on why spay and neuter at 4 months old is so important. _[Click here](https://resources.bestfriends.org/article/understanding-spay-and-neuter)_ for a great article from Best Friends Animal Society about the importance of spay and neuter.\n\nColony Cats is excited to announce that we are a network partner of _[Best Friends Animal Society](http://bestfriends.org/What-We-Do/Our-Work/)_. Best Friends believes that collaboration with local pet shelters and animal rescue organizations – the people who know their communities best – is key to ending the killing in America’s shelters.\n\n_[Click here](https://colonycats.org/services.html#S1)to see our listing of local, low-cost spay/neuter resources._\n\n[![Image 5: Order your Pet Food at Chewy.com and Colony Cats (& dogs) will get a $20 donation!](https://cms-www.chewy.com/images/partners/rescue/banners/cw-shelter-200x200.png)](https://www.chewy.com/rp/7087)\n\n### ORDER FROM CHEWY.COM\n\n and Colony Cats Gets a Donation!\n\nHere's an easy way to help our organization _[– order your pet food at Chewy.com](https://www.chewy.com/rp/7087)_ and Chewy will proudly make a donation* of $20 to Colony Cats (& dogs)!
