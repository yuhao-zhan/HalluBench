His traditional name -- given to him as a young boy -- is Ta Sunke Wospapi (\"catches his horse\"); it befits a man who spends more time on his horses than anywhere else. As a Makes Room on his mother's side and a Brings Plenty on his father's, he is the stock of his grandfathers who fought at the Battle at Little Big Horn. Those familiar with the battle will know the strengths of those names and understand why Mo sees the world through the lens of the forces and sacrifices his family and ancestors made so that he could be here today. His relatives long passed are an intrinsic part of everything he does: every decision he makes and everywhere he goes.\nAs an actor, Mo is best known in his self-titled role as \"Mo Brings Plenty,\" Chief Thomas Rainwater's enforcer on the Taylor Sheridan/ViacomCBS record-breaking juggernaut series Yellowstone. Moviegoers can now catch him playing \"Shep Wauneka\" in the newly released Jurassic World Dominion (2022) and as \"Ottawa Jones\" in Showtime's Peabody award-winning limited series The Good Lord Bird (2021). He has played \"Crazy Horse,\" \"Sitting Bull,\" and many other historical Indian notables who have solidified their place in this Country's history. And he has spent a fair amount of time in the biopic world twice portraying Charlie Soap -- the husband of the first woman elected Chief of the Cherokee Nation, the late Wilma Mankiller-- in The Cherokee Word for Water and Gloria Steinem's The Glorias, respectively.\nMo Brings Plenty is an actor, horse stunt rider, rancher, and American Indian storyline consultant. But above all, he is a man who wholeheartedly believes in human kindness, and he trusts the good in humanity still exists and feels it just needs to be dusted off a bit. Out of respect and honor for those who have come before us, Mo knows we have a profound obligation to leave a livable planet for those who will follow after we are gone, and he starts and ends every day, with thoughts of how he and we can make the world a better place while we are here.\nWhen Mo isn't working as an actor, he can be found ranching or seeking ways to give back to his Lakota communities and Indian Country -- ways that include preserving culture, tradition and seeking cultural truth in diversity.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0414103/?ref_=ls_i_29)\n29.

She recalls being called \"Squaw\" at Bowness High School and bullied because of her parents' illness. In grade nine she changed schools and attended Calgary's Plains Indian Cultural Survival School. There she felt accepted for the first time. She learned about herself, her language, culture, singing and drumming. She remembers: \"They filled in a lot of the voids that my soul was just begging for.\"\nHer childhood hardships affected her profoundly. Though she acted in her first film at 17 with a role of Sally Littlefeathers in\nIsaac Littlefeathers (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087485/?ls)\n, it did not occur to her it could be a career. She planned to become a social worker and help children. She met\nGordon Tootoosis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0867588/?ls)\n, a First Nations actor, who told her: \"If [acting] is what your heart wants, you need to follow it and be true.\" At this point her parents were sober. With no other ties to Calgary, at age 20 she moved to Vancouver and found an agent.\nThrush has said it's been only the last 20 years that Indigenous people have been able to tell their truth through their own stories, though she credits such luminaries as\nTantoo Cardinal (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001987/?ls)\nand\nGraham Greene (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001295/?ls)\nfor kicking down the doors for Indigenous people in the industry.\nThrush has had a prolific career since its beginning in the 1980s.

She has performed the show, most often under the title Inner Elder, across Canada. It premiered at One Yellow Rabbit's High Performance Rodeo in Calgary in 2018 and has since been performed with Nightwood Theatre and Native Earth Performing Arts in Toronto (2019). Inner Elder is a structured monologue which recounts Thrush's personal life and experiences.\nDespite the credits and the awards, her desire to help children has never faded. In fact, she says acting has opened the door to helping in a way that social work could not. For the past 10 years, Thrush has traveled to aboriginal communities and shelters across Canada to perform as Majica, a therapeutic healing clown. Majica performs for young kids and teenagers, and also has a show for parents. \"Beyond film, my passion in life is working with our families and helping to defragment the damage that was done through residential schools to our families,\" she says. \"You cannot disconnect the child from the parent without huge damage being done. When it happens generation after generation, it destroys the family system.\"\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0033505/?ref_=ls_i_33)\n33.

While touring across the world, her namesake band was bestowed numerous awards including the Danish Crown Prince Couple's Stardust Award, Independent Music Award, and even a nomination for the Nordic Music Prize. Nive isn't just another indie rock sensation, though; she has also followed her passion to a career in film and TV.\nHer adventurous soul led Nive to pursue education far from her beloved Greenland, spending a year abroad in Spain before attending Red Cross Nordic United World College in Norway to participate in its international baccalaureate program. Nive eventually obtained her Bachelor of Arts in Politics from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, and then went on to attain her Master of Arts in Visual Anthropology from Goldsmiths College in the UK.\nWhile studying in Ottawa, Nive's friend and future bandmate Jan de Vroede encouraged her to assuage her boredom by playing the ukulele and writing some songs. Despite never having written or sung before, Nive took it as challenge and came back to Jan after a few weeks to play the song \"Room,\" which later became one of the first songs produced by Nive and The Deer Children. Fronted by Nive, the group debuted with its self-released album Nive Sings! in 2009. The album was a huge success and would go on to achieve gold status in Greenland - where one in 10 people there own it.\nThe band then toured extensively around the world, beginning with two incredible performances for dignitaries in the Selvstyre, Greenland's self-government, followed by another for the Queen of Denmark. They would then go on to become the first Greenlandic band to participate at the South By Southwest festival, Iceland Airwaves, Eurosonic, and Green Man. Due to the overwhelming success of Nive Sings!, the band landed a deal with Glitterhouse Records for a European release in 2012. Nive and The Deer Children soon returned with its second album, Feet First, originally released in 2016 and followed by extensive tours throughout Europe, North America, Japan, and South Korea.\nAfter completing her studies abroad, Nive returned home to work for Greenland National TV and radio as a researcher, segment producer, and, eventually, host. This experience led to roles on several locally produced shows and documentaries, as well as a small part in 2004's The New World starring Colin Farrell. Her music has since been included in several films, most notably Nuummioq, which was featured at Sundance International Film Festival.\nNive's adventurous nature stemmed from her earliest childhood experiences growing up in Greenland. She spent most of her youth in her tiny, snowy hometown of Nuuk. Solace was to be found in old music and worn-out books, being drawn into diaries about arctic exploration, contemporary art, and fishing. She would lose herself in the pages of Reif Larson, Calvin & Hobbs, Jim Harrison, and novels about infinite universes, time, space, and everything in between. Her passion for music was self-nurtured, built off a foundation of whatever records were in her reach. Having consumed music as diverse as her reading, Nive devoured albums by Michael Hurley, Jonathan Richman, Giant Sand, Bill Callahan, and Betty Lavette.\nNive will soon return to the studio with the band to begin work on the follow-up album to Feet First.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6136090/?ref_=ls_i_71)\n71.

But Duane did not come out of nowhere; he came from the streets.\nDuane Howard is a First Nation born in the Nuu-chah-nulth (meaning \"along the mountains and sea\") territory located on the west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. The Howard family left the territory when Duane was only 3 to live in the nearby town Port Alberni. By the time he moved to Vancouver with his older sister at the age of 14 following his parents' separation, Duane had already been using drugs and alcohol for four years.\nDuane lived on the streets from the age of 14 to 18 years old and had many close calls. Many times during this unimaginable period Duane considered not going on.\nAfter 13 years at the age of 23 Duane realized that he did not want his son to follow in his footsteps and so he simply got up and walked away from his dark life. Duane not only accomplished the enormous feat of becoming clean and sober, he went on to get his grade twelve education and in 1988 he received his diploma in Substance Abuse Counseling. Duane used his experience and his new education to work the rougher parts of Vancouver and towns across Canada making a difference in the lives of troubled youth and their families.\nIn the early 1990s Duane realized that he wanted to make another change in his life when he discovered a passion for acting. Duane began as a background performer and then worked his way up to acquiring a stunt credit on the feature film The Scarlett Letter. Duane's credits grew from stunts to stunt acting to acting roles on shows such as the TV movies Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and Goodnight for Justice: Queen of Hearts along with the popular TV series Arctic Air and more. Duane recently completed a starring role in a film titled The Sun at Midnight wherein, ironically, he fights to survive a bear attack.\nThat Duane ended up with the lead native role on The Revenant is nearly as miraculous as his survival on the streets. The actor had decided to take a break from the business a year before the audition call for the part of 'Elk Dog' came out, and it was upon hearing of the role from his former agent, that Duane returned to acting after initially accepting a stunt position on the film. Upon hearing of the film's frustration over finding the right actor for the integral role, the stunt coordinator who had hired Duane suggested that they take a look at him, as he knew what a strong actor Duane was. Unbeknownst to him, Duane's agent was working with Canadian casting director Michelle Allen to get him seen. Duane received a call the next day which was a Sunday, went in to read on the Monday and on Wednesday flew to Calgary and auditioned in private for the three time Oscar winner, Alejandro González Iñárritu. The director immediately took Duane down to the production facility and had him repeat his audition in front of the entire crew.

(\"PFI\"). PFI offers subsidized comprehensive and certified film production training programs for aspiring BIPOC storytellers to aid in pursuit of a career in the film and television industry.\nAs an Indigenous led company JBA recognizes inner city training may not be a viable option for aspiring Indigenous creatives in remote communities. This is why PFI puts a strong focus on forging pathways to connect remote Indigenous communities with the industry to provide the same offered training opportunities by traveling in and/or providing online instruction.\nJulian Black Antelope's commitment to his craft, cultural heritage, and fostering the next generation of Indigenous/BIPOC talent through his work on his own projects or through PFI make him an inspiring and influential figure in the entertainment world today.\nHe credits his sanity, strength and foundation to his spiritual commitment to his cultural practices and is forever grateful for the unwavering support from his wife Tracy and their three beautiful daughters, Sparrow, Emiko and Romin.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1248642/?ref_=ls_i_101)\n101.

Mirabal has twice been named the Native American Music Award's Artist of the Year, and has received the Songwriter of the Year award three times. He is also a two-time Grammy Award winner. His breakthrough PBS musical production, \"Music From a Painted Cave\", remains a benchmark of Native American traditional/rock fusion and storytelling.\nRobert Mirabal came of age in a traditional family that was broken apart by government relocation policies. \"I grew up with my grandparents and mom, an all woman family mostly. That was the classic thing in the '70s, a lot of relocation, children being taken from their homes by government and economics, marriages breaking up. I didn't have much connection with my father.\"\nGrowing up, Mirabal spoke the Tiwa language at home and to this day participates in the traditional ways and rituals of his people.\nMirabal remained in Taos to help care for his aging grandparents and went to the Indian school at the pueblo, where he picked up on an array of instruments: \"I learned clarinet, sax, piano, drums, anything I could get my hands on.\" he recalls. \"But it wasn't until I started playing flute at 18 that music took me over.\"\nBut Robert Mirabal is also a citizen of the world. He has performed around the planet with his band Rare Tribal Mob and a solo artist. He has collaborated with a diverse array of artists across a myriad of disciplines.\nMirabal has composed music for Japanese avant-garde modern dancers Eiko and Koma, garnering New York's Dance and Performance Bessie Award for the score.

Along with fellow Grammy-winning artist and Mohican nation singer-songwriter Bill Miller, he created the innovative work \"Native Suite: Chants, Dances and the Remembered Earth\". The project was both experimental and traditional, featuring flute and percussion as well as pow-wow singing. His groundbreaking band Mirabal featured rock bassist Mark Andes (Spirit, Heart), traditional percussion master Reynaldo Lujan, guitarist Andy York (John Mellencamp, John Fogerty) and acclaimed drummer Kenny Arnoff. Most recently, he has collaborated with Festival Ballet Albuquerque and their artistic director Patricia Dickinson along with legendary New York City Ballet dancer Jock Soto and, at Carnegie Hall, with German born multimedia environmental artist Sibylle Szaggars Redford in her ongoing work \"Way Of The Rain\".\nRobert's television credits include \"Yellowstone\" with Kevin Costner, \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" and feature films \"Woman Walks Ahead\" with Jessica Chastain, \"Georgia O'Keeffe\" with Joan Allen and Jeremy Irons.

Keanu Reeves (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206/?ref_=ls_t_1)\nActor\nProducer\nAdditional Crew\nThe Matrix (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/?ref_=ls_knf_1)\nKeanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means \"cool breeze over the mountains\" in Hawaiian, was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of\nPatric Reeves (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852983/?ls)\n, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu's father was born in Hawaii, of Native Hawaiian and Chinese ancestry while Keanu's mother is originally from Essex England. After his parents' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister,\nKim Reeves (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716238/?ls)\n, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was\nPaul Aaron (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007477/?ls)\n, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.\nAfter a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the\nRob Lowe (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000507/?ls)\nhockey flick\nYoungblood (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092272/?ls)\n, which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama,\nRiver's Edge (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860/?ls)\n, and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated\nDangerous Liaisons (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/?ls)\nwith director\nStephen Frears (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001241/?ls)\n.\nHis first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted \"Theodore\" Logan in\nBill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096928/?ls)\n. The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of\nRon Howard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/?ls)\n's comedy,\nParenthood (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098067/?ls)\nand\nLawrence Kasdan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001410/?ls)\n's\nI Love You to Death (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099819/?ls)\n.\nOver the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite\nRiver Phoenix (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000203/?ls)\n's narcoleptic male hustler in\nMy Own Private Idaho (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102494/?ls)\n, an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire's lair in\nDracula (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103874/?ls)\n, and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in\nMuch Ado About Nothing (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107616/?ls)\n.\nIn 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of\nSpeed (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/?ls)\n. Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like\nFeeling Minnesota (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116289/?ls)\nand\nThe Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119502/?ls)\n, and big films like\nA Walk in the Clouds (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114887/?ls)\nand\nThe Devil's Advocate (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971/?ls)\n. (There were a couple misfires, too:\nJohnny Mnemonic (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/?ls)\nand\nChain Reaction (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115857/?ls)\n.) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings' cyberadventure,\nThe Matrix (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/?ls)\n.\nNow a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them\nThe Replacements (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191397/?ls)\n,\nThe Watcher (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0204626/?ls)\n,\nThe Gift (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219699/?ls)\n,\nSweet November (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230838/?ls)\n, and\nHardball (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180734/?ls)\n- before\nThe Matrix Reloaded (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/?ls)\nand\nThe Matrix Revolutions (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/?ls)\nwere both released in 2003.\nSince the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with\nSomething's Gotta Give (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337741/?ls)\n,\nThe Lake House (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410297/?ls)\n, and\nStreet Kings (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421073/?ls)\n. He's kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as\nConstantine (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/?ls)\n,\nA Scanner Darkly (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/?ls)\n, and\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970416/?ls)\n. And he's waded back into art-house territory with\nEllie Parker (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436262/?ls)\n,\nThumbsucker (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318761/?ls)\n,\nThe Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1134629/?ls)\n, and\nHenry's Crime (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220888/?ls)\n.\nMost recently, as post-production on the samurai epic\n47 Ronin (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1335975/?ls)\nwaged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in\nSide by Side (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2014338/?ls)\n, a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project,\nMan of Tai Chi (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2016940/?ls)\n.\nIn 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film\nJohn Wick (2014) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2911666/?ls)\n, which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in\nJohn Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4425200/?ls)\n, taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.\nas\nJohnny Silverhand\nin\nCyberpunk 2077 (2020) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3810192/)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0586568/?ref_=ls_i_2)\n2.

The success in his home country includes\nFlickering Lights (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236027/?ls)\n,\nShake It All About (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273719/?ls)\nand the Emmy-winning police series\nUnit One (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0220261/?ls)\n.\nHis success has taken him abroad where he has played alongside\nGérard Depardieu (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000367/?ls)\nin\nI Am Dina (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281924/?ls)\nas well as in the Spanish comedy\nTorremolinos 73 (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339806/?ls)\nand the American blockbuster\nKing Arthur (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349683/?ls)\n.\nHe played the role of Dr. Hannibal Lecter in the critically acclaimed NBC series\nHannibal (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973/?ls)\n, from 2013 to 2015, with great success.\nas\nClifford Unger\nin\nDeath Stranding (2019) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5807606/)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005342/?ref_=ls_i_3)\n3.

He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theatre manager, in an artists' housing project in New York City's Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father's background, Diesel has said that he himself is \"definitely a person of colour\".\nHis first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin's fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York's hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel.\nFollowing high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called \"Feature Films at used Car Prices\" by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called\nMulti-Facial (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0226168/?ls)\n, which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000.\nMulti-Facial (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0226168/?ls)\nwas eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception.\nAfterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature,\nStrays (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149171/?ls)\n. Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call.\nSteven Spielberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/?ls)\nwas impressed by\nMulti-Facial (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0226168/?ls)\nand wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in\nSaving Private Ryan (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/?ls)\n.\nMulti-Facial (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0226168/?ls)\nearned Vin more work, when the director of\nThe Iron Giant (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129167/?ls)\nsaw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin's career steadily grew, with him securing his first lead role, as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film\nPitch Black (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134847/?ls)\n. The role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves.\nSince then, he has headlined a series of blockbusters, often but not only centered on fast-driving motor vehicles:\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0232500/?ls)\n,\nxXx (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295701/?ls)\n,\nThe Pacifier (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395699/?ls)\n,\nFast & Furious (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1013752/?ls)\n,\nFast Five (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596343/?ls)\n,\nFast & Furious 6 (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1905041/?ls)\n, and\nFurious 7 (2015) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2820852/?ls)\n.

In addition to reprising\nthe role in The Hobbit series, Wood also played Ryan\nin the FX television comedy\nWilfred (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1703925/?ls)\nand voiced Beck in the Disney XD animated television series\nTron: Uprising (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1812523/?ls)\n.\nElijah Wood possesses a remarkable and enduring career in entertainment, his initial rise to fame as Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson's iconic 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy merely the opening chapter. With a career beginning in childhood, he has proven both his longevity and his ability to transition from celebrated child actor to adult performer with a diverse range of roles across genres and mediums.\nWood's early filmography demonstrates his youthful promise. Films like 'Paradise' (1991), 'Radio Flyer' (1992), and the psychological thriller 'The Good Son' (1993) established him as a talented presence. Though starring in 'North' (1994) proved a critical misstep, his performance was often singled out as a bright spot. His exploration of more mature roles in 'The Ice Storm' (1997), 'Deep Impact' (1998), and 'The Faculty' (1998) showcased a growing versatility as Wood gracefully navigated the transition to young adult.\nThe 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy (2001-2003) transformed him into a global star. His heartfelt portrayal of Frodo Baggins, the humble hobbit burdened with the extraordinary task of destroying the One Ring, earned him widespread acclaim. Rather than remaining typecast following this success, Wood actively pursued challenging, offbeat roles that showcased his depth. He delivered a chilling performance as the sociopathic Kevin in 'Sin City' (2005) and lent his voice to both animation ('Happy Feet,' '9') and quirky television projects ('American Dad!,' 'Robot Chicken').\nBeyond notable film roles, Wood starred in the FX dramedy 'Wilfred' (2011-2014), with his portrayal of the troubled Ryan Newman earning critical praise. He continued voice work with roles in the 'Tron: Uprising' (2012-2013) animated series and the acclaimed miniseries 'Over the Garden Wall' (2014). Wood's work in more experimental films like 'Grand Piano' (2013) and 'Open Windows' (2014) demonstrates his continued desire to challenge himself with unconventional projects.\nBalancing both mainstream and independent cinema, Wood starred as a tormented writer in 'Maniac' (2012) while also reprising his role as Frodo Baggins in 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' (2012). He played the lead role in the BBC America series 'Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency' (2016-2017), where his portrayal of the endearingly eccentric Todd Brotzman brought him further recognition.\nAn avid music lover, Wood demonstrates his entrepreneurial side as the founder of the record label Simian Records. His interest in the production side of the entertainment industry led to the creation of the production company SpectreVision in 2010. Specializing in horror and genre films, SpectreVision has backed titles like 'Cooties' (2014), 'A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night' (2014), and the acclaimed 'Mandy' (2018).\nIn recent years, Wood has continued his eclectic filmography with parts in films like 'Come to Daddy' (2019), 'I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore' (2017), and 'Color Out of Space' (2019). He also voiced characters in the video games 'Broken Age' (2014) and '11-11: Memories Retold' (2018). He further expanded his production work with the VR game 'Transference' (2018).\nIn 2023, Wood appeared in Showtime's acclaimed series 'Yellowjackets,' and the crime thriller 'No Man of God' (2021), where his portrayal of real-life FBI profiler Bill Hagmaier marked another compelling dramatic turn. Projects in development include 'The Toxic Avenger,' a reboot of the cult classic, furthering Wood's penchant for the unusual and offbeat.\nElijah Wood's career underscores his dedication to diverse and challenging projects. He defies categorization, moving effortlessly between blockbuster franchises, independent cinema, voice acting, and production. His passion for storytelling and willingness to take creative risks demonstrate an artist continually evolving. Fans eagerly anticipate his future endeavors, a testament to his enduring talent and ability to captivate across a wide range of genres and mediums. 2007.\nas\nFrodo Baggins\nin\nThe Lord of the Rings (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387360/)\nvideo game series.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1083271/?ref_=ls_i_16)\n16.

He won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in\nThe Deer Hunter (1978) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077416/?ls)\n, and has been seen in mostly character roles, often portraying psychologically unstable individuals, though that generalization would not do justice to Walken's depth and breadth of performances.\nWalken was born in Astoria, Queens, New York. His mother, Rosalie (Russell), was a Scottish emigrant, from Glasgow. His father, Paul Wälken, was a German emigrant, from Horst, who ran Walken's bakery. Christopher learned his stage craft, including dancing, at Hofstra University & ANTA, and picked up a Theatre World award for his performance in the revival of the\nTennessee Williams (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931783/?ls)\nplay \"The Rose Tattoo\".

Her parents, despite Soviet restrictions on religious practices, instilled in her as much of their Jewish heritage as possible. Once in Los Angeles, she was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School. She struggled in school due to her lack of English skills and hyperactivity, which quickly led to a diagnosis of ADHD and a prescription for Ritalin-a medication she continues to take as an adult. She started acting when she was nine years old, when her father heard about an acting class on the radio and decided to enroll Mila in it. There, she met her future agent. Her first gig was when she played a character named Melinda in\nMake a Wish, Molly (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110444/?ls)\n. From there, her career skyrocketed into big-budget films.\nAlthough she is mostly known for playing Jackie Burkhart on\nThat '70s Show (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165598/?ls)\n, she has shown the world that she can do so much more.

The young Hopper expressed interest in acting from a young age and first appeared in a slew of 1950s television shows, including\nMedic (1954) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046623/?ls)\n,\nCheyenne (1955) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047720/?ls)\nand\nSugarfoot (1957) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050063/?ls)\n. His first film role was in\nRebel Without a Cause (1955) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048545/?ls)\n, quickly followed by\nGiant (1956) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049261/?ls)\nand\nGunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050468/?ls)\n. Hopper actually became good friends with\nJames Dean (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000015/?ls)\nand was shattered when Dean was killed in a car crash in September 1955.\nHopper portrayed a young\nNapoléon Bonaparte (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1927416/?ls)\n(!) in the star-spangled\nThe Story of Mankind (1957) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051016/?ls)\nand regularly appeared on screen throughout the 1960s, often in rather undemanding parts, usually as a villain in westerns such as\nTrue Grit (1969) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065126/?ls)\nand\nHang 'Em High (1968) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061747/?ls)\n. However, in early 1969, Hopper, fellow actor\nPeter Fonda (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001228/?ls)\nand writer\nTerry Southern (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0816143/?ls)\n, wrote a counterculture road movie script and managed to scrape together $400,000 in financial backing. Hopper directed the low-budget film, titled\nEasy Rider (1969) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/?ls)\n, starring Fonda, Hopper and a young\nJack Nicholson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/?ls)\n. The film was a phenomenal box-office success, appealing to the anti-establishment youth culture of the times. It changed the Hollywood landscape almost overnight and major studios all jumped onto the anti-establishment bandwagon, pumping out low-budget films about rebellious hippies, bikers, draft dodgers and pot smokers. However, Hopper's next directorial effort,\nThe Last Movie (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067327/?ls)\n, was a critical and financial failure, and he has admitted that during the 1970s he was seriously abusing various substances, both legal and illegal, which led to a downturn in the quality of his work. He appeared in a sparse collection of European-produced films over the next eight years, before cropping up in a memorable performance as a pot-smoking photographer alongside\nMarlon Brando (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ls)\nand\nMartin Sheen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000640/?ls)\nin\nFrancis Ford Coppola (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000338/?ls)\n's Vietnam War epic\nApocalypse Now (1979) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/?ls)\n. He also received acclaim for his work in both acting and direction for\nOut of the Blue (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081291/?ls)\n.\nWith these two notable efforts, the beginning of the 1980s saw a renaissance of interest by Hollywood in the talents of Dennis Hopper and exorcising the demons of drugs and alcohol via a rehabilitation program meant a return to invigorating and provoking performances. He was superb in\nRumble Fish (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086216/?ls)\n, co-starred in the tepid spy thriller\nThe Osterman Weekend (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086058/?ls)\n, played a groovy school teacher in\nMy Science Project (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089652/?ls)\n, was a despicable and deranged drug dealer in\nRiver's Edge (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860/?ls)\nand, most memorably, electrified audiences as foul-mouthed Frank Booth in the eerie and erotic\nDavid Lynch (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/?ls)\nfilm\nBlue Velvet (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090756/?ls)\n. Interestingly, the offbeat Hopper was selected in the early 1980s to provide the voice of \"The StoryTeller\" in the animated series of \"Rabbit Ears\" children's films based upon the works of\nHans Christian Andersen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0026153/?ls)\n!\nHopper returned to film direction in the late 1980s and was at the helm of the controversial gang film\nColors (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094894/?ls)\n, which was well received by both critics and audiences. He was back in front of the cameras for roles in\nSuper Mario Bros.

The enigmatic Hopper continued to remain busy through the 1990s and into the new century with performances in\nAll the Way (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320159/?ls)\n,\nThe Keeper (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364457/?ls)\nand\nLand of the Dead (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418819/?ls)\n.\nAs well as his acting/directing talents, Hopper was a skilled photographer and painter, having had his works displayed in galleries in both the United States and overseas. He was additionally a dedicated and knowledgeable collector of modern art and had one of the most extensive collections in the United States. Dennis died of prostate cancer on May 29, 2010, less than two weeks after his 74th birthday.\nas\nSteve Scott\nin\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314123/)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001786/?ref_=ls_i_20)\n20.

His mother was born in Sacramento to Japanese parents & his father was born in Japan. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, he & his family were relocated from Los Angeles to the Rohwer Relocation Center in Arkansas. Later, they were moved to a camp at Tule Lake in Northern California. His first-hand knowledge of the unjust internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans in World War II, poignantly chronicled in his autobiography, created a lifelong interest in politics & community affairs.\nAfter graduating from Los Angeles High School in 1956, he studied architecture at UC Berkeley. An ad in a Japanese community paper led to a summer job on the MGM lot where he dubbed 8 characters from Japanese into English for\nRodan (1956) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049782/?ls)\n. Bitten by the acting bug, he transferred to UCLA as a theater arts major.

He was the son of Harriette Fernette \"Fern\" (Miller) and Burton Milo Reynolds, who was in the army. After World War II, his family moved to Riviera Beach, Florida, where his father was chief of police, and where Burt excelled as an athlete and played with Florida State University. He became an All Star Southern Conference halfback (and was earmarked by the Baltimore Colts) before a knee injury and a car accident ended his football career. Midway through college he dropped out and headed to New York with aspirations of becoming an actor. There he worked in restaurants and clubs while pulling the odd TV spot or theatre role.\nHe was spotted in a New York City production of \"Mister Roberts,\" signed to a TV contract, and eventually had recurring roles in such shows as\nGunsmoke (1955) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047736/?ls)\n,\nRiverboat (1959) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052506/?ls)\nand his own series,\nHawk (1966) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059992/?ls)\n.\nReynolds continued to appear in undemanding western roles, often playing a character of half Native American descent, in films such as\nNavajo Joe (1966) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061587/?ls)\n,\n100 Rifles (1969) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063970/?ls)\nand\nSam Whiskey (1969) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064923/?ls)\n.

Reynolds (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4433664/?ls)\n(aka Quinton Anderson Reynolds), whom they adopted.\nHe was back on screen, but still the roles weren't grabbing the public's attention, until his terrific performance as a drunken politician in the otherwise woeful\nStriptease (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117765/?ls)\nand then another tremendous showing as a charming, porn director in\nBoogie Nights (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/?ls)\n, which scored him a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Like the phoenix from the ashes, Reynolds resurrected his popularity and, in the process, gathered a new generation of young fans, many of whom had been unfamiliar with his 1970s film roles. He then put in entertaining work in\nPups (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185101/?ls)\n,\nMystery, Alaska (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134618/?ls)\n,\nDriven (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132245/?ls)\nand\nTime of the Wolf (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307568/?ls)\n.

His sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. is seen by some as a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective \"John McClane\" in the monster hit\nDie Hard (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/?ls)\n, in which Willis' character single-handedly battled a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. He reprised the role of McClane in the sequel,\nDie Hard 2 (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099423/?ls)\n, set at a snowbound Washington's Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel\nDie Hard with a Vengeance (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112864/?ls)\n, this time co-starring\nSamuel L. Jackson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000168/?ls)\nas a cynical Harlem shop owner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in New York.\nWillis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice\nof \"Mikey\" the baby in the very popular family comedies\nLook Who's Talking (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097778/?ls)\n, and its sequel\nLook Who's Talking Too (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100050/?ls)\nalso starring\nJohn Travolta (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000237/?ls)\nand\nKirstie Alley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000263/?ls)\n.

He was the son of Baroness Maria Margareta (Rappe), a teacher, and Carl Wilhelm von Sydow, an ethnologist and folklore professor. His surname traces back to his partial German ancestry.\nWhen he was in high school, he and a few fellow students, including\nYvonne Lombard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0518337/?ls)\n, started a theatre club which encouraged his interest in acting. After conscription, he began to study at the Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school (1948-1951), together with\nLars Ekborg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252299/?ls)\n,\nMargaretha Krook (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0472234/?ls)\nand\nIngrid Thulin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862026/?ls)\n.

It was this last role that finally brought him recognition from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, when he was nominated as Best Actor in a Supporting Role, one of three Academy Award nominations he received in the 2010s, along with\nAll the Money in the World (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5294550/?ls)\n(as J. Paul Getty) and\nBeginners (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1532503/?ls)\n; he won for the latter role. He will also likely always be remembered as Captain Von Trapp in the atomic bomb-strength blockbuster\nThe Sound of Music (1965) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/?ls)\n, a film he publicly despised until softening his stance in his autobiography \"In Spite of Me\" (2008).\nChristopher Plummer was born Arthur Christopher Orme Plummer on December 13, 1929 in Toronto, Ontario. He was the only child of Isabella Mary (Abbott), a secretary to the Dean of Sciences at McGill University, and John Orme Plummer, who sold securities and stocks. Christopher was a great-grandson of John Abbott, who was Canada's third Prime Minister (from 1891 to 1892), and a great-great-great-grandson of Presbyterian clergyman John Bethune. He had Scottish, English, Anglo-Irish, and Cornish ancestry. Plummer was raised in Senneville, Quebec, near Montreal, at his maternal grandparents' home.\nAside from the youngest member of the Barrymore siblings (which counted Oscar-winners\nEthel Barrymore (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000856/?ls)\nand\nLionel Barrymore (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000859/?ls)\nin their number), Plummer was the premier Shakespearean actor to come out of North America in the 20th century. He was particularly memorable as Hamlet, Iago and Lear, though his Macbeth opposite\nGlenda Jackson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413559/?ls)\nwas -- and this was no surprise to him due to the famous curse attached to the \"Scottish Play\" -- a failure.\nLike another great stage actor,\nRichard Burton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000009/?ls)\n, early in his career Plummer failed to connect with the screen in a way that would make him a star. Dynamic on stage, he didn't succeed as a younger leading man in films. Perhaps if he had been born earlier, and acted in the studio system of Hollywood's golden age, he could have been carefully groomed for stardom. As it was, he shared the English stage actors' disdain -- and he was equally at home in London as he was on the boards of Broadway or on-stage in his native Canada -- for the movies, which did not help him in that medium, as he has confessed. As he aged, Plummer excelled at character roles. He was always a good villain, this man who garnered kudos playing Lucifer on Broadway in\nArchibald Macleish (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0533831/?ls)\n's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"J.B.\".\nPlummer won two Emmy Awards out of seven nominations stretching 46 years from 1959 and 2011, and one Genie Award in six nominations from 1980 to 2009. For his stage work, Plummer has racked up two Tony Awards on six nominations, the first in 1974 as Best Actor (Musical) for the title role in \"Cyrano\" and the second in 1997, as Best Actor (Play), in \"Barrymore\". Surprisingly, he did not win (though he was nominated) for his masterful 2004 performance of \"King Lear\", which he originated at the Stratford Festival in Ontario and brought down to Broadway for a sold-out run. His other Tony nominations show the wide range of his talent, from a 1959 nod for the\nElia Kazan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001415/?ls)\n-directed production of Macleish's \"J.B.\" to recognition in 1994 for\nHarold Pinter (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0056217/?ls)\n's \"No Man's Land\", with a 1982 Best Actor (Play) nomination for his \"Iago\" in\nWilliam Shakespeare (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000636/?ls)\n's \"Othello\".\nUntil the 2009 Academy Awards were announced, it could be said about Plummer that he was the finest actor of the post-World War II period to fail to get an Academy Award. In that, he was following in the footsteps of the late great\nJohn Barrymore (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000858/?ls)\n, whom Plummer so memorably portrayed on Broadway in a one-man show that brought him his second Tony Award. In 2010, Plummer finally got an Oscar nod for his portrayal of another legend,\nLev Tolstoy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0866243/?ls)\nin\nThe Last Station (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824758/?ls)\n. Two years later, the first paragraph of his obituary was written when the 82-year-old Plummer became the oldest person in Academy history to win an Oscar. He won for playing a senior citizen who comes out as gay after the death of his wife in the movie\nBeginners (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1532503/?ls)\n. As he clutched his statuette, the debonaire thespian addressed it thus: \"You're only two years older than me darling, where have you been all of my life?\"\nPlummer then told the audience that at birth, \"I was already rehearsing my Academy acceptance speech, but it was so long ago mercifully for you I've forgotten it.\" The Academy Award was a long time in coming and richly deserved.\nPlummer gave many other fine portrayals on film, particularly as he grew older and settled down into a comfortable marriage with his third wife Elaine. He continued to be an in-demand character actor in prestigious motion pictures. If he were English rather than Canadian, he would have been knighted. (In 1968, he was appointed Companion of the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian honor and one which required the approval of the sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II.) If he lived in the company town of Los Angeles rather than in Connecticut, he likely would have several more Oscar nominations before winning his first for \"The Last Station\".\nAs it is, as attested to in his witty and well-written autobiography, Plummer was amply rewarded in life. In 1970, Plummer - then a self-confessed 43-year-old \"bottle baby\" - married his third wife\nElaine Taylor (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852327/?ls)\n, a dancer, who helped wean him off his dependency on alcohol. They lived happily with their dogs on a 30-acre estate in Weston, Connecticut. He thanked her from the stage during the 2012 Oscar telecast, quipping that she \"deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for coming to my rescue every day of my life.\" Although he spent the majority of his time in the United States, he remained a Canadian citizen. He died in his Weston, Connecticut home on February 5, 2021 at age 91.\nHis daughter, with actress\nTammy Grimes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342245/?ls)\n, is actress\nAmanda Plummer (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001625/?ls)\n.\nas\nArngeir\nin\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1814884/)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000579/?ref_=ls_i_32)\n32.

His parents were both from Jewish families (from Hungary, Germany and Poland).\nWith a career spanning over three decades, Perlman has worked alongside such diverse actors as\nMarlon Brando (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ls)\n,\nSean Connery (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125/?ls)\n,\nDominique Pinon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0684500/?ls)\n,\nBrad Dourif (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000374/?ls)\n,\nEd Harris (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000438/?ls)\n,\nJohn Hurt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000457/?ls)\n,\nJude Law (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000179/?ls)\n,\nChristina Ricci (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000207/?ls)\n,\nFederico Luppi (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0527002/?ls)\n,\nSigourney Weaver (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000244/?ls)\n,\nMichael Wincott (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000699/?ls)\nand\nElijah Wood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000704/?ls)\nto name a few.\nWhile he has never been a bankable star, Perlman has always had a large fan-base. He started out strong as Amoukar, one of the tribesmen in\nJean-Jacques Annaud (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000269/?ls)\n's Academy Award-winning film\nQuest for Fire (1981) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082484/?ls)\n, for which he earned a Genie Award nomination. Perlman teamed up with Annaud again, this time as a hunchback named Salvatore in\nThe Name of the Rose (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091605/?ls)\n. His first real breakthrough came later when he landed the role of the noble lion-man Vincent, opposite\nLinda Hamilton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000157/?ls)\non the fantasy series\nBeauty and the Beast (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092319/?ls)\n. His work in this role earned him not only a Golden Globe Award but an underground fan following. Sadly the series was canceled in its third season shortly after Hamilton's character's death.\nAfter that, he spent time doing supporting work on television and independent films such as\nGuillermo del Toro (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868219/?ls)\n's debut\nCronos (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104029/?ls)\n(where a lifelong friendship and collaboration between the director and Perlman would blossom) as Angel and his first lead role as One in\nJean-Pierre Jeunet (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000466/?ls)\n's surreal\nThe City of Lost Children (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112682/?ls)\n. His first real big role in a mainstream film came when Jeunet wanted him for the brutish Johner in his first Hollywood outing\nAlien: Resurrection (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118583/?ls)\n. Perlman has also used his distinctive voice to his advantage, appearing in many animated films/series, commercials and he is a video game fan favorite because of his work on such games as the Fallout series.\nIt was not until much later he received worldwide fame when his good friend\nGuillermo del Toro (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868219/?ls)\nhelped him land the title role in the big-budget comic book movie\nHellboy (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167190/?ls)\n. Del Toro fought the studio for four years because they wanted a more secure name, but he stood his ground and in 2004, after almost 25 years in and out of obscurity, Perlman became a household name and a sought out actor. Perlman has had one of the most offbeat careers in film, playing everything from a prehistoric ape-man to an aging transsexual and will always be a rarity in Hollywood.\nOther notable roles include the cunning Norman Arbuthnot in\nThe Last Supper (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113613/?ls)\n, sniper expert Koulikov in\nEnemy at the Gates (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215750/?ls)\n, vampire leader Reinhardt in\nBlade II (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187738/?ls)\n, his reprisal of Hellboy in\nHellboy II: The Golden Army (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411477/?ls)\nand biker chief Clarence Morrow on the popular series\nSons of Anarchy (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124373/?ls)\n.\nHe currently resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, Opal, and their two children, Blake and Brandon.\nThe Narrator\nof\nFallout (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4741306/)\nseries.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0799777/?ref_=ls_i_33)\n33.

Hauer was born in Breukelen, a Dutch town and former municipality in the province of Utrecht.\nHe was the son of\nTeunke Hauer (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3968509/?ls)\n(née Mellema) and\nArend Hauer (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0369212/?ls)\n, actors who operated an acting school. As his parents were often touring, he and his three sisters were raised by a nanny. A bit of a rebel during his childhood, he chafed at the rules and rigors of school and was often getting into mischief. His grandfather had been the captain of a schooner and at age fifteen, Hauer ran away to work on a freighter for a year. Like his great-grandfather, Hauer was color-blind, which prevented him from furthering his career as a sailor.\nUpon his return he attended night school and started working in the construction industry. When he again bombed at school, his parents enrolled him in drama classes. An amateur poet, he spent most of his time writing poetry and hanging out in Amsterdam coffee houses instead of studying. He was expelled for poor attendance and afterward spent a brief period in the Dutch navy.\nDeciding he didn't like military life, Hauer honed his acting skills trying to convince his superiors he was mentally unfit and was sent to a special home for psych patients. It was an unpleasant place, but Hauer remained there until he had convinced his ranking officers that the military really did not need him.\nas\nMaster Xehanort\nin\nKingdom Hearts III (2019) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2973418/)\nMore to explore\nFeedback\nTell us what you think about this feature.

Jacob) has enjoyed a multi-faceted career on the music side of the entertainment industry, spanning 40 years and encompassing award-winning feature films, collaborations with number of legendary musical artists, and her own Grammy® nomination.\nThroughout it's first seven years, Elton held the post of DreamWorks Senior Vice President of Music, where she oversaw both the creative and corporate aspects of the music and songs for the studio's animated feature films. She joined the studio in 1995, shortly after its inception, and, as its first music executive, developed the feature film music department virtually from the ground up.\nElton went on to serve as Artistic Director of Music for seven DreamWorks' animated features, including the computer animated blockbuster Shrek, which won the first-ever Academy Award® for Best Animated Feature. In addition, Elton was honored with a Grammy® Award nomination (shared with Michael Ostin) in the category of Best Compilation Soundtrack for her work as Producer on the film's multi-platinum-selling soundtrack album. Always within arm's reach of Hollywood, Elton and her longtime partner, guitarist, and three-time Emmy® nominated composer Danny Jacob, have their own music production company Marquand Music, Inc. These productions include Disney's TV animation mega-hit, Phineas and Ferb, as well as producing numerous songs for Disney's TV animation division's Sofia the First, Elena of Avalor and Tangled. Joining the organization is their son, NYU and Chapman University film graduate, Aaron Jacob, as composer, music editor and featured vocalist.\nDuring her tenure at DreamWorks, Elton was the Co-Producer of Vocals (shared with composer Hans Zimmer) on the epic musical drama The Prince of Egypt, which won the Oscar for Best Song for \"When You Believe\". The soundtrack for the film also featured Broadway's Brian Stokes Mitchell performing \"Through Heaven's Eyes\". On the morning of February 28, 2011, at the request of the astronaut's families, this song was broadcast to wake up the Discovery shuttle crew on their last voyage. Other animated projects on which Elton oversaw the music include Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, featuring songs by Bryan Adams; and The Road to El Dorado, which marked the reunion of the Oscar-winning \"The Lion King\" team of Elton John, Tim Rice, and Hans Zimmer; as well as the animated hits Chicken Run and Antz in addition to feature films Peacemaker and Gladiator.\nRaised in Los Angeles, Elton began her career in 1978 at A&M Records where she managed album-recording costs for their many artists. Soon after, she struck out on her own as an independent coordinator and worked on more than 20 albums for such artists as Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, Rod Stewart, Bob Weir, and Duran Duran's Andy Taylor. Having maintained relations with mentor Diana Ross, Elton was Co-Executive Producer on Ross' CD \"I Love You\" released in 2009. As the advent of MTV put a greater emphasis on the visual aspects of the music industry, soundtrack albums were also enjoying greater success, often spawning chart-topping singles. Segueing into the film industry, Elton supervised songs for such movies as Ivan Reitman's comedy smash \"Ghostbusters\", David Lynch's \"Wild at Heart\"; and James L. Brooks' 1994 film \"I'll Do Anything.\"\nIt was on the last that Elton first worked with composer Hans Zimmer and producer Penney Finkelman-Cox, who were responsible for bringing Elton to DreamWorks the following year.\nIn 2011, Elton established the first endowment for the Teenage Drama Workshop at California State University Northridge, the longest running teen theater program in the nation. Relocating to Jacksonville, Oregon in 2014, Elton continues her legacy as a patron of the arts, supporting the Collaborative Theater Project, when in 2023, she accepted the honor being on its Board of Directors.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2115032/?ref_=ls_i_56)\n56.

His dad owned a club on Long Island and showcased local bands on the weekends.\n\"I would drive from Philadelphia to New York every weekend to audition new bands. I knew music was going to be my eventual path, not drilling and filling!\"\nWhen Billy Joel came into the club and auditioned, I knew immediately that he was a unique and special talent. Irwin left dental school to begin his management foray into the world of music, with an undeniable belief that Billy Joel could be a super star,\nMazur spent the years of 1966 to 1972 managing, nurturing, and giving confidence to a singer songwriter whose talent and career has now been applauded for over 50 years.\nMazur says, 'although I never had a chance to sit back and bask in Billy's success, I have always taken great pride in recognizing an acorn of talent that would grow to be a giant oak tree\"\nIt was an important lesson, as Irwin would come to understand in life.\nMazur's management career continued after Billy, and although he put his formidable management skills behind some very gifted artists, it became apparent that although talent and tenacity are vital, sometimes timing can be most important.\nHis next dip into music business waters was when he was chosen to take the seat of Senior Vice President for April Blackwood Music/C.B.S. Songs. There he championed music for the publishing giant from 1977 to 1982 with great success.\nAs popular music was playing a great part in the making of movies, Mazur saw a new musical niche and started up a music supervision company, Cine Music. With early success providing contemporary songs into films like, Ghostbusters, and many others, a significant downturn came when movie companies began having in house music supervision that finally led to the beginning of a new career for a man ready for change.\nIn 1988, at 46 years old Irwin Mazur traded in his musical background for a career that he believed might give him more stability and hopefully less frustration, oddly enough, the\n\"Stock Market\".\nAs it turned out his good reputation in the entertainment business attracted many big-name clients and brokerage firms. Finally, Irwin began to thrive in an environment that respected and rewarded honesty, integrity, and reliability. He has spent his second career in an exciting and even though it can be unpredictable, more reliable road. Still a great fan of music, he loves it listens to it, but doesn't depend on it.\nBy the way, Irwin's son Bret Mazur is very much involved in the business of music\n....and he loves it!\nTo this day, Irwin, and his wife of 50 years, Jackie, navigate a life that they have built.\nEnjoying a wonderful family, lots of friends and many good times. As Irwin Mazur approaches 80 years old he smiles and says, \"life's ups and downs teach us all a lot about living as best we can while we can.\"\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0570408/?ref_=ls_i_112)\n112.

He has built a sterling reputation for mining gold and platinum records for a bevy of major recording stars and record labels including Quincy Jones, Anita Baker, the late Michael Jackson and Teddy Pendergrass, Grand master Flash, Pete Rock, C.L. Smooth, Tevin Campbell, Elektra Records, Qwest Records, and MCA Records, to name just a few.\nRaoul's passion and ears for music are deeply rooted in his family's lineage and late father, the iconic and internationally revered jazz musician Max Roach. He was born and raised in New York City, and by age 15, was cutting his teeth working for his legendary dad, first as an office assistant, then a roadie, and eventually as his Road Manager and producer of several of his concerts. Roach was also firmly entrenched in activism, civil rights and the social justice movement of the sixties and seventies, so Raoul was exposed to and mentored by some of the most pivotal Black figures of the period including Maya Angelo, Sonia Sanchez, Amiri Baraka and Alvin Ailey.\nHe initially enrolled at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA where he majored in Electronic & Computer Engineering, and also participated in organizing rallies and protests for change at UMass and other regional colleges and universities. However, after his junior year, he took a year sabbatical, shifted away from engineering and enrolled in an Arts Marketing Program at SUNY Purchase. Upon completion of the academic program at SUNY, he landed a gig as a booking agent for O'Gilvie Management Associates, booking R&B and Jazz tours in Europe and North America. During his tenure there, he had a chance meeting with Wynton Marsalis at the North Sea Jazz Festival in The Hague, Holland, which led to him being hired as the Grammy Award-winning artist's Road Manager.\nIn the early eighties, Raoul opted to take his burgeoning talents to Los Angeles. His first break was scoring an internship with Quincy Jones Music Publishing Company. Jones later hired him as his personal production assistant and driver. During his tenure under Jones' tutelage, he was intimately involved in numerous music and film projects Jones helmed, most notably the production of \"The Color Purple\" directed by Steven Spielberg, and Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" album.\nHis first major record executive appointment came as National Director Black Music A&R for Elektra Records. He hit the ground running scoring his first number one platinum selling hit with Keith Sweat's \"I Want Her,\" produced by Teddy Riley, ushering in a new R&B sound called \"New Jack Swing\", and netting top-selling singles/albums by Anita Baker, Teddy Pendergrass, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and many others. He's also credited with signing the first \"Dancehall\" artist, Jamaican Rapper \"Shinehead\" to a major record label.\nQuincy Jones then pursued Raoul to resurrect his then defunct and debt-ridden Qwest Records label. He accepted the offer and in a less than a year erased the label's debt and turned the company into a hit-making and profitable machine (generating over $70 million in record sales). Under Raoul's leadership, Qwest successfully launched newcomers Tevin Campbell and Keith Washington, releasing Quincy's own record breaking \"Back on the Block\" singles, as well as feature film soundtracks for: Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X\", John Singleton's \"Boyz 'N Da Hood and Nora Ephron's directorial debut \"This Is My Life\" with Carly Simon. Raoul was later lured by UMG/MCA records to serve as Senior VP of its' Black Music A&R department, where he managed recordings for some 40 artists and a $75 million budget.\nRaoul then became involved as an executive in a number of Internet/Entertainment start-ups and worked as an independent consultant for new and established artists, recording labels and media ventures. Most recently he was involved in the launching of Harry Belafonte's social justice entertainment enterprise, Sankofa.org and served as the organization's Co-Executive Director. There he helped to raise over $1,000,000 for operations, executive produced social justice charity recordings from John Legend, Usher, Sting, Mali Music, Ty Dollar Sign, TI, NeYo, Aloe Blaac, & Nas, Co-Executive Produced the \"Many Rivers To Cross Festival\" a music, art and social justice festival in Chattahoochee Hills, GA (Atlanta) in 2016. The Festival featured John Legend, Common, Dave Matthews, Santana, Public Enemy, Goapele, Robert Glasper, Sweet Honey In The Rock and and many others, as well as activists from around the country.\nCurrently semi-retired, he is working with family and other collaborators of his late father, to coordinate #MaxRoach100, an 18 month international centennial celebration of his father's music and life. #MaxRoach100! will include films, documentaries, social media, concerts, exhibitions and new and previously released recordings. Max Roach was born, January 10, 1924.\nRaoul currently resides in NYC and is the proud father of two boys, Kyle, and Kadar.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734641/?ref_=ls_i_141)\n141.

Brett worked with a diverse roster of talent including Fleetwood Mac, Bob Dylan, The Simpsons, Richie Sambora, Taylor Dane, Vonda Shepard and Andrew Dice Klay.\nFollowing this period, Buddy Brundo and Rose Mann-Cherney at Conway Recording Studios brought Brett in as an engineer on numerous projects from The YellowJackets, Bob Seger, Ringo Starr, Jan Arden, Aaron Neville, Emerson Lake and Palmer and Exposé. Here, he finally gained entrée into the film world with his work on Cry Baby as well as Arif Mardin's and Bette Midler's For The Boys.\nNext, as house engineer at O'Henry Studios, Swain was on countless albums but also found that his interest in film and television music was blossoming. In addition to working on albums for Prince, Herbie Hancock, Caifanes, Andraé Crouch and Crosby, Stills and Nash, he engineered on such films as Mortal Combat, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, That Thing You Do; and on television's Matlock, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, The Simpsons and Lost.\nBrett's work at O'Henry, garnered the attention of a Walt Disney company executive who invited him to be a music supervisor at the studio. He leapt at the opportunity and spent over 16 years at the Walt Disney company as Director of Music production. During his time at Disney he was also promoted to Vice President of the Music, Casting and Post Production divisions of DisneyToon studios working on over 50 animated productions.\nBrett loves the challenge of his position as it allows him to play a role in every facet of each film's music from managing the music budgets of multi-million dollar films, to identifying song moments at the script stage. Plus, he's surrounded by music all day long and gets to hire the songwriters, singers and composers, booking musicians in some of the very studios where he began his career.\nWhen not at work, Brett shares his love of music with his wife and two kids at their home in Los Angeles.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12655507/?ref_=ls_i_166)\n166.

He featured in the music video for\nThe Buggles (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1477902/?ls)\n' single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which became a worldwide hit and helped usher in a new era of global entertainment as the first music video to be aired on MTV (August 1, 1981).\nHans Florian Zimmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, then in West Germany, the son of Brigitte (Weil) and Hans Joachim Zimmer. He entered the world of film music in London during a long collaboration with famed composer and mentor\nStanley Myers (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004368/?ls)\n, which included the film\nMy Beautiful Laundrette (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091578/?ls)\n. He soon began work on several successful solo projects, including the critically acclaimed A World Apart, and during these years Zimmer pioneered the use of combining old and new musical technologies. Today, this work has earned him the reputation of being the father of integrating the electronic musical world with traditional orchestral arrangements.\nA turning point in Zimmer's career came in 1988 when he was asked to score Rain Man for director\nBarry Levinson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001469/?ls)\n. The film went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year and earned Zimmer his first Academy Award Nomination for Best Original Score. The next year, Zimmer composed the score for another Best Picture Oscar recipient,\nDriving Miss Daisy (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097239/?ls)\n, starring\nJessica Tandy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788/?ls)\n, and\nMorgan Freeman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/?ls)\n.\nHaving already scored two Best Picture winners, in the early 1990s, Zimmer cemented his position as a preeminent talent with the award-winning score for\nThe Lion King (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/?ls)\n. The soundtrack has sold over 15 million copies to date and earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Score, a Golden Globe, an American Music Award, a Tony, and two Grammy Awards.

With state-of-the-art technology and a supportive creative environment, Zimmer was able to offer film-scoring opportunities to young composers at his Santa Monica-based musical \"think tank.\" This approach helped launch the careers of such notable composers as\nMark Mancina (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006183/?ls)\n,\nJohn Powell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0694173/?ls)\n,\nHarry Gregson-Williams (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004581/?ls)\n,\nNick Glennie-Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322684/?ls)\n, and\nKlaus Badelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0046004/?ls)\n.\nIn 2000, Zimmer scored the music for\nGladiator (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/?ls)\n, for which he received an Oscar nomination, in addition to Golden Globe and Broadcast Film Critics Awards for his epic score. It sold more than three million copies worldwide and spawned a second album Gladiator: More Music From The Motion Picture, released on the Universal Classics/Decca label.
