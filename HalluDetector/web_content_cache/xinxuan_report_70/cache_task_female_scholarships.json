  "https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-overview": "Title: Discover Scholarships for Computer Science Majors\n\nURL Source: https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-overview\n\nPublished Time: 2022-03-07T22:27:25+00:00\n\nMarkdown Content:\nComputer science scholarships offer a debt-free way to reduce the financial burdens of higher education. However, students often feel daunted by the sheer number of available scholarships.\n\nMany funding programs also have narrow eligibility requirements. As a result, students often invest a lot of time and effort to identify only a handful of suitable funding opportunities.\n\nThis guide to computer science scholarships offers helpful tips on sourcing scholarships, preparing applications, and planning your higher education funding. It also highlights a wealth of funding programs for undergraduates, graduates, and population groups that have historically been underrepresented in tech.\n\n[](https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-overview)\nApplying for computer science scholarships differs from college applications. Deadlines, eligibility requirements, awards, and required documents vary greatly between sponsor organizations. Students must take a proactive approach to ensure they do not miss scholarship opportunities:\n\n*   **Start research early:**Many organizations open the application window in January or February for the upcoming school year. However, others begin accepting applications much earlier — sometimes in the summer. That means students should begin researching scholarship opportunities about a year in advance.\n*   **Broaden the scholarship search:**Searching for computer science scholarships can yield numerous results, but applicants can find even more opportunities by searching for identity- and merit-based scholarships. For example, many organizations offer scholarships for women and minority students, regardless of their major.\n*   **Make a list of applicable scholarships:**While researching, students should note the eligibility requirements and list any scholarships that might work for them. They can then organize them by deadline to ensure they apply on time.\n*   **Prepare materials:**Even if applicants must wait several months for the application window to open, they can still prepare documents. They can start with standard materials, like preparing an updated resume, letters of recommendation, and figuring out how to request transcripts, before writing essays unique to each scholarship.\n*   **Apply to as many scholarships as possible:**Organizations receive thousands of applications for each scholarship and award only a select few. Students can increase their funding chances by applying for every applicable scholarship, even those with awards between $100-500. Small scholarships add up. And applying for scholarships other applicants may ignore could increase the chance of being selected.\n*   **Organize backup funding plans:**Scholarships can cover a significant portion of tuition costs, but this is not guaranteed. Degree-seekers should organize additional funding plans in case they do not secure as much as expected with computer science scholarships.\n\n### How Do You Find Scholarships for Computer Science Programs?\n\nLook for computer science scholarships by contacting professional organizations, tech businesses, and university computer science departments. For general scholarship research, consult high school counselors and college financial aid offices.\n\nYou can also contact your chosen college or program directly, to ask how they award scholarships, and what their application process is like.\n\nAdditional sponsors may include private companies, as well as nonprofit foundations and organizations. Local groups and community organizations may also offer scholarships for computer science majors.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor maintains a free online [scholarship search tool](https://www.careeronestop.org/toolkit/training/find-scholarships.aspx). Students can also look for funding opportunities with their [state grant agency](https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/index.html). See below for more computer science scholarship resources:\n\n*   [Unigo STEM Scholarships](https://www.unigo.com/scholarships/by-major/stem-scholarships)\n*   [Scholarships360 STEM Scholarships](https://scholarships360.org/scholarships/stem-scholarships/)\n*   [Computer Science Scholarships at Scholarships.com](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-major/computer-science-scholarships/)\n\n### How Do You Qualify for Computer Science Scholarships?\n\nScholarship requirements vary by sponsor. Computer science scholarships may limit applicants based on factors like academic performance and financial need.\n\nOther common criteria include demographics, career goals, and specialization area. Expected application materials also vary. See below for common eligibility and submission requirements.\n\n**Eligibility Requirements**\n\n*   U.S. citizen or permanent resident\n*   Minimum 3.0 GPA\n*   Demonstrated financial need\n*   Full-time student pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree in computer science or a related STEM field\n\n**Submission Requirements**\n\n*   Completed application\n*   Personal essay\n*   CV or resume\n*   Official college transcripts\n*   Letters of recommendation\n\nScholarships for Computer Science Majors\n----------------------------------------\n\nOur list of computer science scholarships includes many helpful options. There are undergraduate and graduate scholarships, plus opportunities for women and other underrepresented populations in computer science.\n\n### Computer Science Scholarships for Undergrad Students\n\n### Association for Iron & Steel Technology Steel Intern Scholarship\n\nAny undergraduate candidate studying computer science, data science, engineering technology, or related fields can apply. College seniors can also apply if they plan to pursue graduate studies.

However, only 60% of families typically receive scholarships, [according to Sallie Mae's 2022 report](https://www.salliemae.com/content/dam/slm/writtencontent/Research/HowAmericaPaysforCollege2022.pdf).\n\nWhile scholarships can cover a significant part of your degree costs, the average scholarship only covers 26% of the total cost. Most learners combine scholarships with other aid options.\n\nThere are a couple options when it comes to [how to pay for a degree](https://www.computerscience.org/resources/how-to-pay-for-a-degree/). Degree-seekers can apply for work-study programs and private or federal loans. [Education tax credits](https://studentaid.gov/resources/tax-benefits) can also help reduce educational costs.\n\nGrants are another way for students to cover computer science degree expenses. Since these awards are similar to scholarships, we explore grant options below.\n\n### Grants for Computer Science Majors\n\nLike scholarships, students don't need to repay grants. Learners can qualify for grants based on financial need rather than merit.\n\nStudents can apply for [Federal Pell Grants](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell) and [Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/fseog). State governments, universities, and private and nonprofit organizations may also offer grants.\n\nComputer science students can also pursue research grants. Organizations offering research grants often require a research proposal and fund projects that match their missions. For example, Google awards grants to students exploring computer science education or the connection between machine intelligence and the arts.\n\nComputer science and engineering students can also find funding options through [The National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_list.jsp?org=CISE&ord=rcnt)'s search tool. The [IEEE Foundation](https://www.ieeefoundation.org/Grants) also invites grant applicants to submit projects for certain themes each year.\n\n[](https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-overview)\nAdditional Student Resources\n----------------------------\n\n[](https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-overview)\nFAQ About Scholarships for Computer Science Majors\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### Are there scholarships for computer science?\n\nYes.

Ada Lovelace helped put the computer on its current trajectory. Katherine Goble Johnson was a prolific part of the mathematical movement that gave the computer its name, and Rear Adm. Grace Hopper was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I.\n\nIn fact, the now-ubiquitous term \"programming\" exists because of women in computer science. But programming is also where the history of women in computer science takes a turn for the inequitable.\n\nProgramming was a term originally (circa 1940) given to the humdrum task of manually operating punch cards for machines like the ENIAC. In the past, this routine, nonintellectual work of programming the computer was often assigned to women employees, while the more cerebral work of deciding what the machine should do went to men.\n\nThe often inaccessible cost of higher education currently makes it easy for the trails these women blazed to become overgrown. Women people have traditionally not been encouraged to pursue STEM careers. Scholarships for women in computer science can help encourage them to enter the field and keep charging ahead.\n\n[](https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-women)\nCommon Requirements for Computer Science Scholarships\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nQualifications for scholarships vary by award. One fund may award scholarships only to undergraduates, while another may accept applications from all qualifying college students.\n\nSadly, most women-specific scholarships often exclude nonbinary people in computer science. If you're nonbinary, stop reading now and check out our [LGBTQ+ computer science scholarships](https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-lgbtq/#:~:text=Point%20Foundation%20Scholarships,to%20support%20the%20LGBTQ%2B%20community.).\n\nTo qualify for the awards, applicants must meet common requirements that include:\n\n*   Identify as female. None of the scholarships listed here insist you furnish biological proof.\n*   Major in computer science or a related field\n*   Minimum GPA requirements, such as a 3.0\n*   Meet financial need requirements\n*   Submit a personal essay, transcripts, and FAFSA form\n*   Make a commitment to specific area in computer science, such as cybersecurity\n*   Reside in certain states\n*   Leadership or volunteer experience\n\n[](https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-women)\nTop Computer Science Scholarships Awarded to Women\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFor women in computer science, scholarships can make a degree in the field accessible. However, computer science students of any gender face a support deficit when it comes to national funding.\n\nThere are fewer computer science scholarships than scholarships for other majors, especially compared to how many students are in the major. Data from 2021 shows 18.4% of federal grant money goes to health majors, while computer information science majors get 4.6% of the federal grant pie.\n\nScholarships are an excellent source of [financial aid for computer science majors](https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-overview/), as recipients do not need to repay the funds. These funding programs help promising students seeking assistance to [pay for their degrees](https://www.computerscience.org/resources/how-to-pay-for-a-degree/).\n\nThe scholarships listed below offer financial aid specifically to women in computer science programs.

Standing out requires hitting these benchmarks:\n\n1.   Follow the application instructions. Selection committees use failures to follow the instructions as a way to narrow down the applicant pool. Obeying word count limits and deadlines can help keep you in the applicant pool.\n2.   Use your essay to elaborate on your Student Aid Index (SAI) listed on your FAFSA. For instance, mention if your SAI has changed because of a medical emergency, illness, or loss of employment.\n3.   Address the selection criteria. How do you meet them? Why does that matter?\n4.   Tell a story. Use your scholarship essay to explain obstacles and victories in your life, particularly if you can relate it back to being a woman. Well-written stories can help make you memorable, but make sure you align with the essay prompt. Here are [some examples](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/scholarship-essay-examples) from the [College Essay Guy](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/).\n5.

You want the evaluators to have positive identifiers for you.\n\n[](https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-women)\nMore Resources for Women in Computer Science\n--------------------------------------------\n\nScholarship funding is just one of many resources available to women in computer science programs. Other options include finding community-based support groups that promote gender diversity and inclusion or choosing the right college with adequate equity. The following links offer additional information.\n\n[](https://www.computerscience.org/scholarships-women)\nFAQ About Women's Computer Science Scholarships\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n### Why should women studying computer science try to get a scholarship?\n\nThe tech industry has historically been a [male-dominated sector](https://www.cio.com/article/201905/women-in-tech-statistics-the-hard-truths-of-an-uphill-battle.html). Scholarships provide valuable funding for women and other underrepresented groups who wish to study in a field that hasn't been inclusive to them. Greater diversity in the tech industry improves its products and services, along with providing women access to in-demand jobs.\n\n### What kinds of scholarships are available for women in computer science?\n\nFor women in computer science, scholarships come in a wide array. These scholarships go to qualified candidates based on their academic background, financial need, major (like video game design or cybersecurity), and/or career goals. Nonprofits, colleges, and professional organizations offer scholarships to help women pay for college.\n\n### When should I start applying for computer science scholarships?\n\nEach scholarship provider sets specific application deadlines. To ensure you do not miss any opportunities, begin your search a full calendar year in advance.\n\n### How can I increase my chances of getting a scholarship?\n\nCandidates should look for opportunities to stand out in competitive fields. Women who tell a compelling personal story — or who participate in community service, leadership, extracurricular activities, and volunteering — advance their application by adding these complements to high grades.\n\n*   Hanson, Melanie.

Yet, women[only earn 18%](https://ngcproject.org/statistics)of computer science bachelor's degrees in the United States. Despite the high job demand, computer science remains a male-dominated field in the United States. In response, many top colleges are making efforts to recruit female computer science students, making it an ideal time for women to pursue computer science degrees.\n\nThe computer science field has been trying to appeal more to female employees by moving toward longer maternity leave and better work-life balance for working moms. However, efforts to attract women to tech-related careers need to begin in elementary school. On this page, you can learn more about why women aren't choosing tech careers and what can be done to change that.\n\n### Why Aren’t More Women Involved in Computer Science?\n\nStarting when computer technology first emerged during World War II and continuing into the 1960s, women made up[most of the computing workforce](https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/aug/10/how-the-tech-industry-wrote-women-out-of-history). By 1970, however, women only accounted for 13.6% of bachelor's in computer science graduates. In 1984 that number rose to 37%, but it has since declined to 18% -- around the same time personal computers started showing up in homes.[According to NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding), personal computers were marketed almost exclusively to men and families were more likely to buy computers for boys than girls.\n\nComputers are now commonplace, especially in classrooms. While it's hard to pinpoint a single reason for the lack of female computer science majors, researchers are finding that[introductory computer science courses](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/cracking-the-code:-why-aren-t-more-women-majoring-in-computer-science)play a big role in discouraging women from majoring in computer science. Luckily, organizations like[Building, Recruiting, and Inclusion for Diversity](https://braidresearch.gseis.ucla.edu/)(BRAID) are researching ways to attract and support female CS students. Currently, 15 colleges partner with BRAID to create gender-inclusive learning environments.\n\nThe percentage of women working in computer science-related professions has[declined since the 1990s](http://fortune.com/2015/03/26/report-the-number-of-women-entering-computing-took-a-nosedive/), dropping from 35% to 26% between 1990 and 2013. According to the[American Association of University Women](https://ww3.aauw.org/2015/03/26/add-women-engineering-and-tech/), we can reverse this trend by removing negative connotations around women in computer science. Educators and parents must work together to help girls maintain their confidence and curiosity in STEM subjects. Professional women already in the field can become mentors, while men can help create a more inclusive workplace.\n\nTop Online Programs\n-------------------\n\nExplore programs of your interests with the high-quality standards and flexibility you need to take your career to the next level.\n\n### Why Should Women Want to Work in Computer Science?\n\nDue to the marketing strategies of the last three decades, many women have developed misconceptions about computer science. While the notion of the geek coder is alive and well, many young women are unaware of the myriad jobs and opportunities available in tech.\n\nThe University of California at Berkeley experienced a revolution in their introductory computer science classes after changing how they marketed the course. What used to be known as introduction to symbolic programming is now called[the beauty and the joy of computing](https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Tech-shift-More-women-in-computer-science-classes-5243026.php). As a result, in 2014 women outnumbered men in the class for the very first time.\n\nAccording to the[American Association of University Women](https://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/), computer science has one of the smallest pay gaps between male and female professionals, with women earning 94% of what men earn.\n\nDiscrepancies in overall male-to-female pay rates have remained stalled for the last decade, and women are greatly underrepresented in computer science fields. Only 20% of computer science professionals are women.\n\nIncreasing the inclusion of women is a sound business strategy. A[study by Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/deloitte-review/issue-8/diversity-as-an-engine-of-innovation.html)found that women's choices account for up to 85% of buying decisions nationwide, and that diversity drives innovation. Though it is still commonplace to find boards and project teams without a female member, the integration of female perspectives will naturally lead to higher revenues and a better understanding of consumer marketplaces.\n\n### What are Some Other Reasons for Women to Consider Entering the Tech Field?\n\nIn addition to the reasons mentioned above, many tech and computer science companies are at the forefront of progressive workplace policies. Some of the most innovative tech company benefits are included below.\n\n#### Work/Life Balance\n\nIn a report by the[New York City Economic Development Corporation](https://www.nycedc.com/blog-entry/women-tech-and-work-life-balance-nyc), researchers found that women working in tech companies -- particularly start-ups -- are much more likely to have a healthy work-life balance. Many tech companies support non-traditional work procedures, including videoconferencing and [working from home](https://www.computerscience.org/resources/productivity-apps/). Furthermore, many of these companies offer flexible hours, allowing employees to work around their personal schedules to complete projects.\n\n#### Maternity Leave and Childcare\n\nWhile the average length of maternity leave in America for salaried employees is six weeks, many technology companies provide substantial paid-leave policies for new parents. Some of the best examples of parental leave policies as included below.\n\nFacebook continually strives toward creating a better work environment for its employees. Facebook allows employees [six weeks of paid leave](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/07/facebook-parental-leave-bereavement-benefits/) to care for sick children and family members, which benefits women because they are often the ones who take on this role. Facebook also offers four months of paid maternity leave.Apple also offers[excellent maternity benefits](http://fortune.com/2014/10/02/apple-employee-perks/), including 18 weeks of paid maternity leave and nine weeks of unpaid maternity leave. This is higher than the industry average, which is 11 weeks of paid maternity leave and nine weeks of unpaid maternity leave.It is no secret that Google is a trendsetter in the tech community. When it comes to paid maternity leave, they set the bar high.[Google offers](https://qz.com/604723/when-google-increased-paid-maternity-leave-the-rate-at-which-new-mothers-quit-dropped-50/)mothers 22 weeks of paid maternity leave. Parents also receive a cash gift after having a child.SAS offers benefits for both birth and adoptive mothers.[SAS employees](https://www.sas.com/en_us/company-information/employee-retiree-services.html)receive 12 weeks of paid maternity leave and eight weeks of paid adoption leave. SAS believes in providing mothers with time to bond with new children. Now that historical misconceptions have been overturned, it’s time to think about how to get more women involved in computer science and foster a lifelong passion for computer science in young girls. \n\nTop Online Programs\n-------------------\n\nExplore programs of your interests with the high-quality standards and flexibility you need to take your career to the next level.\n\nGetting Started: How Do We Get Young Women Interested in CS?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the number of women studying computer science near an all-time low, it's clear that we need to take action, and early childhood education is the root of the problem. According to recent coverage from[The Journal](https://thejournal.com/articles/2010/09/08/engaging-girls-in-stem.aspx), two-thirds of elementary-aged children indicate an interest in science; however, as they enter middle school, the percentage of interested girls falls dramatically. By high school, many girls who previously took advanced scientific courses drop them.\n\n### Reasons for the Decline of Girls Studying Computer Science\n\nThe above statistics are corroborated in an[extended report](https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/win/docs/stem_fact_sheet.pdf)from Florida Gulf Coast University and The University of Colorado, which theorizes reasons for the drop in female interest. In secondary school, less emphasis is placed on developing computer science skills in girls compared to boys. As a result, women who study STEM-related topics in college often lag behind male counterparts. Furthermore, female students lack role models, as most leaders in the field are men. Historically, scientific fields have catered to men.\n\nWhile the geek-programmer stereotype has become less popular, there is still a belief that STEM-related professions are narrow, impersonal, and unsuited for those who wish to work on a human level. In reality, computer science careers touch every part of modern human life, and many computer science positions require interpersonal skills.\n\n### Ways to Increase Girls’ Interest in Computer Science\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, the number of women studying computer science and similar fields fell into decline. In recent years, this number has leveled off between 14% and 18%, establishing a baseline against which to measure new educational initiatives. Some of the ways educators and parents can work to increase girls' interest in computer science and STEM-related subjects are addressed below.\n\n#### 1. Create an Equal Learning Environment\n\nWhile boys tend to be more verbal in class, it's up to educators to engage female students and bring them into class discussions. This will increase girls' interest in the subject matter and better prepare them for college-level courses in computer science.\n\n#### 2. Enact Mentorship Programs\n\nGirls entering the field of computer science are likely to face more resistance than in subject areas more heavily populated by females. Adults can bolster their resolve by providing examples of strong, successful females thriving in their careers. Whether by creating a mentorship program at the secondary or postsecondary level, bringing in speakers, or using female leaders as case studies, educators and parents can instill confidence in girls who pursue careers in historically male-dominated fields.\n\n#### 3. Redefine the Field\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, the number of women in computer science and related [degrees](https://www.computerscience.org/degrees-overview/) dropped sharply in the 1980s in response to male-focused marketing for home computers. In the interim years, women have shifted to subjects typically classified under humanities or liberal arts,[as explained by Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education.html).\n\nA[June 2015 Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/how-can-we-encourage-more-women-study-computer-science-341652)report featured Harvey Mudd College's efforts to counter this trend. Rather than pure programming, its introductory [computer science course](https://www.computerscience.org/resources/online-courses/) has been reworked to focus on creative problem solving and opportunities within the field. The school also made classes less intimidating by splitting the course into two sections based on incoming students' prior programming experience. Within four years, the computer science program's female student rates rose from 10% to 40%, where they plateaued.\n\nHarvey Mudd is one of several [top computer science colleges for women](https://www.computerscience.org/degrees/best-computer-science-colleges-for-women/), focused on improving gender balance in the major.\n\n#### 4. Make It Approachable\n\nAs the push to encourage more girls' to work in computer science gains momentum, a number of programs have been created to help foster interest. Some of the most innovative include:\n\n*   [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/)\n*   [SciGirls](http://pbskids.org/scigirls/home)\n*   [GEMS](https://gems.education.purdue.edu/)\n*   [Girls, Inc.](https://girlsinc.org/)\n*   [Girlstart](https://girlstart.org/)\n\nWhether operating at the middle school, high school, or collegiate level, these groups can be pivotal in encouraging and sustaining girls' pursuit of computer science careers.\n\n Outside of the organizations mentioned above, there are a number of other initiatives to engage girls in computer science. Whether it's a competition, summer camp, science fair, massive open online course (MOOC), or government program, the resources below help parents and educators think outside the box when encouraging girls in scientific pursuits. \n### Competitions and Summer Camps Focused on Computer Science\n\n#### [ProjectCSGirls](https://www.projectcsgirls.com/)\n\nThis organization hosts a computer science and technology competition in which middle school girls develop a project to solve a social problem, and includes a project mentor.\n\n#### [Technovation](https://technovationchallenge.org/)\n\nThis global technology program emphasizes entrepreneurship. Girls in middle school, high school, or college can compete to create and launch a mobile app during a three-month curriculum. Students are matched with female mentors and get to present their apps to investors via YouTube. Finalists pitch their ideas in Silicon Valley.\n\n#### [Tech Trek](https://www.aauw.org/resources/programs/tech-trek/)\n\nThis experiential summer camp created by the American Association of University Women is for middle school girls. The program seeks to make STEM topics both interesting and accessible during the developmental period, where research shows that girls' interest in these subjects tends to drop the most.\n\n#### [Carnegie Science Center](http://www.carnegiesciencecenter.org/stemcenter/stemcenter-programs/)\n\nThe Chevron Center for STEM Education and Career Development hosts a number of programs aimed at encouraging girls to pursue STEM topics, including:\n\n*   **Tour Your Future:** A career exploration program for girls aged 11-17 that seeks to show girls the many diverse STEM careers available.\n*   **CanTEEN:** A resource encouraging girls to consider STEM careers via gaming and online activities.\n*   **Click! Spy School:** Developed for girls aged 10-14 to engage them in solving mysteries and completing missions with key STEM concepts.\n\n#### [GirlStart Summer Camp](https://girlstart.org/our-programs/summer-camp/)\n\nThis weeklong summer camp is designed to help girls see that STEM subjects can be fun and meaningful, starting at a young age.\n\n### Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in Computer Science\n\nAccording to a 2013 article from[Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/wendy-drexler/how-moocs-can-bridge-the-_b_2917812.html), one of the primary challenges facing STEM is engaging students. Since careers in these industries are not well publicized, students have preconceived notions about the type of work available to computer science graduates. A great way to learn about computer science career options is through MOOCs, which are free, abbreviated online courses that provide introductory curriculum materials to students across the world.\n\nHigh schools often take advantage of these courses, especially in areas where there are few teachers available. Teachers hope that familiarizing high school students with computer science will encourage them to pursue it in postsecondary programs and careers.\n\nSome of the most interesting computer science MOOCs available include:\n\n*   [Design of Computer Programs – Stanford University](https://www.class-central.com/course/udacity-design-of-computer-programs-323)\n*   [Intro to Computer Science – University of Virginia](https://www.class-central.com/course/udacity-intro-to-computer-science-320)\n*   [Introduction to Nanoelectronics - MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-701-introduction-to-nanoelectronics-spring-2010/)\n*   [Human-Computer Interaction – Stanford University](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/CoursePage.php?course=HCI)\n*   [Introduction to Algorithms - Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-algorithms--cs215?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api)\n*   [Intro to Java Programming – San Jose State University](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282)\n\n### Government Programs Focused on CS\n\nThe U.S. government has enacted initiatives at local, state, and federal levels to engage girls and young women in STEM-related topics, including computer science. Many states have also created initiatives to engage local middle and high school girls. Some of these innovative programs are listed below.\n\nOrganized by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, this international summer exchange program brings girls from the Middle East and North Africa to America, encouraging them to pursue careers in science and technology.This statewide initiative aims to encourage girls' interest in STEM topics. The website features an online library, contests, and resources for students, parents, educators, and industry professionals.More than 66% of all astronauts have been involved in scouting, including 27 girl scouts. The administration maintains strong ties with the scouting community and offers varied initiatives to encourage scouts to pursue STEM careers.\n### Mentoring Programs for Girls in Computer Science\n\nIn a 2014[report by STEMConnector](https://www.millionwomenmentors.org/download/file/fid/866), researchers found that 20% of high school girls considering a STEM degree want to learn more about mentorship opportunities and motivational programs, while nearly 40% of women pursuing a scientific degree have a mentor. A[2010 report](https://ww3.aauw.org/research/why-so-few/)from the American Association of University women verified those numbers, noting that mentorship is an important tool for instilling confidence in girls pursuing STEM-related fields.\n\nBelow is a review of American colleges with the highest percentages of women computer science graduates and takes a deeper look at how their programs attract and retain female students.

Resources\n==========================\n\n*   Category: Additional Resources\n\nSWE Programs: K-12 and Higher Education\n---------------------------------------\n\n[SWENext](https://swe.org/k-12-outreach/swenext/swenext-clubs/)To expand the SWE community, through SWE Programs, we’ve developed a way for girls (ages 17 and under) to learn and participate in engineering: [SWENext](https://swe.org/k-12-outreach/swenext/swenext-clubs/). This unique program provides young girls, parents, and educators with the tools they need to increase their understanding of the engineering field. SWENext is a great new way to establish engagement with engineering and provides a dynamic opportunity to learn, connect with peers, and witness women engineers in action. [SWENext](https://swe.org/k-12-outreach/swenext/swenext-clubs/) participants can meet women role models, which is a critical step so that they can visualize themselves in a STEM career. To learn more about SWENext and other SWE programs, sign a future engineer up[here](https://swe.org/k-12-outreach/swenext/swenext-clubs/).\n\n[Scholarships](https://scholarships.swe.org/)\n\n In 2017, SWE awarded approximately 233 new and renewed scholarships valued at over $715,000. The SWE Scholarship Program provides financial assistance to women admitted to accredited baccalaureate or graduate programs, in preparation for careers in engineering, engineering technology, and computer science. We’ve updated our scholarship videos online to help make the application process easy. They are some of our most popular videos on YouTube. Learn more at scholarships.swe.org.\n\n[Collegiate Leadership Institute](https://alltogether.swe.org/2016/07/looking-swe-mentor-heres-opportunity/)\n\n SWE’s Collegiate Leadership Institute (CLI) is a three-day program with highly interactive sessions. It provides advanced training on how to professionally engage in the workforce, tips on work/life balance as well as best practices for interviewing and job hunting. Speakers and facilitators are noted experts in leadership and career development.\n\n* * *\n\nSWE Programs: Workplace\n-----------------------\n\n[Advance Learning Center](https://advancelearning.swe.org/)\n\n More than 100 learning opportunities are available in the Advance Learning Center, most of them free to SWE Members. SWE Learning empowers women to succeed at every stage of their personal development and professional careers. We support the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women in engineering through career resources, professional development, and one-to-one networking opportunities. In the Advance Learning Center, register for webinars or view recorded ones. You’ll also find online conferences, podcasts, and e-learning modules as well as content from five career coaches. Find it all at [advancelearning.swe.org](https://advancelearning.swe.org/).\n\n[Diversity & Inclusion Knowledge Cards](https://swe.org/learning/diproducts/)SWE’s Diversity & Inclusion knowledge cards have been developed through a collaboration between the Society of Women Engineers and Arup. Each card revolves around a key aspect of identifying the unconscious biases in the engineering industry in North America. The intention of these cards is to act as a catalyst for discussion and reflection on how companies can help foster a welcoming work environment. [Learn more here](https://swe.org/learning/diproducts/).\n\n[STEM Re-entry Task Force](https://reentry.swe.org/)\n\n The STEM Re-entry Task Force is an initiative to increase the number of technical women in the STEM sector by providing support to women who are returning from a career break. It is designed to produce a structural change in the STEM sector with internships at major engineering and technology firms as a vehicle for engaging women returning to the technical space. The STEM Re-entry Task force was formed by a partnership between SWE and iRelaunch, the leading and most comprehensive career reentry resource. Learn more at [reentry.swe.org.](https://reentry.swe.org/)\n\n[Women of Color in Engineering Collaborative](https://www.womenofcolorengineers.org/)\n\n The Society of Women Engineers, in collaboration with the Advancing Indigenous People in STEM (AISES), the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and the Women in Engineering ProActive Network (WEPAN), received a grant from the National Science Foundation ([NSF Award #2310386](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2310386)) to support the creation of the Women of Color in Engineering Collaborative (WCEC). The WCEC seeks to identify impactful promising practices for retaining women of color in the engineering profession.

Reich’s work combines fluid mechanics, numerical analysis, and computer science to increase the speed to develop these intricate aerospace products with top quality for Hon-eywell, while greatly reducing the high costs associated with laboratory testing. Reich is a principal engineer in the Installation Aerodynamics & Acoustics group at Honeywell Aerospace. Reich is currently the aerodynamics analysis lead for the M1 Abrams tank engine’s recuperator durability improvement project. Her work on the recuperator has been highly recognized within Honeywell and by the Army. Reich developed a unique method for simulating the fluid flow and heat transfer through the recuperator while significantly reducing design time. She analyzed more than 20 designs in a matter of months and was a key member in the team’s success in developing a con-ceptual design that will significantly improve the life of the engine, increase engine power and range, and save the Army a significant amount over the next 20 years. For her work on the tank engine recuperator project, she received high praise within Honeywell by receiving the 2015 Chief Engineer’s Award, which recognizes outstanding performance within Honeywell Aerospace. She is an inventor on multiple patents related to aircraft cabin pressurization valves and aircraft engine particle separators. In 2014, Reich was also a co-author for an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Turbo Expo technical paper covering the transient aerodynamics surrounding an aircraft engine inlet door. Reich’s technical leadership successes have not only been recognized within the company, but out-side as well. In 2014, she was named Young Engineer of the Year by the Phoenix Engineers Week organization. A member of SWE for 19 years, Reich joined as a first-year college student and has held various officer and chair positions. In her role as SWE Phoenix com-munications chair and newsletter editor for 12 years, Reich served as a link between the section’s officers and members, revitalized the section’s communication modes, and was a driving force in keeping the section running smoothly for many years. The section com-mended her efforts by presenting Reich with the SWE Phoenix Distinguished Service Award in 2008. Devoted to recruiting and connecting women engineers, Reich is a founding leader of the Women in Honeywell Engineering Network (WHEN), which brings networking and professional development op-portunities to women engineers within the company. Reich, a leader for Honeywell’s SWE conference involvement since 2002, organizes the participation experience for the more than 90 employees who attend and influences the recruiting process, which went from hiring just two engineers in 2009 to 57 in 2016. Reich earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering, with an emphasis in fluid mechanics, from Arizona State University. Married to a fellow engineer, Reich and her husband enjoy raising their two spunky children, also known as their future engineers. Her hobbies include dog agility with her spirited border collie and traveling with her family. \n\n## EMERGING LEADER \n\n# Jennifer Reich \n\nHONEYWELL AEROSPACE \n\nFor extensive contributions in aerodynamic analysis; for exemplary leadership; and for encouraging the next generation of women to excel in engineering. SPECIAL SECTION | AWARDS \n\n> 151 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# When growing up in Bangladesh, Moushumi Shome took great interest in her father’s work as a civil engineer. Traveling with her parents throughout the country and abroad, she observed her father’s de-sign engineering activities and decided early on that she too wanted to pursue an engineering career. Shome is the senior technical lead engineer on the 737 airframe at The Boeing Company in Renton, Washington, where she reviews 737 MAX and 737 Next Generation interior stress part drawings; applies classi-cal and finite element method analyses to 737 airframe supplier analysis; and finalizes airframe strength-check notes in collaboration with airworthiness representa-tives, Boeing associate technical fellows, and subject matter experts. She developed microwave curing for composite repair, a manufacturing breakthrough that reduces the composite curing rate by 50 percent. As part of this focus, in 2009 Shome led Structures Tech Talk — a monthly webcast for Boeing engineers to learn about the challenging and innovative work the Boeing structures community performs. In addition, Shome served as principal investigator of product development’s optimized variable camber, us-ing smart materials concepts in the Edges Architecture project. The project aimed to reduce drag by varying the airfoil camber and thus to reduce aircraft fuel consumption. Carrying out her assignment, Shome invented the trailing edge variable camber concept and matured this to technology readiness level 6. Her work created a new industry standard for defining the maturity level of a demonstrated prototype or concept and resulted in an impressive weight reduction of more than 100 pounds. Because of her ability to execute complex shape memory alloy (SMA) technology analyses, Shome has become the prime expert on SMA — a prominent can-didate in morphing technology that reduces weight and enables fuel efficiency — and its application at Boeing. Shome has invented numerous SMA-related concepts that represent large milestones in this technology’s development, including her invention of induction heating for SMA achieved rapid-rate actuation, meeting the aircraft flap moving rate. She is a highly sought-after coach in the Boeing JumpStart Mentoring program.

AWARDS | SPECIAL SECTION  \n\n> 152 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Shannon Vittur established herself as a leader dedi-cated to making a difference during her studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering with high-est honors, and a master’s in mechanical engineering. This led to her first eight years of work developing products for Medtronic Spine and DePuy Orthopaedics. Her accomplishments in product development ranged from obtaining U.S. patents, to product launches to manufacturing and process improvements. Her assign-ments at Medtronic typically involved products with new technologies that had no clear path to market. Projects with complex regulatory pathways require an engineer to be knowledgeable about design, biome-chanics, and spinal movement, and Vittur excelled in these areas. She had direct engineering responsibility for several product launches and clinical studies, including two products designed to enhance hip replacement patients’ stability in revision hip surgeries, a large diameter acetabular shell with enhanced screw fixation options to revise a hip replacement, and an interspinous process device to address degenerative disc disease in the spine. Her work also extends to technical achievements that created differentiation in the spine and orthopaedic markets. Her product development accomplishments have resulted in three issued U.S. patents, and key technologies supporting the design and manufacturing of the products she launched. While at DePuy Orthopaedics, Vittur focused on products that addressed stability and bone loss in revision hip surgeries. Her design and development work introduced a new modular trial system that streamlined an instrument set to 11 components from the original 55. Vittur spent 2007–2010 as the lead engineer on an interspinous process device, a novel alternative to spinal fusion. She became a trusted technical expert on the device’s biomechanics, surgical technique, and clinical study and was often called to assist with intraoperative surgery support and surgeon training. Her work led Vittur to serve as both an engineer and a project manager. Most recently, she has worked in a role in her business’s Research and Development group, focusing on leading “Voice of Customer” for the organization. She also is a core team lead for a com-mercialization program focused on a novel pediatric scoliosis treatment. This team is leading the way in treating adolescent deformity by developing disrup-tive technology that may result in fewer surgeries for patients. In addition, Vittur is involved with Medtronic’s Women in Science and Engineering Initiative, which is focused on leveraging gender diversity to drive innova-tion. She leads the development team for the initiative and supports programs at her business. A member of SWE, Vittur played an active role in setting up the recently chartered Memphis Section, where she is the current vice president. She served as professional development chair and was a key driver on the charter team that built the momentum to allow the new section to receive its charter in 2016. Vittur stays active in promoting STEM education, serving as a mentor to aspiring and professional engi-neers, working to increase the number of women going into engineering and coaching girls in various robotic competitions. She enjoys traveling with her significant other, photography, and supporting Georgia Tech sports.

SPECIAL SECTION | AWARDS \n\n> 153 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Justyna Zander, Ph.D., is an elite expert in the field of computer science and engineering, having authored more than 60 peer-reviewed publications; 16 patent applications; three internationally recognized scientific books; and some 100 invited talks, plenary talks, panel discussions, conference presentations, and other engi-neering community contributions. Her most recent accomplishments are an intricate part of her position as the senior automotive product manager at NVIDIA Corporation, where she focuses on self-driving cars, autonomous transportation, and functional safety for artificial intelligence. Dr. Zander’s research and development involves designing system and platforms architecture for self-driving cars and advanced driving assistance systems. She works on systems on chip and the corresponding firmware for modern cars. Prior to joining NVIDIA, Dr. Zander led projects at Intel Corporation, as well as five consulting projects on software and system functional safety for OEMs (manu-facturer resellers) and suppliers such as BMW, Volvo, Audi, Jaguar Land Rover (UK), Daimler, Ford, Delphi, Bosch, Continental, FEV, Zollner, and Magneti Marelli. One of her chief contributions was developing the first signal feature-oriented paradigm that enabled the abstract description of discrete and continuous signals and their properties. The result allowed for early detec-tion and mitigation of failures for system behavior in self-driving cars and contributes to safe, self-organizing mobility services. Earlier in her career, Dr. Zander led a team of nine organizations that built the Smart Emergency Response System within SmartAmerica Challenge, a White House initiative in 2013-14. SmartAmerica participants work to build cyberphysical systems as a glimpse of the future to save lives, create jobs, foster businesses, and improve the economy. Dr. Zander also was one of the first to synthesize the material to highlight how computational progress helps society develop and extend advanced human skills, apply computational results, and use them to improve people’s quality of life. Another of Dr. Zander’s breakthroughs involved extending the notion of computational time while performing a simulation interpretation. That allowed better and less-error-prone design methods for the sys-tems of tomorrow so that self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities applications can be designed as correct by construction and any failure modes miti-gated from the start. Though Dr. Zander is an invited member of approxi-mately 50 technical program and review committees for prestigious journals, she finds time to mentor younger women, supervise students’ theses, and speak at lecture series at local universities. Dr. Zander holds a B.S. in computer science and a B.S. in environmental protection from the Gdansk University of Technology, Poland.

AWARDS | SPECIAL SECTION  \n\n> 154 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Kira Zdunek, a strategic supply chain and strategy manager at Caterpillar Inc., started her career as one of the company’s top recruits in the Leadership and Technical Development Program. There, she demonstrated outstanding capabilities in her earliest assignments. For example, she led a study of a new process called hard chrome plating for hydraulic cylinders and struts. Her study led to the implementa-tion for the first time in high-volume manufacturing of high-velocity oxygen fuel, which did away with the nonenvironmentally friendly hard chrome plating process. Zdunek also supervised the hydraulic excava-tor operations, where she optimized factory resources, re-engineered the line-scheduling process, and oversaw a production volume jump on excavators of 40 percent. A separate stint as a large wheel loader (LWL) stra-tegic logistics planner led Zdunek to engineer a new design and process for the LWL storage area, which improved record accuracy by 40 percent and created a visual management standard that became the facility’s benchmark. She gained a promotion to the material require-ments supervisor’s role in the Global Hydraulics and Hydraulics Systems division, where she led a team that managed 320 suppliers and more than $80 million in inventory. She implemented a “plan for every part” process that improved record accuracy, reduced lead times, and drove an inventory reduction. Zdunek also improved material availability to the assembly line from 87 percent to 95 percent by working with critical suppliers, identifying root cause analysis, and driving action plans. While continuing to develop innovative solutions, Zdunek began attending evening classes, earning her MBA from Northern Illinois University in the spring of 2008. During that time, she earned a Six Sigma black belt position at Caterpillar’s Global Hydraulics and Hydraulics Systems division. She used her newfound knowledge to implement process improvements for inventory management, and then led a team of supplier performance engineers as the supply chain process and performance manager. After earning promotions to supply chain management head and a divisional leadership role in the Advanced Components and Systems division, Zdunek now is the strategic supply chain and strategy manager for the Surface Mining and Technology division. She leads an international team responsible for developing and implementing end-to-end supply chain strategy for six major product lines. Outside of work, Zdunek has been a community leader.

SPECIAL SECTION | AWARDS \n\n> 163 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Erika D. Rodriguez, Ph.D., is a materials research and test engineering team lead for Jacobs Technology at NASA Ames Research Center’s (ARC) thermophysics arc jet facility, which simulates planetary entry environments. She researches mission-critical hardware and materials for NASA’s Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and analyzes post-spaceflight materials and components. Born in a small farming community in Fresno, Cali-fornia, Dr. Rodriguez obtained her bachelor’s degree in engineering science from Smith College, the first all-women college in the country to have an engineering bachelor’s degree program. In her sophomore year, Dr. Rodriguez led a team of five classmates to custom de-sign an apparatus to test plant growth in microgravity environments, critical research for human habitation in space. Her team was selected for the highly competitive NASA Reduced Gravity Student Flight Opportuni-ties Program and flew on the KC-135 aircraft, which simulates microgravity environments, to test their apparatus. The experience introduced Dr. Rodriguez to engineering design — a process that proved to be the keystone of her academic and professional career. Dr. Rodriguez received her M.S. and Ph.D. in aero-space and mechanical engineering, with a specialty in materials science, from Syracuse University. Her graduate research focused on developing polymeric ma-terials exhibiting a “shape memory assisted self-healing (SMASH)” response. In 2012, she joined ERC Inc. at NASA ARC as a post-doc and was promoted to a full-time research scientist two years later. She was instrumental in designing and executing material extraction from the Orion heat shield for postflight analysis — the first time in NASA’s history that such a large material extraction and analysis was performed on a flown heat shield. The only Hispanic female engineer to take on such a critical oper-ation, Dr. Rodriguez attended the Orion EFT-1 launch at Kennedy Space Center to witness the successful launch of the capsule’s heat shield. A week later she traveled to San Diego to witness the crew vehicle recovery. In 2002, Dr. Rodriguez received a SWE/Bechtel scholarship from the SWE Golden Gate Section. This award set the course for her service to SWE. She joined the collegiate section at Smith, served as treasurer, and organized Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. She was scholarship chair of the Hartford Section and set up its high school scholarship program. When she joined the Santa Clara Valley Section, Dr. Rodriguez again served as scholarship chair, this time pushing for and establishing need-based scholarships. In the past five years, Dr. Rodriguez has helped award $45,000 in schol-arships. She is currently the vice president of career guidance for the Santa Clara Valley Section, responsible for professional development and scholarship programs. Her humanitarian work includes volunteering at the Second Harvest Food Bank in San Jose, California; or-ganizing the building of an accessible playhouse for an 8-year-old Hispanic girl with spina bifida; and raising $2,500 for Habitat for Humanity. Dr. Rodriguez always finds time to mentor students and encourage them to pursue engineering. She created and spearheaded a new NASA ARC summer research program aimed at the Seven Sister Colleges to increase the number of female scientists and engineers at NASA.

AWARDS | SPECIAL SECTION  \n\n> 168 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Susan Thomas Schlett, senior SWE life member, has spent the past 35 years making an impact on the local, regional, and Society levels of SWE. With her dedication to membership, she has vastly strengthened four professional sections in three regions, sharing what she learned from those efforts in her role as Society-level membership committee chair. Schlett’s ongoing emphasis on building personal connections is part of her determination to realize her dream of seeing the population of women engineers increase as well as SWE’s membership double in her lifetime. After moving to eastern Wisconsin in 2004, Schlett served two terms as Wisconsin Section president and several terms as membership chair. Each year, she phones hundreds of members, getting to know them and sharing SWE membership opportunities and ben-efits. Her personal outreach made people feel included and helped nearly triple the section’s size to more than 250 members, earning her the Region H Distinguished Service Award. Wherever Schlett has gone, the SWE organization and framework has expanded and flourished. While an undergraduate engineering major at Trinity College, in Hartford, Connecticut, she helped SWE members prepare and present a winning charter package for the school. She also chartered the school’s SWE section and served as its first president. Schlett was the only woman to graduate from Trinity College with an engineering degree in 1984. From 1984-1999, while working as a mechanical test engineer for Sikorsky Aircraft, a division of United Technologies Corporation (UTC) at the time, Schlett arranged for several UTC teams to attend SWE annual career fairs. As the Hartford Section representative, she co-authored Region F bylaws that enabled its first executive council. In 2006, Schlett joined the Society collegiate upgrade committee, where she helped develop a pilot program to ease collegiate members into professional member status, strengthening SWE’s membership framework. Three years later, as SWE Charlotte-Metrolina Section membership chair, she helped it grow from small to medium size, for which she received the section’s 2010 Service to SWE Award. As the Society’s membership committee chair, Schlett produced SWE’s first membership webinars, in which she shared her member recruitment and retention philosophy, experience, and techniques. That informa-tion now resides in SWE’s leadership coaching modules. Schlett encouraged committee members to work directly with professional sections to actively steward growth. She became a SWE life member in 1996. Schlett left Sikorsky and engineering in 1999 to “engineer her family,” splitting any free time between family and SWE endeavors. She lives in Wisconsin with her husband and three teenagers, one of whom plans to study engineering. A longtime officer on the local school parent booster committee, Schlett enjoys gardening and supporting her children’s activities. \n\n## DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARD \n\n# Susan Thomas Schlett \n\nSIKORSKY AIRCRAFT/TRINITY COLLEGE \n\nFor being a devoted leader and fierce advocate for SWE’s mission; for building a strong framework for membership growth and retention; and for continuous service at all organizational levels. SPECIAL SECTION | AWARDS \n\n> 169 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Janet L. Williams, F.SWE, has enjoyed a long career at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she is currently a principal member of the systems research and analysis staff. She has worked in many areas of the labs, including facilities design, construction project management, site planning, infrastructure investment planning, systems engineering support, and talent manage-ment. In addition, she had the privilege of serving a two-year assignment on loan to the Atomic Weapons Establishment in the United Kingdom, and a one-year assignment at the National Nuclear Security Adminis-tration in Washington, D.C. Williams uses the same strengths that have made her a key contributor at Sandia — high-level thinking, strategic planning, systems integration, and communi-cation skills — to bring added value to SWE as a leader on the local, regional, and Society levels. For more than 30 years, Williams has contributed to the Society in many areas. She co-founded two sections, the University of Missouri-Kansas City Collegiate Section in 1985, and the Central New Mexico Section in 1988. She has served as local section president and section representative; co-chair of the 1997 national convention; and as member and chair of the editorial board, strategic planning committee, the government relations and public policy committee, and the now sun-set strategic communications committee. Williams also served as a member of the national convention, conven-tion planning, and awards and recognition committees. She has consistently pursued recognition for other women engineers, successfully nominating nine women for recognition in seven SWE award categories. She has helped the Central New Mexico Section fund four higher-education scholarships for women engi-neers, has participated in local STEM outreach efforts, and has actively advised and mentored several male and female engineers whom she recruited to Sandia. She loves writing and has contributed many articles to SWE Magazine over the years. SWE has recognized Williams’ efforts by awarding her the Distinguished New Engineer Award in 1994 and naming her a Fellow of the Society in 2009.

AWARDS | SPECIAL SECTION  \n\n> 170 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Diane L. Peters, Ph.D., P.E., F.SWE, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Kettering University in Flint, Michigan, has worked doubly hard to succeed as a SWE student section faculty advisor. She does this despite already being, in the words of her colleagues, “one of the most active and productive tenure-track faculty on campus.” Such a commitment is necessary because Kettering, a co-op learning institution, splits its students’ time equally between classroom instruction and on-the-job training. Every 90 days, half its students rotate off cam-pus. To accommodate this schedule, SWE operates two student sections (A and B), and Dr. Peters, who joined the faculty in 2013, chose to advise both. Dr. Peters offered her support and deep SWE institutional knowledge to the students and is credited with a passion to propel the young women to reach their career and personal potential. Her depth of com-mitment and knowledge of the SWE opportunity for revitalizing the sections and for enriching their leaders’ SWE, collegiate, and personal experiences has been highly effective. Dr. Peters’ degree of engagement and student acces-sibility has been exceptional. She regularly attends both sections’ meetings and events, checks in at least once per term with each section’s leaders to discuss opera-tional issues, and maintains an open-door policy. Her constant presence at section events and her genuine interest in members’ welfare has helped raise member retention rates. A SWE life member and Fellow with 24 years of consistent engagement and leadership experience at all levels, Dr. Peters understands the benefits of increased SWE involvement. Before her involvement, only A Sec-tion members attended SWE’s annual conference, and neither section attended the region conference. Now, attendance has increased across the board. Her ability to get leaders to try new things has brought section awards and individual recognition. With her help, the B Section received a SWE program development grant for a new, daylong mother/daughter STEM education outreach event, called IF WE. The program earned the Society’s 2015 Outreach Award for a small collegiate section; and, with her encourage-ment, its chief promoter, the section president applied for and received the Region H Collegiate Emerging Leader Award. She also mentored and encouraged a student member to present a paper at the Region H conference in 2017. Dr. Peters’ successful outreach to university de-partments has resulted in internal email marketing support, outside corporate sponsorships, and Kettering annual giving funds being earmarked for the sections. Before entering academia, Dr. Peters worked 16 years as a mechanical engineer, and she is a licensed profes-sional engineer in Illinois and Michigan. She earned a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Notre Dame; an M.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago; and a Ph.D., also in mechanical engineering, from the University of Michigan. In her leisure time, Dr. Peters is an advocate for ani-mal welfare, quilts, and studies Brazilian jiujitsu. \n\n## OUTSTANDING FACULTY ADVISOR \n\n# Diane L. Peters, Ph.D., P.E. \n\nFor her generous contribution of time, energy, and encouragement to two SWE sections; for her accessibility, dedication, and enthusiasm; and for her tireless advocacy on behalf of students. SPECIAL SECTION | AWARDS \n\n> 171 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Since becoming counselor to the University of Colo-rado’s SWE collegiate section (SWE-CU) in 2011, Casey Waggy has made building strong ties between SWE’s local professional section and her collegiate members a priority. Waggy is an aerospace engineer with Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation and a leader in SWE’s Rocky Mountain Section (RMS). In 2014, she helped start an annual tea party social event at Boulder’s Dushanbe Tea House. It was the area’s first recurring networking opportunity for collegiate and professional members. The following year, she helped coordinate Coffee with Collegiates, a breakfast networking event at iCON15, Region i’s an-nual conference. But the single most successful networking/bonding experience grew out of the student members’ proposal in 2014 to bid for and co-host iCON16 with SWE RMS. One week before members approached Waggy with their idea, RMS members had voted against bidding for the conference. Yet Waggy, who was then president of SWE RMS, prevailed upon them to support the col-legiate section’s bid and to agree to serve as co-hosts. Ultimately, SWE-CU’s bid to co-host the February 2016 conference was approved. The two-year, joint-planning effort that followed created an excellent opportunity for the collegians to collaborate with and learn from the professional members. Waggy’s ongoing support, engagement, and mentoring were credited for making the experience a success. The two sections continue to interact regularly, including an “Intern for a Day” pilot program in FY17 that connects professionals and collegiates and intro-duces students to local companies. Her simultaneous, enthusiastic engagement as SWE counselor, SWE RMS president and outreach volunteer, and lead thermal engineer on the JPSS-1 spacecraft at Ball made Waggy an excellent role model for the collegiate section, demonstrating the value of SWE membership in career development and the diverse op-portunities for involvement. Waggy also focused on, and strengthened, the collegiate section’s internal operations. She regularly attended monthly board meetings, and helped the section reestablish fairer, more open elections — in line with its bylaws. She encouraged the section to train its incoming officers sooner, facilitating smoother transi-tions. Waggy persuaded the section’s governing board to expand its number of operating committees, provid-ing more leadership opportunities. That improvement produced a surge in member involvement and earned SWE-CU Region i’s Highest Member Involvement Award, at iCON16. She also has encouraged members to celebrate one another’s accomplishments. In response, the section nominated several members for the SWE Future Leader (SWEFL) program, and a CU member was chosen as one of two SWEFLs from Region i in both FY16 and FY17. Waggy earned a B.S.E. in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and an M.S. in aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder. When she isn’t multitasking as a SWE and commu-nity volunteer, Waggy enjoys photography; traveling; hiking and skiing with her husband, Scott; and relaxing at home with the family cat and dog. \n\n## OUTSTANDING SWE COUNSELOR \n\n# Casey Waggy \n\nBALL AEROSPACE AND TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION \n\nFor providing the role model for a fully engaged, effective leader; for tirelessly advancing collegiate members’ personal and professional interests; and for creating a culture of mutual appreciation and respect. AWARDS | SPECIAL SECTION  \n\n> 172 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Erin Baumgartner joined SWE in 2012 when the small California State University, Chico (Chico State) Collegiate Section had just been revived after a leadership turnover had left the top posts vacant. She jumped into the void, serving as FY13-14 vice president, FY15 president, and FY16 section administrator. In the latter role, Baumgartner mentored the section president and new section officers and helped develop a strategic plan and sustainable practices. Baumgartner, who in May earned a bachelor’s in electrical engineering with minors in computer engineering and manufacturing, played key roles in enabling the section to host both long-term outreach programs and annual outreach events in the commu-nity. The section attended its first region and Society conferences as a section (since its revival) during her presidency, and has sent students to both conferences annually since. The section also expanded its professional develop-ment portfolio by conducting resume workshops, panel sessions, and leadership modules from SWE head-quarters. For its efforts, the section received awards at university, region, and Society levels. Baumgartner, who also served as the FY17 Region A collegiate senator, remained active in her SWE section in myriad ways. She spent more than two years creat-ing a project-planning guide for the section’s annual, award-winning STEM outreach event, Imagineer Day. The event requires over 60 volunteers, more than 250 volunteer hours, a budget of about $5,000, and draws more than 220 K-8 children. She mentored, sponsored, and sought recognition for SWE officers, submitting nominations and contributing letters of support for more than 25 award nominations for her colleagues the past two years. From September 2013 to July 2014, Baumgartner helped spearhead the section’s outreach program, “Small Satellites for Secondary Students (S4),” a NASA-funded program carried out in partnership with Chico Girl Scouts. And, during the 2014-15 academic year, she founded a SWENext club and mentorship program with Chico’s Inspire School of Arts and Sciences (high school). Outside of SWE activities, Baumgartner has helped with recruitment, planning, and contacting profes-sionals to host technical workshops for Chico State’s Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) student branch.

SPECIAL SECTION | AWARDS \n\n> 175 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Emily E. Hoffman earned her Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from Northwestern Uni-versity, graduating in 2017. Her doctoral thesis focused on using electron microscopy to understand the na-noscale wear and corrosion of biomedical materials. Dr. Hoffman is currently a consulting associate at Charles River Associates in the life science practice, where she works on multidisciplinary teams to guide pharmaceu-tical companies as they develop novel products. Dr. Hoffman knew she wanted to join the Society of Women Engineers after attending a SWE engineering weekend at The Ohio State University as a high school student in 2005. Throughout undergraduate and graduate school, her dedication and leadership in SWE’s outreach and mentoring efforts grew steadily. She entered Case Western Reserve University in 2007 as an undergraduate, joining the SWE collegiate sec-tion. She graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor’s degree in biomedical engineering. Starting graduate school at Northwestern University in 2011, Dr. Hoffman was the only graduate student in the SWE section. Identifying opportunities for graduate-student involvement, in 2014 she co-founded a graduate subcommittee, NU GradSWE. Serving on the NU GradSWE leadership team for two years, she helped develop a simple, yet effective mentorship program: grad/undergrad coffee dates. Dr. Hoffman also mentored first-generation college students, helping them feel confident on their paths to graduate school. Today, an established GradSWE leadership team and 20 active graduate members are thriving. Dr. Hoffman also served as a leader for Northwestern SWE’s Summer Technology and Engineering Program (STEP), a weeklong STEM camp for middle-school girls, during the summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016. She developed an interactive biomedical engineering lesson, a sustainability lesson, and a materials science demonstration. As part of the Society-level GradSWE committee, Dr. Hoffman served as the FY17 graduate program-ming coordinator, recruiting talented speakers and developing new ideas for the annual conference. Based on requests from participants at WE14 and WE15, Dr. Hoffman packaged her “Preparing Powerful Application Essays” talk so the women who saw it at the conference could share it with their local sections. In graduate school, Dr. Hoffman served as president of the Materials Science Student Association, the social and community-building organization of her department.

AWARDS | SPECIAL SECTION  \n\n> 176 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Iris Jing leveraged her initiative and creativity to give members greater input and ownership of the SWE section at The University of Texas at Austin, boosting membership by 33 percent. Jing, who served as the SWE section president before graduating in May 2017 with a bachelor’s degree in petroleum engineering, started sev-eral new, cutting-edge programs during her collegiate career with SWE. As president, Jing reconfigured the SWE section’s membership campaign to focus less on officer positions and more on what it means to be a SWE member. She initiated member-led interest groups and opened event-planning sessions to members for the first time, all of which led to a more active, devoted, and populous membership. The success earned the SWE section the Region C Outstanding Collegiate Section and Creative Membership Campaign awards. Jing’s SWE involvement began her first year at UT-Austin, when she served as publicity chair, managing social media presence and advertising for the section’s events. Rather than using templates, she created her own eye-catching advertisements, and worked on targeting specific audiences. She also distinguished herself as treasurer in 2015 by working with each officer from the start of planning events. That practice enabled Jing to map out expenses and payment methods, giving the other SWE officers greater insights into the section’s finances. She exhibited her financial smarts again when she boldly persuaded the SWE section to shut down its labor-intensive, low-profit-margin snack store and hold fundraisers instead. The switch doubled the section’s cash flow. As FY16 vice president-corporate, Jing oversaw the annual Networking Night for 150 students and 20 companies, cultivated relationships with more than 30 companies, and solicited $60,000 in income. She also revamped SWE’s professional development program, creating casual, interactive sessions where students learned from one another. To do that, Jing started ECAC Workshop Chats and the signature EXPO101 event to improve knowledge sharing among members in more intimate settings. Jing has also been an active member of the Cockrell School of Engineering Student Engineering Council; the Women in Engineering Program, where she was part of the WEP Leadership Collaborative; and the Society of Petroleum Engineers. In these leadership roles, Jing revitalized the annual engineeringwide Halloween canned food drive to be a UT campuswide event by collaborating with students in four other schools, and helped establish partnerships between the Student Engineering Council and three local middle and high schools to continue paving the path for future STEM students. For her leadership, Jing was awarded one of six Student Leadership Awards by the Cockrell School. Jing completed three oil and gas internships, where she performed hands-on fieldwork with operators and technical reservoir analysis alongside industry experts. Back in the classroom, Jing leveraged her experience to lead the reservoir simulation portions of both her senior design and reservoir class team projects. She now works as an upstream engineer at ExxonMobil. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with friends and family, traveling, and cheering on the UT Longhorns. \n\n## OUTSTANDING COLLEGIATE MEMBER \n\n# Iris Jing \n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN \n\nFor demonstrating an innovative and courageous spirit that positively transforms those around her, by empowering members and encouraging fruitful collaborations across the campus.

Kane joined SWE in 2008 when she began her electrical engineering curriculum. Though neither of her schools had a recognized SWE section, Kane maintained her SWE membership and actively pursued opportunities to bring programming for women in STEM to campus. As a result, SWE membership increased across her undergraduate institutions. As a graduate student at RPI, Kane became involved with SWE at the region level, serving as the FY16 region graduate representative for Region F, as well as the re-gion outreach committee representative. There, she was able to increase awareness of graduate student needs in the region, planning and executing several graduate student focused sections at the region conferences that have since become a standard part of the confer-ence schedule. In addition, Kane champions outreach throughout the region, making sure all sections have access to outreach resources, providing and developing toolkits to assist in starting parent/educator programs, SWENext clubs, and start-up outreach activities. She is also the advisor and sponsor of Region F’s first SWENext club, which is in its third year of operation. Kane served as the FY17 graduate member coordi-nator-elect. During FY17, she helped provide graduate programming to the inaugural WE Local conferences and assisted in developing infrastructure for the GradSWE committee to communicate with individual sections through intermediate representation. She also developed and implemented a new mentoring program for graduate students, pairing students with profession-als in industry, academia, and government. Kane also is a member of the Women in Academia committee and advocates graduate student needs and collaboration at the Society level. She served as the SUNY Albany Graduate Student Association vice president in 2012. She acted as a uni-versity leader, sitting on the faculty senate and senate councils for three years advocating transparency and student rights. She was on the University Auxiliary Ser-vices board of directors, providing direction in strategic planning for the university. In her spare time, Kane works with students through Project Lead The Way and mentors them through high school engineering capstone projects. She was born and raised in Colonie, New York, and promotes STEM in her community. \n\n## OUTSTANDING COLLEGIATE MEMBER \n\n# Genevieve A.

While an undergrad, Marshall eagerly took on leader-ship positions in the section, rising to president and implementing programs such as SWEries, a biweekly series of 30-minute stress-relief get-togethers that gave members the opportunity to network with officers and committee chairs. As president, she led efforts that in-creased the section’s membership by 20 percent, and led outreach programs for elementary and middle-school children that continue to thrive. In addition to her role as president, Marshall served the SWE section as secretary, fundraising chair, vice president of membership, and vice president of outreach. She is credited with keeping communication open between the region and collegiate SWE sections in her service as Region D’s collegiate representative. As vice president of outreach, Marshall was one of the coordinators of innovative get-togethers such as a “Ghosts of Engineering Past” theme for a “Wow! That’s Engineering!®” event, and two elementary-school programs — “Mommy, Me and SWE” and “Dads and Daughters Do Science.” She also started a middle-school engineering club that met at a local school once a week, hosted by the university’s SWE section. In her first year at UA, Marshall also joined the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), served on the 2016 Southern Regional Conference plan-ning committee, and served as a chemical engineering peer mentor to other first-year members of AIChE. She also was a mentor for UA’s Honors College program and for the College of Engineering’s Men-tor Undergraduate Peer Partnering program, where she encouraged those she mentored to attend SWE meetings and introduced them to SWE leaders. As a result, the SWE collegiate section’s past liaison and vice president of membership, and current secretary were mentored by Marshall. Marshall’s ambition was also evidenced by her being a founding member of The University of Alabama’s chapter of Delta Epsilon Iota, a prestigious honors organization. She was elected president from 2012 through 2014. In the workplace, Marshall’s technical achievements include implementing new equipment to improve the quality of adhesive products, using data to verify that prices for products are accurate, and working on recycling waste to save the plant thousands of dollars each year. Prior to her internships with Unilever and Dow Chemical, Marshall worked on absorbent polymers research at the university, where she made monomers and bulk polymers, and then tested the polymers’ absorbency and permeability.

SPECIAL SECTION | AWARDS \n\n> 179 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Catherine Martsolf, a senior environmental engineering major at Temple University and past president of the Society of Women Engineers collegiate section (Temple SWE), proves her dedication to increas-ing the percentage of women in engineering through her tireless outreach efforts. Last year as president, Martsolf led a section of 16 executive board members and 60 collegiate members. The SWE section’s general body has jumped 20 percent during Martsolf’s tenure, due partly to her ensuring that fellow students understand the resources available at the Society level and the benefits to joining SWE both as a collegian and a professional. Martsolf, who hosted a workshop at the past Region E conference and attended the last three, as well as served as an “Invent It. Build It.” Role Model at WE15 and WE16, led Temple SWE’s efforts to win its first Outstanding Collegiate Section Award at WE16. She also helped in the SWE section’s first section applica-tion and award for Media Communications, presented at the 2016 Region E conference. She initiated the pilot HeForSWE campaign, in which HeForSWE ambassadors invite students to attend meetings and act as outspoken supporters of mentors in STEM. Martsolf and the director of HeForSWE worked together to recruit the Mayor of Philadelphia, the Temple University president, and the dean of the college to act as ambassadors for the cause on campus. Through her work as president of Temple SWE, being a focus group leader for the strategic initiatives com-mittee, Martsolf strives to serve others. As a committee member, she discusses strategies to help members sup-port diversity in the workplace. She also served as the intercollegiate liaison for the WE16 “Invent It. Build It.” committee, to ensure young students in the Philadelphia area registered for the outreach event. Throughout her tenure in Temple SWE, Martsolf strengthened the relationship with the Cal Poly, Drexel University, UPenn, Villanova, and Penn State SWE sections. She also initiated the first collabo-ration with Drexel’s Graduate Women in Science and Engineering at the 2015 Philadelphia Science Carnival, which continues in the section today. As section secretary, Martsolf helped obtain 4 STARS organization status — the highest level of recognition at Temple; represented SWE in Temple student govern-ment and Student Professional Engineering Council (SPEC) meetings; and helped garner the section’s first sponsors, such as Lockheed Martin and Pennoni. In her time as secretary, Martsolf also organized the section’s first Annual Alumni Networking Dinner. In her years at Temple, she was also heavily involved on campus, leading collaborations with She’s The First, an organization that sponsors education for young girls in developing countries, and served as a student repre-sentative on the Temple Alumni Association board. Martsolf has worked as an intern in the environmen-tal engineering lab at Temple, in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Brownfields program, and for Urban Engineers Inc. She has also become a licensed as-bestos inspector in the tri-state area, and is certified in hazardous waste operations and emergency response.

AWARDS | SPECIAL SECTION  \n\n> 180 SWE CONFERENCE 2017\n\n# Holly McTaggart wasted no time in propelling her SWE collegiate section into the instant-messaging and breaking-news milieu. While serving as diversity chair and secretary, McTaggart, a senior at the Univer-sity of Louisville who is pursuing her bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering, redesigned the SWE section’s communications efforts by subscribing to a group messaging application that sends members relevant notifications on their phones. McTaggart also designed a “Welcome to SWE” bro-chure to distribute to first-year students that explained SWE’s benefits and created a weekly newsletter that kept members informed of section activities and news and worldwide issues pertinent to SWE. The newsletter was recognized with regional awards. In the 2016-17 academic year, her third year in SWE, McTaggart transitioned to section president, spear-heading a 13 percent increase in active membership through her continued commitment to constant com-munication and quality programming. One example is “Blended Diversity,” a partnered program she initiated with the American Society of Engineers of Indian Ori-gin. The initiative went beyond a smoothies-centered social event to become a learning experience about differing cultures and perspectives within engineering. McTaggart is now working to become a leadership coaching committee coach so she can bring personal and professional development seminars to the col-legiate section. She also is pursuing a region collegiate representa-tive role, in which she aims to support other collegiate sections in membership growth, programming, and leadership development. Her interest in developing others as leaders became apparent in her role as section president, as she mentored other young female students and encouraged SWE members to volunteer to better the university’s J.B. Speed School of Engineering com-munity. Indeed, McTaggart is often in the Office of Student Success, helping the staff develop an idea, volunteering for a program, or simply checking in. Because she serves as an exceptional bridge for the students to the Speed School, SWE usually has the highest representation at any event the office puts on, or in volunteer roles that need to be filled. McTaggart has served on multiple committees across student organizations, such as the diversity committee, which puts on a weeklong program of events represent-ing and celebrating differing social identities on the Louisville campus. As a member of the women’s leadership conference committee, McTaggart encouraged an enthusiastic sec-tion member to serve as the SWE representative instead of assuming the role herself. In addition to her studies, McTaggart gained profes-sional experience throughout her collegiate career. She worked full time for Amazon, advancing from the warehouse floor to a management position. She also completed three semesters as a reliability engineering co-op at Beam Suntory (parent company of Jim Beam), and plans to complete a master’s in engineering man-agement, also at the University of Louisville. She also completed an internship as a project engineering intern with the Nifco America Corp. McTaggart grew up in Southern California and is a nontraditional student. She attended three different higher education institutions before settling at the University of Louisville. During her time of study, on top of the required co-op experience, she has worked as both a bartender and a tutor. \n\n## OUTSTANDING COLLEGIATE MEMBER \n\n# Holly McTaggart \n\nUNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE \n\nFor doubling her SWE collegiate section’s activities, resulting in a significant increase in active membership, and extending the section’s outreach to students and professionals.

And many students are capitalizing on that growth by majoring in related fields. Even though STEM jobs tend to pay more than jobs in other industries, students still want to minimize how much they have to borrow in student loans. Those who don’t qualify for enough internal grants and scholarships can apply for STEM scholarships from third-party organizations and companies.\n\n[* 7 * WSOS Career and Technical Scholarship ------------------------------------- * _Amount_$6,000 * _Deadline_ October 16, 2025 WSOS provides Washington students with financial assistance, career training, and mentorship opportunities, aiming to help them succeed in high-demand, family-sustaining wage careers in the state. Most Opportunity Scholars are first-generation college students, women, or students of color, all pursuing a pathway to success in STEM and trade careers.

To be eligible, applicants must be entering their first year of graduate school in the fall of the year the](https://www.scholarships.com/scholarships/ams-graduate-fellowships)\n\nWhat is a STEM scholarship?\n---------------------------\n\nSTEM scholarships are designed for students interested in studying [computer science](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-major/computer-science-scholarships \"computer science\"), engineering, healthcare science and more. These scholarships may be sponsored by companies in the STEM field or organizations promoting STEM careers.\n\nBoth undergraduate and [graduate students](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-directory/school-year/graduate-school-1st-year \"graduate students\") can apply for STEM scholarships, though scholarships are more common for undergraduate students.\n\nSome STEM scholarships may only be given on a one-time basis, while others are guaranteed for a certain number of years. If a STEM scholarship renews for multiple years, you must generally maintain a minimum [Grade Point Average](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-directory/grade-point-average \"Grade Point Average\") (GPA) or keep a STEM-related major.\n\nHow to apply for a STEM Scholarship\n-----------------------------------\n\nApplying for a STEM scholarship is like applying for any other kind of scholarship. Make sure to read through the instructions carefully and submit everything by the [scholarship deadline](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-directory/deadline \"scholarship deadline\").\n\nThe essay portion may ask questions related to your interest in STEM. This is where you can highlight your passion. If you have to provide a recommendation letter, choose a teacher who can speak to your knowledge of STEM. This doesn’t have to be the teacher of a class where you earn the best grades - just someone you respect and have a good relationship with.\n\nIdeally, this teacher should also know about your enthusiasm for STEM. If you’re allowed to choose a non-teacher, you could even pick the sponsor for your robotics club or the supervisor at last summer’s internship.\n\nRemember to give the person you are asking a few weeks notice so they have enough time to write a high-quality letter. If you wait until the last minute, they might refuse or draft something generic.\n\nMany scholarships, including STEM scholarships, require that students submit the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://www.scholarships.com/fafsa \"Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)\") to be eligible.\n\nSTEM scholarship frequently asked questions\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWith myriad STEM scholarships available, it can be easy to get overwhelmed. Here’s what you should know about STEM scholarships before you apply:\n\n### Where can I find STEM scholarships?\n\nWhether you’re applying to college or are already enrolled, you can find STEM scholarships. These may be available through the general financial aid department or via a specific department. For example, if you’re majoring in engineering, the engineering department may have its own list of scholarships.\n\nAsk your academic advisor if they have any suggestions. You can also contact the financial aid department and ask them how to maximize your awards. You can also find a list of STEM scholarships at the [Scholarships.com directory](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-directory \"Scholarships.com directory\"), which can also help narrow down potential awards based on year in school, state and more.\n\n### Are there STEM scholarships for graduate students, including PhD students?\n\nMost scholarships you are going to find will be intended for students who are either incoming college students or are already enrolled in an undergraduate degree program. It’s considerably more difficult to find scholarships for graduate or PhD students. However, of the [graduate scholarships](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-grade-level/graduate-scholarships \"graduate scholarships\") that are available, a sizeable percentage of them are going to be for those with STEM or STEAM majors.\n\nSo take heart, there are still awards available - as long as you keep looking. For example, the [(ISC)² Graduate Scholarship](https://www.scholarships.com/scholarships/isc%C2%B2-graduate-cybersecurity-scholarship \"(ISC)² Graduate Scholarship\") program is available for students in a graduate or PhD program. Applicants must have a 3.5 GPA. Awards range between $1,000 and $5,000. Up to 20 winners may be selected each year.\n\nIf you’re currently in a graduate or PhD program, ask academic advisors and other staff members if they know of any scholarship opportunities. When you’re a grad student, it’s much more common to find fellowship and assistantship opportunities that can cover part or all of your tuition. These usually have a work component so they are not the same as a scholarship. However, they’re still a good way to graduate with as little in student loans as possible.\n\n### Are there special STEM scholarships for veterans?\n\nBoth current and former service members have access to a variety of scholarships. If you’re a veteran who is also interested in STEM, then you may be able to find special awards.\n\nVeterans who are paying for school with the Post 9/11 GI Bill may be eligible for the [Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship](https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/stem-scholarship/ \"Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship\"). You can receive up to $30,000 or nine months of training if you’re eligible.\n\nBoth undergraduate and graduate students may qualify. Also, dependents of veterans who are receiving the [Fry Bill](https://www.va.gov/education/survivor-dependent-benefits/fry-scholarship/ \"Fry Bill\") may also be eligible for this scholarship.\n\n### What are the best STEM scholarships?\n\nHaving a STEM background can make it easier to find a job after graduation, but it doesn’t guarantee that you won’t have a hard time paying back your [student loans](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/student-loans \"student loans\"). Thankfully, there are several generous scholarship programs for STEM students to reduce your debt burden.\n\nFor example, the Progress Software Mary Székely Scholarship is a $10,000 scholarship that can be renewed for up to four years. Like many STEM scholarships, this one is only available to [women](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/scholarships-for-women \"women\") who are planning to major in one of the following areas:\n\n*   [Computer Science](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-major/computer-science-scholarships \"Computer Science\")\n*   [Computer Engineering](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-directory/academic-major/computer-engineering \"Computer Engineering\")\n*   [IT and/or Information Systems](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-directory/academic-major/information-systems \"IT and/or Information Systems\")\n\nOnly [Massachusetts](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-state/massachusetts-scholarships \"Massachusetts\") residents are eligible for this award. You must also have a 3.2 high school GPA.\n\n### What kind of GPA do I need to apply for a STEM scholarship?\n\nEven though STEM scholarships can be extremely competitive, many students may meet the minimum requirements. For example, the [HBCU Week x AstraZeneca Scholarship](https://www.scholarships.com/scholarships/hbcu-week-x-astrazeneca-scholarship \"HBCU Week x AstraZeneca Scholarship\") is worth $25,000. Only students who are attending a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) are eligible. Students must have a 3.0 GPA to qualify.\n\nScholarships that accept both high school and college students may have higher GPA requirements for high school students than for college students. This depends on the particular scholarship and its requirements.\n\n### Are international students eligible for STEM scholarships?\n\nGetting a scholarship as an international student is often harder than it is for a student from the U.S. International students may find it easier to receive a tuition waiver instead of a direct scholarship. Normally, international students pay higher tuition rates than domestic students. A tuition waiver will let them pay the normal rate, which can save them thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nState schools may be more likely to offer tuition waivers to international students than private schools will tend to be.\n\n### Are there STEM scholarships for specific groups of students?\n\nMany organizations, companies and schools know that the STEM fields tend to be disproportionately white and male. That’s why there are often special scholarships to encourage diversity within the STEM industry.\n\nFor example, the [Society of Women Engineers](https://swe.org/scholarships/ \"Society of Women Engineers\") offers dozens of different scholarships for female students who are incoming freshmen or already enrolled in college. The good news? Students only have to complete one application to be considered for all scholarships they may be eligible for.\n\nThere are also scholarships for students from different ethnic or racial backgrounds. The [Blacks at Microsoft Scholarship](https://www.scholarships.com/scholarships/blacks-at-microsoft-scholarship \"Blacks at Microsoft Scholarship\") program provides awards for African-American students who are majoring in a STEM field. Five winners receive $5,000, which can be renewed for up to three years or until you have earned a bachelor’s degree. Forty-five $2,500 one-time awards are also given.\n\nOnly current [high school seniors](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-grade-level/high-school-scholarships/scholarships-for-high-school-seniors \"high school seniors\") who identify as African-American are eligible. Also, you must attend a four-year accredited school. You need to have a 3.0 GPA and have demonstrated financial need.\n\nYou must also be majoring in one of the following fields:\n\n*   Engineering\n*   Computer Science\n*   Computer Information Systems\n*   Business Administration, Finance, or Marketing\n\nThere are other scholarships for minorities in STEM. For example, the [SVCF Latinos in Technology Scholarship](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/stem-scholarships/svcf-latinos-in-technology-scholarship \"SVCF Latinos in Technology Scholarship\"), sponsored by the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, is given to Latino students who are interested in STEM. Applicants must have a 3.0 GPA and demonstrated financial need.\n\nOnly third and fourth-year college students are eligible; students must also be attending school full-time. The scholarship is worth $5,000 and can be renewed for up to three years. There are also professional development opportunities associated with this scholarship.\n\nApplicants must also be attending a school or be a high school graduate of a school in one of the following California counties:\n\n*   Alameda County\n*   Contra Costa County\n*   Marin County\n*   Napa County\n*   San Francisco County\n*   San Mateo County\n*   Santa Clara County\n*   Santa Cruz County\n*   Solano County\n*   Sonoma County\n*   Yolo County\n\n### How much is a STEM scholarship worth?\n\nThe average cost of a STEM degree depends on the specific major, whether you’re attending a public or private college and the length of the program. It’s not out of the realm of possibility to need to take out tens of thousands or even more than $100,000 in student loans to afford a STEM degree.\n\nFortunately, STEM students are eligible for generous scholarships. For example, the [Science Ambassador Scholarship](https://www.scholarships.com/scholarships/cards-against-humanity-science-ambassador-scholarship \"Science Ambassador Scholarship\") provides a free ride for a woman interested in a STEM degree. The winner will receive a scholarship for four years of university. To apply, you must create a three-minute video about a scientific topic that you’re uniquely interested in and passionate about.\n\nNot all STEM scholarships are this generous. However, if you’re lucky and persistent, you may receive enough aid to cover most of your college costs.\n\n### Do STEM scholarships have a need-based component?\n\nIn general, there are two main types of scholarships: merit awards and need-based awards. [Merit scholarships](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/academic-scholarships-and-merit-scholarships \"Merit scholarships\") do not look at a student's finances, only their academic, artistic, athletic or other achievements. In general, there are two main types of scholarships: merit awards and need-based awards. Merit awards do not look at a student's finances, only their academic, artistic, athletic or other achievements.\n\nNeed-based awards often also consider those factors, but will include a student’s financial need as a requirement. The definition of financial need may vary depending on the scholarship. Some may have a specific household income limit, whereas others will use information from the [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa \"FAFSA\").\n\nUnless a scholarship specifically states what it means by \"financial need\", and you explicitly don’t meet those qualifications, it doesn’t hurt to apply.\n\nFor example, the [Lockheed Martin STEM Scholarship](https://www.scholarships.com/scholarships/lockheed-martin-stem-scholarship-program \"Lockheed Martin STEM Scholarship\") is given to 200 students every year, and each award is worth $10,000. Also, the scholarships may come with a Lockheed Martin internship, which is another useful item to add to your resume.\n\nNot only do students need to have a 2.5 GPA or higher, they must also have demonstrated financial need to qualify for this award. Also, they have to be majoring in one of the following fields:\n\n*   Aerospace Engineering\n*   Computer Engineering\n*   Computer Science\n*   Electrical Engineering\n*   Electrical and Computer Engineering\n*   Industrial Engineering\n*   Mathematics\n*   Mechanical Engineering\n*   Physics\n\n### Do part-time students qualify for STEM scholarships?\n\nWhen you attend college, you’ll be labeled as a part-time, full-time or less than part-time student. This designation depends on how many credit hours you’re taking.\n\nIn general, it’s much easier to find scholarships when you’re a full-time student, which often means taking at least 12 credit hours.\n\nFor example, the [Generation Google Scholarship](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/generation-google-scholarship \"Generation Google Scholarship\") is only available for full-time students. This scholarship offers a $10,000 USD or $5,000 CAD award. Students must have demonstrated financial need and must be studying computer science, computer engineering or a similar field.\n\nThat’s not to say that part-time students can’t find financial aid though. It may just require more active searching on their end.\n",

Priyanka attends the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana.\nCan you tell us a little bit about Computer Engineering?\nComputer engineers are scientists who combine their knowledge of electricity, math, and computer sciences to think of new ways that computers can be used. We plan and create both hardware and software for computers.\nWhat inspired you to study Computer Engineering? How did you first become interested in STEM?\nI first became interested in STEM in high school. My high school was very STEM-oriented, and we were all exposed to STEM fields from a young age. I went about approaching STEM in a roundabout way, however.\nEvery year, Homecoming was a huge deal because of the sheer scale of the decorations, models, and performances we created. During my senior year, my class’s theme was “magic,” so I decided to build a robotic fortune-teller display. Since I was on a pretty strict budget, I used Legos, ping pong balls, a Raspberry Pi (a small computer I programmed), and a makeup practice head to build it. The cheeks, mouth, and eyeballs moved according to my design using small mechanical RC servos. I’m glad my first foray into electrical engineering in both hardware and software design was such a creative, challenging, and artistic project.\nI picked Computer Engineering as my major during my first year at Purdue University because I liked the idea of learning both hardware design and software design in one. I think it’s the perfect balance of breadth and depth across computer science and electrical engineering. I’ve always loved puzzling out logical problems, so I think it fits me well!\nPriyanka’s Robot\nWhat did you know about Computer Engineering when you were a child?\nWhen I was a child, and honestly up until I started college, I thought Computer Engineering was just people sitting at a desk and coding for long stretches of time. I didn’t know what the coding would involve, or how it would be applied. I pictured disparate logic puzzles or circuits that were inside phones and devices I knew about. I wasn’t wrong, I just didn’t understand the wide variety of possibilities Computer Engineering could entail.\nCan you tell us about some cool things that Computer Engineers are working on?\nSince Computer Engineering is a blend between electrical engineering and computer science, there are so many possibilities and cool things people work on! I know people who work in research labs on campus that investigate networking, optics, and integrated circuits. I also know that part of computer engineering involves embedded systems or programming the communication between hardware components in a larger electrical or mechanical system. That field really interests me. One cool thing I saw was that computer engineers work on electric bikes and cars on the internal processes between hardware components!\nWhat kinds of challenges have you encountered as a woman studying Computer Engineering?\nHere at Purdue, the ECE program has nearly the smallest percentage of women represented among all the engineering programs. In and of itself, that can be very intimidating. I remember in my very first lab after transitioning into my major, I was the only girl in my section of sixty people. Sometimes people can underestimate you and they assume that you aren’t smart enough. My favorite thing to do is to prove them wrong and set the curve or be the first one to get my circuit working!\nIn general, I think the best way to overcome that feeling of pressure or loneliness is to find your people. Find little pockets of community and support to work through difficult classes and situations you\nencounter as a woman in STEM! For me, it took some time to find my people, and it will take different people different amounts of time. Once you have it, you’ll have the support you need to make these challenges easier.\nCan you tell us about the importance of diversity in Computer Engineering?\nThere is an importance for diversity in Computer Engineering. As a field of engineering, our work is driven by creativity – and finding solutions to problems (the most elegant, ethical, simple, cheap, and sustainable solutions) is purely driven by individuals working together to be creative. Creativity isn’t something that just happens. It’s the result of making unexpected connections between things we already know. That means creativity depends on our life experiences. Without diversity, the life experiences we bring to an engineering problem are limited. Consequently, we may not find the best engineering solution. There are very few women and people from diverse backgrounds in engineering. This is especially true in Computer Engineering.  It’s important that we have a workforce that represents everyone!\nOne barrier that is often pointed to is the lack of role models women and people from diverse backgrounds can relate to in the field. Because the number of women in the field is low, there are also few women leaders in engineering, which can make it difficult for new generations of female engineers to find mentors with whom they can relate to. This Catch-22 is a hard one to resolve, as the best way to increase representative leadership in engineering is by encouraging more women to enter the field! It’s important to recognize that everyone has valuable contributions to bring to the table in Computer Engineering. We all have different approaches to problems and that comes from how we learn, how we were taught, and that varies based on your background.\nWhat do you love about Purdue University and its Computer Engineering Program?\nMy favorite part about being a Purdue student is being part of Purdue’s chapter of the Society of Women Engineers! Some of my favorite memories from being on campus include our Outreach events with students interested in STEM and engineering. We volunteer and plan events like SWEekend, where high school seniors shadow a SWE member to their classes for a day and stay over in the dorms!\nMore specifically, my favorite part about our Computer Engineering program is the community we share. I love sitting with people in our building and working late nights, completing problems on the whiteboards and debugging code and circuits together!\nMeet Nishalini, Computer Engineering Student at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia.\nNishalini is a senior Computer Engineering Student. She attends the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Nishalini plans to graduate in May of 2022.\nCan you tell us a little about what Computer Engineering is and what studying Computer Engineering is like?\nI like to tell others that Computer Engineering is when you combine Electrical Engineering and Computer Science into one major. Computer Engineering can include coding like a Computer Science major and/or working with hardware and circuits like an electrical engineering major. Computer Engineering really focuses on the question of how computers work and what is in our computers. We learn about this in computer architecture classes.\nWhat made you decide to study Computer Engineering?\nI always liked STEM since high school and middle school. I was on the Science Olympiad all four years of high school, and I participated in a lot of different events like experimental design and robot arm. When I got into Georgia Tech, I got in as an Electrical Engineering major. To be honest, at the time, there wasn’t a good reason why I chose electrical engineering. I like robotics and circuits but that was about it. During my second year at Georgia Tech, I wanted to get better at coding, and I liked software, so I switched to Computer Engineering. I really like Computer Engineering instead of Computer Science because I get to work with the hardware and write code specifically for hardware. Computer Science is more focused on writing algorithms and data structures.\nWhat are some cool things that Computer Engineers work on?\nThe great part about computer engineering is that I feel like people in my profession work on a lot of different things in a lot of different fields. Some people focus on computer architecture after graduating and learn how to make computers better (run faster, not crash, etc.). Some people write code and create circuits for robots and aircraft. Some people go into cybersecurity and machine learning. People who study computer engineering work for a lot of different companies in a lot of different fields, including Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and many other companies.\nTell us about a time when you failed. How did you move on from that?\nThere are a lot of times I have failed. I failed my circuits class during my second year, and I had to retake it over the summer. I also applied to multiple internships these past few months, and I received a lot of rejections. I got rejected after interviewing with Apple, Tesla, Facebook, and Qualcomm. I have mostly gotten rejected because I need more practice with technical interviews. I am hoping that I can spend this summer practicing and preparing for technical interviews, so I can pass them when I apply again next year. There is always time to learn, grow, and get better, so don’t give up or think that it is too late.\nCan you describe a day in your life studying Computer Engineering?\nMy day to day varies. But I can describe what my day was like yesterday. Yesterday, I had my Technology Entrepreneurship class from 8:25-10:20AM. We have general body meetings on Thursdays at 11AM for Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering. This meeting was an information session with Volvo and free lunch was provided. So, I went to that meeting from 11AM – 12PM with one of my woman Computer Engineering friends.\nI had my Advanced Computer Architecture class from 12:30-1:45PM. I work part-time at the Advanced Controls and Communication Branch at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). I walked to the GTRI after class and worked until 7PM. I am also a resident assistant at a freshman dorm. So, I went back home to my dorm room, and picked up the duty bag because I was on duty that night. And then I spent the rest of the evening doing homework until I went to bed. I would consider that a pretty busy “day in the life.” But, as I said before, it varies. Other days I have a lot more free time to relax and do other fun things I enjoy.\nWhat do you love most about Georgia Tech and its Computer Engineering Program?\nGeorgia Tech has a lot of supportive communities and helpful people. Most people want to help you, whether it is your professor, teaching assistants, peers, and so on. I especially love how supportive the Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering (WECE) organization is to ECE women. WECE provides academic and professional guidance, as well as allows ECE members to meet each other outside of their classes and majors. I also like how diverse the electives are in the Computer Engineering program because it allows you to explore a lot of different fields in computer engineering (computer architecture, signal processing, robotics, embedded systems, etc.) before you head out into the real world.\nCan you share some advice for our readers who may be considering going to school for Computer Engineering?\nComputer Engineering is a difficult major, and a lot of people struggle with it in the beginning or struggle throughout the entire program. I truly believe that anyone has the capability to get a computer engineering degree. You don’t have to be the smartest person in your high school or middle school classes. You don’t need to be valedictorian or have a 4.0 GPA. Also, it is never too late to get into STEM. Even if you didn’t do well in your chemistry or calculus classes in high school. Getting a degree in Computer Engineering (or any engineering) is about perseverance and motivation rather than sheer intelligence. Try your best. Always move forward despite moments of failure. Meet as many different people as you can. Make connections – in industry, research, and academia. Make a lot of friends in your classes – this will help you feel more supported and less like you are going through this degree alone. If you do all of that, I am confident you will succeed and graduate with a Computer Engineering degree.\nMeet Megan, Computer Science and Environmental Economics and Policy Student at the University of California Berkeley in Berkeley, California.\nMegan is first year student double majoring in Computer Science and Environmental Economics and Policy at the University of California Berkeley in Berkeley, California.\nWhat inspired you to study Computer Science and Environmental Economics and Policy?\nWhen I was a kid, the only thing I knew was how to use YouTube, Netflix, and clicking a few buttons to play games online! Despite growing up in the Bay Area, I was never involved in coding from a young age. In fact, I took my first Computer Science class during my last year of high school. Computer Science was never on my radar until high school! I love learning about systems and interdisciplinary topics; realizing that I can apply Computer Science to all the fields I’m interested in piqued my interest. As I began to learn more about not only the applications of Computer Science but also the growing importance of technology in everything, everywhere, I knew that I wanted a degree in Computer Science.\nCan you tell us about your typical day studying Computer Science and Environmental Economics and Policy?\nI’m usually on campus by 9AM or 10AM for class. Afterwards, I meet up with some friends for lunch before I go to our famous Doe Library, Memorial Glade, Sather Tower, or coffee shops to study. Sometimes, I stop by my sorority house to meet friends for dinner. I try to finish all schoolwork by 7-8PM. Sometimes I spend a few hours working extracurricular activities before doing my nighttime routine. Right now, I’m working on a notoriously difficult but interesting project—creating the WW2 German Enigma machine which uses an advanced algorithm to code/decode messages. I’ve worked on some environmental and public health, renewable energy economics research, and COVID-19 data analysis and visualizations projects for clubs and other organizations.\nWhat do you like about your programs at UC Berkeley?\nI LOVE the people at UC Berkeley! Every single time I walk to class and see my peers discussing their interests, walk through Sather Gate, or bask in the Sun on Memorial Glade, I must pause to fully process the fact that I’m attending the #1 public university in the WORLD. I’m constantly surrounded by the most brilliant minds, opportunities, and people. Many of my friends are Valedictorians and/or are working on cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence and Robotics projects, while many tech consulting clubs work with FAANG and startups. I can explore anything I want while living in one of the most dynamic cities in the country! I knew UC Berkeley was special, but my experience thus far exceeds all expectations. This is the school of my dreams, and my Computer Science program is filled with the most hard-working people I’ve ever met.\nCan you share anything about challenges you have faced as a woman in STEM?\nDespite attending a top university and being in one of the biggest Computer Science programs in the world, I encounter many challenges as a woman in STEM. There is a massive gender gap in Computer Science classes, including our famous CS61A with 1,500+ students. This gap expands in more advanced courses; lecture halls can feel very intimidating with such overwhelming lack of women in Computer Science. Although most of my male counterparts are great teammates, some boys that express toxic masculinity disrupt the welcoming learning environment. Dealing with such people and encounters can be mentally draining and often leaves me exhausted. Leaning on my network of fellow women in STEM – particularly women also studying Computer Science – and male allies re-energizes my interest and commitment to succeeding in this field! Venting to friends helps me express my frustrations. Looking up to mentors and other women that persevered inspires me to do the same for future generations of female Computer Scientists!\nCan you tell us about a time when you failed? How did you come back from that?\nAs a scientist and engineer, I fail relatively frequently but do my best to learn from my mistakes and become better! One time, I got a 20% on an exam. Of course, getting such a low score was very, very disappointing and disheartening; I began to wonder if I should continue with my Computer Science degree, and imposter syndrome started to manifest. Friends, classmates, and other women in STEM were my lifeline! We shared stories about times we failed, ways we coped, and potential changes in our studying strategies so we succeed next time. Failure never feels good, but it’s the best way we can refine our studying skills, become more efficient and effective learners, and practice courage to try again! Building perseverance and patience with oneself is the key to succeeding in anything.\nWhat advice can you share for our SWENexters who might be interested in studying Computer Engineering or Computer Science?\nJust jump into it! This might sound trivial, but it’s the best way to get involved with Computer Science! The interdisciplinary nature, various sub-fields, and overall breadth of Computer Science can feel very intimating, especially for women. Pick one programming language (I’d recommend Python to start with), learn the very basic fundamentals of data structures and algorithms, and try to build a project. Above all, be curious and creative about ways you can apply your skills to create or improve something. Be patient with yourself through the learning process. Do what you love and watch your genuine interest in learning blossom into something bigger than you could’ve imagined.\nAuthors\nSWE Blog (https://alltogether.swe.org/author/jjacks/)\nSWE Blog provides up-to-date information and news about the Society and how our members are making a difference every day.
