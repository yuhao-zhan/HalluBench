Johnny Depp (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136/?ref_=ls_t_1)\nActor\nProducer\nDirector\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/?ref_=ls_knf_1)\nJohn Christopher \"Johnny\" Depp II was born on June 9, 1963 in Owensboro, Kentucky, to Betty Sue Palmer (née Wells), a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer. He was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named 'The Kids'. When he married\nLori A. Depp (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0220129/?ls)\n, he took a job as a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor\nNicolas Cage (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/?ls)\n, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp's film debut in the low-budget horror film,\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087800/?ls)\n, where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.\nIn 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced\nJeff Yagher (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0944891/?ls)\nin the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series\n21 Jump Street (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092312/?ls)\n. In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director\nTim Burton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000318/?ls)\ncame about when Depp played the title role in\nEdward Scissorhands (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099487/?ls)\n. Following the film's success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of\nEd Wood (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109707/?ls)\n. In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film\nDonnie Brasco (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119008/?ls)\n, opposite\nAl Pacino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/?ls)\n; in 1998 he appeared in\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120669/?ls)\n, directed by\nTerry Gilliam (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/?ls)\n; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film\nThe Astronaut's Wife (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138304/?ls)\n. The same year he teamed up again with Burton in\nSleepy Hollow (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162661/?ls)\n, brilliantly portraying Ichabod Crane.\nDepp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in\nFrom Hell (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120681/?ls)\n. He stole the show from screen greats such as\nAntonio Banderas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000104/?ls)\nin the finale to\nRobert Rodriguez (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/?ls)\n's \"mariachi\" trilogy,\nOnce Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285823/?ls)\n. In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/?ls)\n, playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film's enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the\nStephen King (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000175/?ls)\n-based movie,\nSecret Window (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363988/?ls)\n; as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based\nFinding Neverland (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308644/?ls)\n, where he co-starred with\nKate Winslet (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000701/?ls)\n; and Rochester in the British film,\nThe Libertine (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375920/?ls)\n. Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of\nRoald Dahl (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001094/?ls)\n's novel,\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367594/?ls)\n, and later in\nAlice in Wonderland (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014759/?ls)\nand\nDark Shadows (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1077368/?ls)\n.\nOff-screen, Depp has dated several female celebrities, and has been engaged to\nSherilyn Fenn (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000145/?ls)\n,\nJennifer Grey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000426/?ls)\n,\nWinona Ryder (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000213/?ls)\nand\nKate Moss (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0609017/?ls)\n. He was married to Lori Anne Allison in 1983, but divorced her in 1985. Depp has two children with his former long-time partner, French singer/actress\nVanessa Paradis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0660854/?ls)\n: Lily-Rose Melody, born in 1999 and John Christopher \"Jack\" III, born in 2002.

Arnold Schwarzenegger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/?ref_=ls_t_2)\nActor\nProducer\nWriter\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/?ref_=ls_knf_2)\nWith an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick Austrian accent, who\nwould have ever believed that a brash, quick talking bodybuilder from a\nsmall European village would become one of Hollywood's biggest stars,\nmarry into the prestigious Kennedy family, amass a fortune via shrewd\ninvestments and one day be the Governor of California!?\nThe amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true \"rags to\nriches\" tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of\nopportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to\nAurelia Schwarzenegger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9134375/?ls)\n(born Jadrny) and Gustav\nSchwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a\nkeen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete\nin several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated\nto the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star\nbegan to rise.\nUp until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather\noddball sport, or even a mis-understood \"freak show\" by the general\npublic, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers\nBen Weider (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2366221/?ls)\nand\nJoe Weider (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0917755/?ls)\nset about broadening the appeal of\n\"pumping iron\" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster\nboy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \"Austrian\nOak\", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in\n1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding\nwinning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with\nit, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new\ninternational audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide\nswelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire\nflourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe.\nHowever, Schwarzenegger's horizons were bigger than just the landscape\nof bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \"Arnold Strong\" in the low\nbudget\nHercules in New York (1970) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065832/?ls)\n,\nthen director\nBob Rafelson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0706182/?ls)\ncast Arnold in\nStay Hungry (1976) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075268/?ls)\nalongside\nJeff Bridges (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000313/?ls)\nand\nSally Field (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000398/?ls)\n, for which Arnold won a Golden\nGlobe Award for \"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\". The\nmesmerizing\nPumping Iron (1977) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/?ls)\ncovering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on\nto become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus\nArnold landed other acting roles in the comedy\nThe Villain (1979) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080097/?ls)\nopposite\nKirk Douglas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000018/?ls)\n, and he portrayed\nMickey Hargitay (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0362927/?ls)\nin the well- received TV\nmovie\nThe Jayne Mansfield Story (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080947/?ls)\n.\nWhat Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a\nlavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him\nroom to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor.\nConan the Barbarian (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082198/?ls)\nwas just that role. Inspired by the\nRobert E. Howard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397574/?ls)\nshort stories of the\n\"Hyborean Age\" and directed by gung ho director\nJohn Milius (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587518/?ls)\n, and with a largely unknown\ncast, save\nMax von Sydow (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001884/?ls)\nand\nJames Earl Jones (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000469/?ls)\n, \"Conan\" was a smash\nhit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled\nConan the Destroyer (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087078/?ls)\nquickly followed. If \"Conan\" was the kick start to Arnold's movie\ncareer, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and\naccelerate his star status into overdrive. Director\nJames Cameron (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000116/?ls)\nhad until that time\nonly previously directed one earlier feature film titled\nPiranha II: The Spawning (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082910/?ls)\n, which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for\nan actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator -\nThe Terminator (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/?ls)\n. Made on a\nrelatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction\nthriller\nThe Terminator (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/?ls)\nwas\nincredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable\nfilm franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \"I'll be back\" quickly\nbecame part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in\nvogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold\nreap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals\nwho used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done.\nThe testosterone laden\nCommando (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088944/?ls)\n,\nRaw Deal (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091828/?ls)\n,\nPredator (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/?ls)\n,\nThe Running Man (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093894/?ls)\nand\nRed Heat (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095963/?ls)\nwere all box office hits\nand Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking\nwinning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy\nTwins (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096320/?ls)\nwith co-star\nDanny DeVito (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000362/?ls)\nwas a smash and won Arnold new\nfans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once\ndescribed by Australian author / TV host\nClive James (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0416380/?ls)\nas \"a condom stuffed with\nwalnuts\". The spectacular\nTotal Recall (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100802/?ls)\nand \"feel good\"\nKindergarten Cop (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099938/?ls)\nwere\nboth solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to\nreturn to familiar territory with director\nJames Cameron (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000116/?ls)\nin\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/?ls)\n.\nThe second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget\nhad grown from the initial film's $6.5 million to an alleged $100\nmillion for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel\nbristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases & stunt\nsequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery.\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/?ls)\nwas arguably the zenith of Arnold's film career to date and he was\nvoted \"International Star of the Decade\" by the National Association of\nTheatre Owners.\nRemarkably, his next film\nLast Action Hero (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107362/?ls)\nbrought\nArnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but\nconfusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood\naction film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in\ndroves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned\nback to good friend, director\nJames Cameron (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000116/?ls)\nand the chemistry\nwas definitely still there as the \"James Bond\" style spy thriller\nTrue Lies (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111503/?ls)\nco-starring\nJamie Lee Curtis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000130/?ls)\nand\nTom Arnold (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000792/?ls)\nwas the surprise hit of\n1994! Following the broad audience appeal of\nTrue Lies (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111503/?ls)\n, Schwarzenegger\ndecided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with\nJunior (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110216/?ls)\nand\nJingle All the Way (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116705/?ls)\n, but\nhe still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with\nEraser (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116213/?ls)\n, as the chilling \"Mr.\nFreeze\" in\nBatman & Robin (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/?ls)\nand battling dark forces in the supernatural action of\nEnd of Days (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146675/?ls)\n. The science\nfiction / conspiracy tale\nThe 6th Day (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216216/?ls)\nplayed to only\nmediocre fan interest, and\nCollateral Damage (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233469/?ls)\nhad\nits theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic\nevents of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm\nreception.\nIt was time again to resurrect Arnold's most successful franchise and,\nin 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time\nfor\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181852/?ls)\n.\nUnfortunately, directorial duties passed from\nJames Cameron (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000116/?ls)\nto\nJonathan Mostow (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0609236/?ls)\nand the deletion of the\ncharacter of \"Sarah Connor\" aka\nLinda Hamilton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000157/?ls)\nand a change in\nthe actor playing \"John Connor\" -\nNick Stahl (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001763/?ls)\ntook over from\nEdward Furlong (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000411/?ls)\n- making\nthe third entry in the \"Terminator\" series the weakest to date.\nSchwarzenegger married TV journalist\nMaria Shriver (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005425/?ls)\nin April, 1986 and the\ncouple have four children.\nIn October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected\nGovernor of California in a special recall election of then governor\nGray Davis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204665/?ls)\n. The \"Governator,\" as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held\nthe office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor's mansion it was\nrevealed that he had fathered a child with the family's live-in maid\nand Shriver filed for divorce.\nSchwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to\nThe Rundown (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327850/?ls)\n,\nAround the World in 80 Days (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327437/?ls)\nand\nThe Kid & I (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416891/?ls)\n.

The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to\nfame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy\nIn Living Color (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098830/?ls)\nbut\nleading roles in\nAce Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109040/?ls)\n,\nDumb and Dumber (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109686/?ls)\nand\nThe Mask (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110475/?ls)\nestablished him as a\nbankable comedy actor.\nJames Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962 in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of four children of Kathleen (Oram), a homemaker,\nand Percy Carrey, an accountant and jazz musician. The family surname\nwas originally \"Carré\", and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish\nancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child,\nhe performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed\nhis résumé to\nThe Carol Burnett Show (1967) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061240/?ls)\nat age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the\nend of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates\n(provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).\nCarrey's early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when\nthe family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to\nScarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial\njobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after\nschool let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered).\nWhen they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a\nVolkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.\nCarrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and\nsiblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful)\nprofessional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk's, one of the many local clubs\nthat would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He\ndropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations\n(among them\nMichael Landon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001446/?ls)\nand\nJames Stewart (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000071/?ls)\n), and in 1979 worked\nup the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular\ngig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed\nRodney Dangerfield (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001098/?ls)\nso much that the\nveteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During\nthis period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he\nhad a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy\ndivorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress\nLauren Holly (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000452/?ls)\n. Wary of falling into the\nlounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance\noutlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived\nsitcom\nThe Duck Factory (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086702/?ls)\n;\nwhile the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to\npursue acting more vigorously.\nCarrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored\nthe male lead in the ill-received\nLauren Hutton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001381/?ls)\nvehicle\nOnce Bitten (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089730/?ls)\n, and had a\nsupporting role in\nPeggy Sue Got Married (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091738/?ls)\n,\nbefore making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc\nin\nEarth Girls Are Easy (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097257/?ls)\n.\nImpressed with Carrey's lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial\nDamon Wayans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001834/?ls)\nmade a call to his brother,\nKeenen Ivory Wayans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005540/?ls)\n, who was in the\nprocess of putting together the sketch comedy show\nIn Living Color (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098830/?ls)\n.\nCarrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with\noutrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire\nMarshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill-\nadvised safety tips).\nFollowing his time on\nIn Living Color (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098830/?ls)\n,\nCarrey's transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened\nwithin the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn\nin\nAce Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109040/?ls)\n,\na film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the\ncharacter's trademark was talking out his derrière). Next up was the\nmanic superhero movie\nThe Mask (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110475/?ls)\n,\nwhich had audiences wondering just how far Carrey's features could\nstretch.\nFinally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the\nFarrelly brothers'\nDumb and Dumber (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109686/?ls)\n(his first\nmulti-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought\nhis manic antics onto the set of\nBatman Forever (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112462/?ls)\n, replacing\nRobin Williams (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245/?ls)\nas The Riddler. He\nalso filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough,\nAce Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112281/?ls)\n,\nand inked a deal with Sony to star in\nThe Cable Guy (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115798/?ls)\n(replacing\nChris Farley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000394/?ls)\n) for a cool $20\nmillion--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been\noffered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a\ndisappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced\nback the next year with the energetic hit\nLiar Liar (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119528/?ls)\n. Worried that his\ncomic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.\nIn 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in\nPeter Weir (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001837/?ls)\n's\nThe Truman Show (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/?ls)\nplaying a\nnaive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a\nTV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took\nmoviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and\nfans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn't\nmaterialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their\nnarrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey\nthrew himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a\nhandful of other hopefuls (including\nEdward Norton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001570/?ls)\n) to play eccentric\nfunnyman\nAndy Kaufman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001412/?ls)\nin\nMan on the Moon (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125664/?ls)\n, Carrey\ndisappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery\nalter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman's bongo\ndrums, which he'd used during his audition for director\nMilos Forman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001232/?ls)\n). His sometimes uncanny\nimpersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again\nthe Academy kept quiet.\nAn indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly\nbrothers in\nMe, Myself & Irene (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183505/?ls)\n,\nplaying a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall\nin love with the same woman\n(\nRenée Zellweger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000250/?ls)\n). Carrey's real-life\npersona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film\nwrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then,\nCarrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy\nantihero of\nRon Howard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/?ls)\n's\nHow the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170016/?ls)\n.\nAlthough Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films\nsuch as\nBruce Almighty (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315327/?ls)\nand\nMr. Popper's Penguins (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396218/?ls)\n,\nhe is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as\ndemonstrated in films like\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/?ls)\nand the drama/comedy\nYes Man (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068680/?ls)\n. In\n2013, he costars with\nSteve Carell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0136797/?ls)\nin\nThe Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790628/?ls)\n.\nCarrey has one child with his first wife,\nMelissa Carrey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0140314/?ls)\n, whom he divorced in 1995.\nHe married actress\nLauren Holly (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000452/?ls)\nin 1996,\nbut they split less than a year later.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/?ref_=ls_i_4)\n4. Leonardo DiCaprio (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/?ref_=ls_t_4)\nProducer\nActor\nWriter\nInception (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/?ref_=ls_knf_4)\nFew actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom\nGrowing Pains (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088527/?ls)\nand low budget horror movies, such as\nCritters 3 (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101627/?ls)\n, to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as\nRomeo + Juliet (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117509/?ls)\nand\nTitanic (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/?ls)\n, to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as\nMartin Scorsese (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000217/?ls)\nand\nChristopher Nolan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/?ls)\n.\nLeonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of\nIrmelin DiCaprio (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2638069/?ls)\n(née Indenbirken) and former comic book artist\nGeorge DiCaprio (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1096247/?ls)\n. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German, Ukrainian and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.\nDiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as\nRoseanne (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094540/?ls)\nand\nThe New Lassie (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096661/?ls)\n, but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in\nCritters 3 (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101627/?ls)\n, a low-budget horror movie. While\nCritters 3 (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101627/?ls)\ndid little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom\nGrowing Pains (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088527/?ls)\n, in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on\nGrowing Pains (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088527/?ls)\nwas very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.\nLeonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in\nWhat's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108550/?ls)\n, a young gunslinger in\nThe Quick and the Dead (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114214/?ls)\nand a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in\nThe Basketball Diaries (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112461/?ls)\n, a role which the late\nRiver Phoenix (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000203/?ls)\noriginally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as Romeo Montague in\nBaz Luhrmann (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525303/?ls)\n's\nRomeo + Juliet (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117509/?ls)\nthat Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers,\nTitanic (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/?ls)\n, which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time,\nTitanic (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/?ls)\nbecame the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on\nTitanic (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/?ls)\n, DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in\nThe Man in the Iron Mask (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120744/?ls)\nand the low-budget\nThe Beach (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163978/?ls)\nbeing some of his few notable roles during this period.\nIn 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in\nCatch Me If You Can (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464/?ls)\nand\nGangs of New York (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217505/?ls)\n, his first of many collaborations with director\nMartin Scorsese (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000217/?ls)\n. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as\nThe Departed (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/?ls)\n,\nShutter Island (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/?ls)\nand\nChristopher Nolan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/?ls)\n's\nInception (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/?ls)\n, DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors.\nIn 2012, he played a mustache twirling villain in\nDjango Unchained (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728/?ls)\n, and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in\nThe Great Gatsby (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343092/?ls)\nand Jordan Belfort in\nThe Wolf of Wall Street (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/?ls)\n.\nDiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/?ref_=ls_i_5)\n5.

Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history.\nTom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted to become a priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in\nEndless Love (1981) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082329/?ls)\nand from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences.\nWith handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top-grossing films of the 1980s including\nTop Gun (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/?ls)\n;\nThe Color of Money (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090863/?ls)\n,\nRain Man (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/?ls)\nand\nBorn on the Fourth of July (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096969/?ls)\n.

Tom Cruise's biggest franchise, Mission Impossible, has also earned a total of 3 billion dollars worldwide. Tom Cruise has also shown lots of interest in producing, with his biggest producer credits being the Mission Impossible franchise.\nIn 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress\nNicole Kidman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000173/?ls)\nuntil 2001. Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has indeed come a long way from the lonely wanderings of his youth to become one of the biggest movie stars ever.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/?ref_=ls_i_6)\n6.

Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.\nHe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is former U.S. Representative\nMike Capuano (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4576629/?ls)\n. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister,\nCarly Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2869049/?ls)\n, and two younger siblings, a brother named\nScott Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3268924/?ls)\n, who is also an actor, and a sister named\nShana Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4974640/?ls)\n. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the\nLee Strasberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833448/?ls)\nTheatre Institute.\nOn the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on\nThe Fugitive (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247097/?ls)\n(CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring\nHarrison Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/?ls)\n.

Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\n, a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life.

Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.\nThe year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance.\nThe Nanny Diaries (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489237/?ls)\n, where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive.

At Kickapoo High School, he was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for El Pollo Loco.\nPitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera\nAnother World (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057731/?ls)\nbefore appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera\nDallas (1978) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077000/?ls)\n. Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in\nThelma & Louise (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103074/?ls)\n, in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned\nGeena Davis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000133/?ls)\n. This led to starring roles in badly received films such as\nJohnny Suede (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104567/?ls)\n&\nCool World (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104009/?ls)\n.\nBut Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in\nA River Runs Through It (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105265/?ls)\n, which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt's subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in\nTrue Romance (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108399/?ls)\nto romantic roles in such visually lavish films as\nInterview with the Vampire (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110148/?ls)\nand\nLegends of the Fall (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110322/?ls)\n, to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller\nSe7en (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/?ls)\n. His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in\n12 Monkeys (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/?ls)\nwon him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.\nPitt's portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama\nTroy (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/?ls)\nhelped establish his appeal as an action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick\nMr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356910/?ls)\n. It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married\nJennifer Aniston (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000098/?ls)\nin a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met\nAngelina Jolie (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001401/?ls)\n. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence.\nHe continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as\nMegamind (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001526/?ls)\nto adventurous critic-bait like\nInglourious Basterds (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/?ls)\nand\nThe Tree of Life (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478304/?ls)\n.

Charles Chaplin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000122/?ref_=ls_t_11)\nWriter\nActor\nDirector\nThe Great Dictator (1940) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032553/?ref_=ls_knf_11)\nConsidered to be one of the most pivotal stars of the early days of Hollywood, Charlie Chaplin lived an interesting life both in his films and behind the camera. He is most recognized as an icon of the silent film era, often associated with his popular character, the Little Tramp; the man with the toothbrush mustache, bowler hat, bamboo cane, and a funny walk.\nCharles Spencer Chaplin was born in Walworth, London, England on April 16, 1889, to Hannah Harriet Pedlingham (Hill) and Charles Chaplin, both music hall performers, who were married on June 22, 1885. After Charles Sr. separated from Hannah to perform in New York City, Hannah then tried to resurrect her stage career. Unfortunately, her singing voice had a tendency to break at unexpected moments. When this happened, the stage manager spotted young Charlie standing in the wings and led him on stage, where five-year-old Charlie began to sing a popular tune. Charlie and his half-brother,\nSyd Chaplin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152260/?ls)\nspent their lives in and out of charity homes and workhouses between their mother's bouts of insanity. Hannah was committed to Cane Hill Asylum in May 1903 and lived there until 1921, when Chaplin moved her to California.\nChaplin began his official acting career at the age of eight, touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads. At age 18, he began touring with\nFred Karno (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0439833/?ls)\n's vaudeville troupe, joining them on the troupe's 1910 United States tour. He traveled west to California in December 1913 and signed on with Keystone Studios' popular comedy director\nMack Sennett (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784407/?ls)\n, who had seen Chaplin perform on stage in New York. Charlie soon wrote his brother Syd, asking him to become his manager. While at Keystone, Chaplin appeared in and directed 35 films, starring as the Little Tramp in nearly all.\nIn November 1914, he left Keystone and signed on at Essanay, where he made 15 films. In 1916, he signed on at Mutual and made 12 films. In June 1917, Chaplin signed up with First National Studios, after which he built Chaplin Studios. In 1919, he and\nDouglas Fairbanks (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001196/?ls)\n,\nMary Pickford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0681933/?ls)\nand\nD.W. Griffith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000428/?ls)\nformed United Artists (UA).\nChaplin's life and career was full of scandal and controversy. His first big scandal was during World War I, at which time his loyalty to England, his home country, was questioned. He had never applied for American citizenship, but claimed that he was a \"paying visitor\" to the United States. Many British citizens called Chaplin a coward and a slacker. This and other career eccentricities sparked suspicion with FBI chief\nJ. Edgar Hoover (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393890/?ls)\nand the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), who believed that he was injecting Communist propaganda into his films. Chaplin's later film\nThe Great Dictator (1940) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032553/?ls)\n, which was his first \"talkie\", also created a stir. In the film, Chaplin plays a humorous caricature of\nAdolf Hitler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386944/?ls)\n. Some thought the film was poorly done and in bad taste. However, the film grossed over $5 million and earned five Academy Award Nominations.\nAnother scandal occurred when Chaplin briefly dated 22 year-old Joan Barry. However, Chaplin's relationship with Barry came to an end in 1942, after a series of harassing actions from her. In May 1943, Barry returned to inform Chaplin that she was pregnant and filed a paternity suit, claiming that the unborn child was his. During the 1944 trial, blood tests proved that Chaplin was not the father, but at the time, blood tests were inadmissible evidence, and he was ordered to pay $75 a week until the child turned 21.\nChaplin also was scrutinized for his support in aiding the Russian struggle against the invading Nazis during World War II, and the United States government questioned his moral and political views, suspecting him of having Communist ties. For this reason, HUAC subpoenaed him in 1947. However, HUAC finally decided that it was no longer necessary for him to appear for testimony. Conversely, when Chaplin and his family traveled to London for the premier of\nLimelight (1952) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044837/?ls)\n, he was denied re-entry to the United States. In reality, the government had almost no evidence to prove that he was a threat to national security. Instead, he and his wife decided to settle in Switzerland.\nChaplin was married four times and had a total of 11 children. In 1918, he married\nMildred Harris (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0365121/?ls)\nand they had a son together, Norman Spencer Chaplin, who lived only three days. Chaplin and Harris divorced in 1920. He married\nLita Grey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340614/?ls)\nin 1924, who had two sons,\nCharles Chaplin Jr. (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152224/?ls)\nand\nSydney Chaplin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152261/?ls)\n. They were divorced in 1927. In 1936, Chaplin married\nPaulette Goddard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002104/?ls)\n, and his final marriage was to Oona O'Neill (\nOona Chaplin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152253/?ls)\n), daughter of playwright\nEugene O'Neill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0642156/?ls)\nin 1943. Oona gave birth to eight children:\nGeraldine Chaplin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001036/?ls)\n,\nMichael Chaplin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152249/?ls)\n,\nJosephine Chaplin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152245/?ls)\n,\nVictoria Chaplin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152265/?ls)\n, Eugene Chaplin, Jane Chaplin, Annette-Emilie Chaplin, and\nChristopher Chaplin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152237/?ls)\n.\nIn contrast to many of his boisterous characters, Chaplin was a quiet man who kept to himself a great deal. He also had an \"un-millionaire\" way of living. Even after he had accumulated millions, he continued to live in shabby accommodations. In 1921, Chaplin was decorated by the French government for his outstanding work as a filmmaker and was elevated to the rank of Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1952. In 1972, he was honored with an Academy Award for his \"incalculable effect in making motion pictures the art form of the century\". He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1975 New Year's Honours List. No formal reason for the honour was listed. The citation simply reads \"Charles Spencer Chaplin, Film Actor and Producer\".\nChaplin's other works included musical scores that he composed for many of his films. He also authored two autobiographical books, \"My Autobiography\" (1964) and its companion volume, \"My Life in Pictures\" (1974).\nChaplin died at age 88 of natural causes on December 25, 1977 at his home in Vevey, Switzerland. His funeral was a small and private Anglican ceremony according to his wishes. In 1978, Chaplin's corpse was stolen from its grave and was not recovered for three months; he was re-buried in a vault surrounded by cement.\nSix of Chaplin's films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress: The Immigrant (1917),\nThe Kid (1921) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012349/?ls)\n,\nThe Gold Rush (1925) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015864/?ls)\n,\nCity Lights (1931) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021749/?ls)\n,\nModern Times (1936) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027977/?ls)\n, and\nThe Great Dictator (1940) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032553/?ls)\n.\nCharlie Chaplin is considered one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of American cinema, whose movies were and still are popular throughout the world and have even gained notoriety as time progresses. His films show, through the Little Tramp's positive outlook on life in a world full of chaos, that the human spirit has and always will remain the same.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/?ref_=ls_i_12)\n12.

He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started.\nRon Howard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/?ls)\nwas working on\nSplash (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088161/?ls)\n, a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, which eventually went to\nJohn Candy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001006/?ls)\n. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy\nDragnet (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092925/?ls)\n, Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy\nBig (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094737/?ls)\nestablished him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.\nHanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in\nA League of Their Own (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104694/?ls)\n. Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with\nSleepless in Seattle (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108160/?ls)\nand then with\nPhiladelphia (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107818/?ls)\n. The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.\nIn Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.\nHanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster\nForrest Gump (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/?ls)\nwhich grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.\nHanks' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama\nApollo 13 (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384/?ls)\n- reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film\nToy Story (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/?ls)\n, as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy\nThat Thing You Do! (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117887/?ls)\nabout the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.\nAs of 2022, Hanks is 66-years-old.

His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother's\nheritage is half French (from Brittany) and half German. The\nyoung Stallone attended the American College of Switzerland and\nThe University of Miami, eventually obtaining a B.A. degree. Initially, he\nstruggled in small parts in films such as the soft-core\nThe Party at Kitty and Stud's (1970) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065904/?ls)\n,\nthe thriller\nKlute (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067309/?ls)\nand the comedy\nBananas (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066808/?ls)\n. He got a crucial career\nbreak alongside fellow young actor\nHenry Winkler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001857/?ls)\n, sharing lead billing in the\neffectively written teen gang film\nThe Lords of Flatbush (1974) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071772/?ls)\n.\nFurther film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring\nproductions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac,\nbloodthirsty race driver named \"Machine Gun Joe Viterbo\" in the\nRoger Corman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000339/?ls)\n-produced\nDeath Race 2000 (1975) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072856/?ls)\n. However,\nStallone was also keen to be recognized as a screenwriter, not just an\nactor, and, inspired by the 1975 Muhammad Ali-Chuck Wepner fight in\nCleveland, Stallone wrote a film script about a nobody fighter given\nthe \"million to one opportunity\" to challenge for the heavyweight\ntitle.\nRocky (1976) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/?ls)\nbecame the stuff of\ncinematic legends, scoring ten Academy Award nominations, winning the\nBest Picture Award of 1976 and triggering one of the most financially\nsuccessful movie series in history! Whilst full credit is wholly\ndeserved by Stallone, he was duly supported by tremendous acting from\nfellow cast members\nTalia Shire (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001735/?ls)\n,\nBurgess Meredith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580565/?ls)\nand\nBurt Young (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949350/?ls)\n, and director\nJohn G. Avildsen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000814/?ls)\ngave the film an\nemotive, earthy appeal from start to finish. Stallone had truly arrived\non his terms, and offers poured in from various studios eager to secure\nHollywood's hottest new star.\nStallone followed\nRocky (1976) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/?ls)\nwith\nF.I.S.T. (1978) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077531/?ls)\n, loosely based on the life\nof Teamsters boss \"Jimmy Hoffa\", and\nParadise Alley (1978) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078056/?ls)\nbefore\npulling on the boxing gloves again to resurrect Rocky Balboa in the\nsequel\nRocky II (1979) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079817/?ls)\n. The second\nouting for the \"Italian Stallion\" wasn't as powerful or successful as\nthe first \"Rocky\", however, it still produced strong box office.\nSubsequent films\nNighthawks (1981) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082817/?ls)\nand\nVictory (1981) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083284/?ls)\nfailed to ignite with\naudiences, so Stallone was once again lured back to familiar territory\nwith\nRocky III (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084602/?ls)\nand a fearsome\nopponent in \"Clubber Lang\" played by muscular ex-bodyguard\nMr. T (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001558/?ls)\n. The third \"Rocky\" installment far\noutperformed the first sequel in box office takings, but Stallone\nretired his prizefighter for a couple of years as another\nseries was about to commence for the busy actor.\nThe character of Green Beret \"John Rambo\" was the creation of\nCanadian-born writer\nDavid Morrell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0606251/?ls)\n, and his novel was\nadapted to the screen with Stallone in the lead role in\nFirst Blood (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083944/?ls)\n, also starring\nRichard Crenna (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001077/?ls)\nand\nBrian Dennehy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001133/?ls)\n. The movie was a surprise\nhit that polarized audiences because of its commentary about the\nVietnam war, which was still relatively fresh in the American public's\npsyche. Political viewpoints aside, the film was a worldwide smash, and\na sequel soon followed with\nRambo: First Blood Part II (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089880/?ls)\n,\nwhich drew even stronger criticism from several quarters owing to the\nfilm's plot line about American MIAs allegedly being held in Vietnam.\nBut they say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and \"John\nRambo's\" second adventure was a major money spinner for Stallone and\ncemented him as one of the top male stars of the 1980s. Riding a wave\nof amazing popularity, Stallone called on old sparring partner Rocky\nBalboa to climb back into the ring to defend American pride against a\nSoviet threat in the form of a towering Russian boxer named \"Ivan\nDrago\" played by curt\nDolph Lundgren (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000185/?ls)\nin\nRocky IV (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089927/?ls)\n. The fourth outing was\nsomewhat controversial with \"Rocky\" fans, as violence levels seemed\nexcessive compared to previous \"Rocky\" films, especially with the\nsavage beating suffered by Apollo Creed, played by\nCarl Weathers (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001835/?ls)\n, at the hands of the\nunstoppable \"Siberian Express\".\nStallone continued forward with a slew of macho character-themed films\nthat met with a mixed reception from his fans.\nCobra (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090859/?ls)\nwas a clumsy mess,\nOver the Top (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093692/?ls)\nwas equally\nmediocre,\nRambo III (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095956/?ls)\nsaw Rambo\ntake on the Russians in Afghanistan, and cop buddy film\nTango & Cash (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098439/?ls)\njust did not\nquite hit the mark, although it did feature a top-notch cast and there\nwas chemistry between Stallone and co-star\nKurt Russell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000621/?ls)\n.\nPhiladelphia's favorite mythical boxer moved out of the shadows for his\nfifth screen outing in\nRocky V (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100507/?ls)\ntackling Tommy \"Machine\" Gunn played by real-life heavyweight fighter\nTommy Morrison (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607338/?ls)\n, the great-nephew\nof screen legend\nJohn Wayne (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000078/?ls)\n.

Interestingly,\nStallone then took a departure from the gung-ho steely characters he\nhad been portraying to stack on a few extra pounds and tackle a more\ndramatically challenging role in the intriguing\nCop Land (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118887/?ls)\n, also starring\nRobert De Niro (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/?ls)\nand\nRay Liotta (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000501/?ls)\n.

Will Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000226/?ref_=ls_t_17)\nProducer\nActor\nWriter\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1995–1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098800/?ref_=ls_knf_17)\nWillard Carroll \"Will\" Smith II (born September 25, 1968) is an American actor, comedian, producer, rapper, and songwriter. He has enjoyed success in television, film, and music. In April 2007, Newsweek called him \"the most powerful actor in Hollywood\". Smith has been nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, two Academy Awards, and has won four Grammy Awards.\nIn the late 1980s, Smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name The Fresh Prince. In 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the popular television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show ran for six seasons (1990-96) on NBC and has been syndicated consistently on various networks since then. After the series ended, Smith moved from television to film, and ultimately starred in numerous blockbuster films. He is the only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office, eleven consecutive films gross over $150 million internationally, and eight consecutive films in which he starred open at the number one spot in the domestic box office tally.\nSmith is ranked as the most bankable star worldwide by Forbes. As of 2014, 17 of the 21 films in which he has had leading roles have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of over $100 million each, five taking in over $500 million each in global box office receipts. As of 2014, his films have grossed $6.6 billion at the global box office. He has received Best Actor Oscar nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.\nSmith was born in West Philadelphia, the son of Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith, Sr., a refrigeration engineer. He grew up in West Philadelphia's Wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised Baptist. He has three siblings, sister Pamela, who is four years older, and twins Harry and Ellen, who are three years younger. Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia. His parents separated when he was 13, but did not actually divorce until around 2000.\nSmith attended Overbrook High School. Though widely reported, it is untrue that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); he never applied to college because he \"wanted to rap.\" Smith says he was admitted to a \"pre-engineering [summer] program\" at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend. According to Smith, \"My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college.\"\nSmith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey \"DJ Jazzy Jeff\" Townes as producer, as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence Holmes) as the human beat box. The trio was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably \"Parents Just Don't Understand\" and \"Summertime\". They gained critical acclaim and won the first Grammy awarded in the Rap category (1988).\nSmith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income. Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990, when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.\nThe show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming \"the biggest movie star in the world\", studying box office successes' common characteristics.\nSmith's first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in which he starred opposite Martin Lawrence.\nIn 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich's Independence Day. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw. He later struck gold again in the summer of 1997 alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the summer hit Men in Black playing Agent J. In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.\nHe turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in favor of Wild Wild West (1999). Despite the disappointment of Wild Wild West, Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of Wild Wild West he stated that he \"made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better.\"\nIn 2005, Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.\nHe has planned to star in a feature film remake of the television series It Takes a Thief.\nOn December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the world-renowned theater in front of many fans. Later that month, Smith starred in the film I Am Legend, released December 14, 2007. Despite marginally positive reviews, its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be \"aggressively unique\". A reviewer said that the film's commercial success \"cemented [Smith's] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood.\" On December 1, 2008, TV Guide reported that Smith was selected as one of America's top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that aired on December 4, 2008.\nIn 2008 Smith was reported to be developing a film entitled The Last Pharaoh, in which he would be starring as Taharqa. It was in 2008 that Smith starred in the superhero movie Hancock.\nMen in Black III opened on May 25, 2012 with Smith again reprising his role as Agent J. This was his first major starring role in four years.\nOn August 19, 2011, it was announced that Smith had returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album. Edwards has worked with artists such as T.I., Chris Brown, and Game. Smith's most recent studio album, Lost and Found, was released in 2005.\nSmith and his son Jaden played father and son in two productions: the 2006 biographical drama The Pursuit of Happyness, and the science fiction film After Earth, which was released on May 31, 2013.\nSmith starred opposite Margot Robbie in the romance drama Focus. He played Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con artist who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. Focus was released on February 27, 2015. Smith was set to star in the Sci-Fic thriller Brilliance, an adaptation of Marcus Sakey's novel of the same name scripted by Jurassic Park writer David Koepp. But he left the project.\nSmith played Dr. Bennet Omalu of the Brain Injury Research Institute in the sports-drama Concussion, who became the first person to discover chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a football player's brain. CTE is a degenerative disease caused by severe trauma to the head that can be discovered only after death. Smith's involvement is mostly due to his last-minute exit from the Sci-Fi thriller-drama Brilliance. Concussion was directed by Peter Landesman and-bead filmed in Pittsburgh, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. It received $14.4 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania. Principal photography started on October 27, 2014. Actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw played his wife. Omalu served as a consultant.\nAs of November 2015, Smith is set to star in the independent drama Collateral Beauty, which will be directed by David Frankel. Smith will play a New York advertising executive who succumbs to an deep depression after a personal tragedy.\nNobel Peace Prize Concert December 11, 2009, in Oslo, Norway: Smith with wife Jada and children Jaden and Willow\nSmith married Sheree Zampino in 1992. They had one son, Trey Smith, born on November 11, 1992, and divorced in 1995. Trey appeared in his father's music video for the 1998 single \"Just the Two of Us\". He also acted in two episodes of the sitcom All of Us, and has appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and on the David Blaine: Real or Magic TV special.\nSmith married actress Jada Koren Pinkett in 1997. Together they have two children: Jaden Christopher Syre Smith (born 1998), his co-star in The Pursuit of Happyness and After Earth, and Willow Camille Reign Smith (born 2000), who appeared as his daughter in I Am Legend. Smith and his brother Harry own Treyball Development Inc., a Beverly Hills-based company named after Trey. Smith and his family reside in Los Angeles, California.\nSmith was consistently listed in Fortune Magazine's \"Richest 40\" list of the forty wealthiest Americans under the age of 40.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142/?ref_=ls_i_18)\n18. Clint Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142/?ref_=ls_t_18)\nActor\nProducer\nDirector\nMillion Dollar Baby (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405159/?ref_=ls_knf_18)\nClinton Eastwood Jr. was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, to Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and\nRuth Wood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2503495/?ls)\n(née Margret Ruth Runner), a housewife turned IBM clerk. He grew up in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. In 1949, the year he graduated from high school, his parents and younger sister Jeanne moved to Seattle. Clint spent a couple years in the Pacific Northwest himself, operating log broncs in Springfield, Oregon, with summer gigs life-guarding in Renton, Washington. Returning to California in 1951, he did a two-year stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at L.A. City College, but dropped out to pursue acting.\nDuring the mid-1950s he landed uncredited bit parts in such Z movies as\nRevenge of the Creature (1955) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048554/?ls)\nand\nTarantula (1955) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048696/?ls)\nwhile digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show\nRawhide (1959) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052504/?ls)\nwith\nEric Fleming (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/?ls)\n. Although only a secondary player the first seven seasons, he was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.\nEastwood's big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in\nSergio Leone (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001466/?ls)\n's trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns:\nA Fistful of Dollars (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058461/?ls)\n,\nFor a Few Dollars More (1965) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059578/?ls)\n, and\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/?ls)\n. The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with\nEnrico Maria Salerno (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0758066/?ls)\nproviding the voice of Eastwood's character, finally getting American distribution in 1967-68. As the last film racked up respectable grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from a barely registering actor to sought-after commodity in just a matter of months. Again a success was the late-blooming star's first U.S.-made western,\nHang 'Em High (1968) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061747/?ls)\n. He followed that up with the lead role in\nCoogan's Bluff (1968) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062824/?ls)\n(the loose inspiration for the TV series\nMcCloud (1970) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065317/?ls)\n), before playing second fiddle to\nRichard Burton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000009/?ls)\nin the World War II epic\nWhere Eagles Dare (1968) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065207/?ls)\nand\nLee Marvin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001511/?ls)\nin the bizarre musical\nPaint Your Wagon (1969) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064782/?ls)\n. In\nTwo Mules for Sister Sara (1970) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065134/?ls)\nand\nKelly's Heroes (1970) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065938/?ls)\n, Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.\n1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a sleazy Union soldier in\nThe Beguiled (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066819/?ls)\nto critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller\nPlay Misty for Me (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067588/?ls)\n. His role as the hard edge police inspector in\nDirty Harry (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066999/?ls)\n, meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns\nJoe Kidd (1972) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068768/?ls)\n,\nHigh Plains Drifter (1973) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068699/?ls)\nand\nThe Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075029/?ls)\n(his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love\nSondra Locke (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0516800/?ls)\n), the Dirty Harry sequels\nMagnum Force (1973) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070355/?ls)\nand\nThe Enforcer (1976) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074483/?ls)\n, the action-packed road adventures\nThunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072288/?ls)\nand\nThe Gauntlet (1977) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076070/?ls)\n, and the prison film\nEscape from Alcatraz (1979) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079116/?ls)\n. He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with\nEvery Which Way But Loose (1978) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077523/?ls)\n, which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short,\nThe Eiger Sanction (1975) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072926/?ls)\nnotwithstanding, the 1970s were nonstop success for Eastwood.\nEastwood kicked off the 1980s with\nAny Which Way You Can (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080377/?ls)\n, the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film,\nSudden Impact (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086383/?ls)\n, was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: \"Make my day.\" He also starred in\nBronco Billy (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080472/?ls)\n,\nFirefox (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083943/?ls)\n,\nTightrope (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088272/?ls)\n,\nCity Heat (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087062/?ls)\n,\nPale Rider (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089767/?ls)\nand\nHeartbreak Ridge (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091187/?ls)\n, all of which were solid hits, with\nHonkytonk Man (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084088/?ls)\nbeing his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988, he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie,\nThe Dead Pool (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094963/?ls)\n. Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like\nPink Cadillac (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098097/?ls)\nand\nThe Rookie (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100514/?ls)\n, it seemed Eastwood's star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on low-key projects, directing\nBird (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094747/?ls)\n, a biopic of\nCharlie Parker (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0662127/?ls)\nthat earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing\nWhite Hunter Black Heart (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100928/?ls)\n, an uneven, loose biopic of\nJohn Huston (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001379/?ls)\n(both films had a limited release).\nEastwood bounced back big time with his dark western\nUnforgiven (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105695/?ls)\n, which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in\nIn the Line of Fire (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ls)\n, then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received\nA Perfect World (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107808/?ls)\nwith\nKevin Costner (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000126/?ls)\n. Next was a love story,\nThe Bridges of Madison County (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112579/?ls)\n, where Eastwood surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than\nMeryl Streep (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000658/?ls)\n. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out.\nAbsolute Power (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118548/?ls)\nand\nSpace Cowboys (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186566/?ls)\ndid well enough, while\nTrue Crime (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139668/?ls)\nand\nBlood Work (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309377/?ls)\nwere received badly, as was\nMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119668/?ls)\n, which he directed but didn't appear in.\nEastwood surprised again in the mid-2000s, returning to the top of the A-list with\nMillion Dollar Baby (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405159/?ls)\n. Also starring\nHilary Swank (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005476/?ls)\nand\nMorgan Freeman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/?ls)\n, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. His next starring vehicle,\nGran Torino (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1205489/?ls)\n, earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie,\nTrouble with the Curve (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2083383/?ls)\n, as well as a reality show,\nMrs. Eastwood & Company (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2305717/?ls)\n.\nBetween acting jobs, he chalked up an impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed\nMystic River (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327056/?ls)\n(in which\nSean Penn (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000576/?ls)\nand\nTim Robbins (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000209/?ls)\ngave Oscar-winning performances),\nFlags of Our Fathers (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418689/?ls)\n,\nLetters from Iwo Jima (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0498380/?ls)\n(nominated for the Best Picture Oscar),\nChangeling (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824747/?ls)\n(a vehicle for\nAngelina Jolie (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001401/?ls)\n),\nInvictus (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1057500/?ls)\n(again with Freeman),\nHereafter (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1212419/?ls)\n,\nJ.

Back on screens after a considerable absence, he played an unlikely drug courier in\nThe Mule (2018) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7959026/?ls)\n, which reached the top of the box office with a nine-figure gross, then directed\nRichard Jewell (2019) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3513548/?ls)\n. At age 91, Eastwood made history as the oldest actor to star above the title in a movie with the release of\nCry Macho (2021) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924245/?ls)\n.\nAway from the limelight, Eastwood has led an aberrant existence and is described by biographer\nPatrick McGilligan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0569292/?ls)\nas a cunning manipulator of the media. His convoluted slew of partners and children are now somewhat factually acknowledged, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The actor refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day. He had a longtime relationship with similarly abstruse co-star Locke (who died aged 74 in 2018, though for her entire public life she masqueraded about being younger), and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however, with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.\nHis known children are:\nLaurie Murray (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm15158933/?ls)\n(b. 1954), whose mother is unidentified;\nKimber Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0247761/?ls)\n(b. 1964) with stuntwoman\nRoxanne Tunis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876651/?ls)\n;\nKyle Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0247762/?ls)\n(b. 1968) and\nAlison Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002055/?ls)\n(b. 1972) with his first ex-wife,\nMargaret Neville Johnson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1527881/?ls)\n;\nScott Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2207222/?ls)\n(b. 1986) and\nKathryn Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1828228/?ls)\n(b. 1988) with stewardess Jacelyn Reeves;\nFrancesca Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0247754/?ls)\n(b. 1993) with actress\nFrances Fisher (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004920/?ls)\n; and\nMorgan Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1765859/?ls)\n(b. 1996) with his second ex-wife,\nDina Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0247753/?ls)\n.

Collaborating once again with\nSteven Soderbergh (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001752/?ls)\n, Ocean's Eleven (2001) received critical acclaim, earned more than $450 million at the box office, and spawned two sequels:\nOcean's Twelve (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349903/?ls)\nand\nOcean's Thirteen (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496806/?ls)\n.\nIn 2002, Clooney made his directorial debut with\nConfessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0270288/?ls)\n, an adaptation of TV producer\nChuck Barris (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0057567/?ls)\n' autobiography.

He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with\nJaws (1975) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/?ls)\n, and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.\nSteven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and\nArnold Spielberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0818577/?ls)\n, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped\nout to pursue his entertainment career.\nAmong his\nearly directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World\nWar II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes\nyou believe is moving. He also directed\nEscape to Nowhere (1961) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054857/?ls)\n, which\nfeatured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister\nAnne Spielberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0818576/?ls)\n, and\nThe Last Gun (1959) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052991/?ls)\n, a western.\nAll of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg\ndirected a couple of movies that would portend his future career in\nmovies. In 1964, he directed\nFirelight (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059181/?ls)\n, a movie about aliens\ninvading a small town. In 1967, he directed\nSlipstream (1967) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249968/?ls)\n, which was\nunfinished. However, in 1968, he directed\nAmblin' (1968) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064010/?ls)\n, which featured the desert\nprominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would\nfeature. Amblin' also became the name of his production\ncompany, which turned out such classics as\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/?ls)\n.\nSpielberg had a unique and classic early directing project,\nDuel (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067023/?ls)\n, with\nDennis Weaver (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915840/?ls)\n. In the early 1970s,\nSpielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as\nRod Serling (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0785245/?ls)\n's\nNight Gallery (1969) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065327/?ls)\n,\nMarcus Welby, M.D. (1969) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063927/?ls)\nand\nMurder by the Book (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066932/?ls)\n.\nAll of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing\nprojects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would\ndazzle audiences all over the world.\nSpielberg's first major directorial effort was\nThe Sugarland Express (1974) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072226/?ls)\n,\nwith\nGoldie Hawn (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000443/?ls)\n, a film that marked him as\na rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an\ninternational superstar among directors:\nJaws (1975) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/?ls)\n. This classic shark attack tale\nstarted the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was\ncredited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075860/?ls)\n,\na unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978,\nSpielberg produced his first film, the forgettable\nI Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077714/?ls)\n,\nand followed that effort with\nUsed Cars (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081698/?ls)\n, a critically\nacclaimed, but mostly forgotten,\nKurt Russell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000621/?ls)\n/\nJack Warden (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912001/?ls)\ncomedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more\ntime with\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/?ls)\n,\nwith\nHarrison Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/?ls)\ntaking the part\nof Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982.\nThe first was\nPoltergeist (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084516/?ls)\n, but\nthe highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien\nstory\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/?ls)\n.\nSpielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The\nconcept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when\nSpielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or\ninfamous) placement of Reese's Pieces in \"E.T.\" Spielberg was also one\nof the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like \"E.T.\"\nand \"Close Encounters\", where a very strong emphasis on special effects\nwas placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg\nfollowed up \"Raiders\" with\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087469/?ls)\n,\nwhich was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim\nof its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in\nthe 1980s, such as\nThe Goonies (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089218/?ls)\n, and was the\nbrains behind the little monsters in\nGremlins (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/?ls)\n. He also produced the\ncartoon\nAn American Tail (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090633/?ls)\n, a\nquaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985,\nhowever, was the blockbuster\nBack to the Future (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/?ls)\n,\nwhich made\nMichael J. Fox (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000150/?ls)\nan\ninstant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book\nThe Color Purple (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088939/?ls)\n, with\nWhoopi Goldberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000155/?ls)\nand\nOprah Winfrey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001856/?ls)\n, with great success. In the\nlatter half of the 1980s, he also directed\nEmpire of the Sun (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092965/?ls)\n, a\nmixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not\nescape him for long, though.\nThe late 1980s found Spielberg's projects at the center of pop-culture\nyet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096438/?ls)\n.\nThe next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he\nproduced and directed\nAlways (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096794/?ls)\nas\nwell as\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097576/?ls)\n,\nand\nBack to the Future Part II (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874/?ls)\n.\nAll three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in\n1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama\nDad (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097142/?ls)\n, with\nJack Lemmon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000493/?ls)\nand\nTed Danson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001101/?ls)\n, which got mostly mixed results.\nSpielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong\nvoice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark \"Who\nFramed Roger Rabbit\", he produced the animated series\nTiny Toon Adventures (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098929/?ls)\n,\nAnimaniacs (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105941/?ls)\n,\nPinky and the Brain (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112123/?ls)\n,\nFreakazoid!

Spielberg\nalso produced other cartoons such as\nThe Land Before Time (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095489/?ls)\n,\nWe're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108526/?ls)\n,\nCasper (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112642/?ls)\n(the live action version) as\nwell as the live-action version of\nThe Flintstones (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109813/?ls)\n, where\nhe was credited as \"Steven Spielrock\". Spielberg also produced many\nRoger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs\nand Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s,\nas he directed\nHook (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102057/?ls)\nand produced such\nfilms as the cute fantasy\nJoe Versus the Volcano (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099892/?ls)\nand\nAn American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101329/?ls)\n.\nHe also produced the unusual comedy thriller\nArachnophobia (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099052/?ls)\n,\nBack to the Future Part III (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099088/?ls)\nand\nGremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099700/?ls)\n.\nWhile these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not\nquite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous\nefforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed\nJurassic Park (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/?ls)\n, which for a\nshort time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time,\nbut did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big\nbox-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced\nand directed\nSchindler's List (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108052/?ls)\n, a\nstirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars,\nand also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the\nproduction company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many\nbox-office successes.\nAs a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such\nfilms as\nThe Mask of Zorro (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120746/?ls)\n,\nMen in Black (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/?ls)\nand\nDeep Impact (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120647/?ls)\n. However, it was\non the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and\nproduced the epic\nAmistad (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118607/?ls)\n, a\nspectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to\nthe fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997.\nThe next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best\nfilms of his career:\nSaving Private Ryan (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/?ls)\n, a\nfilm about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect.\nIt was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to\nShakespeare in Love (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138097/?ls)\n.\nSpielberg produced a series of films, including\nEvolution (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251075/?ls)\n,\nThe Haunting (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171363/?ls)\nand\nShrek (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/?ls)\n. he also produced two sequels\nto\nJurassic Park (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/?ls)\n, which were\nfinancially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he\nproduced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a\nfinancial and critical success:\nBand of Brothers (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/?ls)\n, a\ntale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the\ninvasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was\nback in the director's chair for\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212720/?ls)\n,\na movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box\noffice and garnered varied reviews from critics.\nSpielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other\nthings he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series\nSeaQuest 2032 (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106126/?ls)\n, an\nanthology series entitled\nAmazing Stories (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088478/?ls)\n,\ncreated the video-game series \"Medal of Honor\" set during World War\nTwo, and was a starting producer of\nER (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108757/?ls)\n. Spielberg, if you haven't\nnoticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and\nTom Hanks (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158/?ls)\ncollaborated on\nShooting War: World War II Combat Cameramen (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250730/?ls)\n, a\ndocumentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a\ndocumentary about the Holocaust called\nEyes of the Holocaust (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262468/?ls)\n.\nWith all of this to Spielberg's credit, it's no wonder that he's looked\nat as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/?ref_=ls_i_22)\n22.

Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in\nStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/?ls)\n. Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/?ls)\n.\nFour years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in\nWitness (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090329/?ls)\n. All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in\nPatriot Games (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105112/?ls)\n. Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in\nThe Fugitive (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106977/?ls)\n. He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\nFord is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope.\nOn March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had suffered engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/?ref_=ls_i_23)\n23.

Al Pacino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/?ref_=ls_t_24)\nActor\nDirector\nProducer\nSerpico (1973) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070666/?ref_=ls_knf_24)\nAlfredo James \"Al\" 'Pacino established himself as a film actor during one of cinema's most vibrant decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies.\nHe was born April 25, 1940 in Manhattan, New York City, to Italian-American parents, Rose (nee Gerardi) and\nSal Pacino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0655416/?ls)\n. They divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents' home in the South Bronx. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies. Bored and unmotivated in school, he found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting onstage, he went through a period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under\nLee Strasberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833448/?ls)\n, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.\nAfter appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally attained success off-Broadway with\nIsrael Horovitz (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0395262/?ls)\n's \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\", winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for \"Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?\" His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in\nThe Panic in Needle Park (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067549/?ls)\nafter his film debut in\nMe, Natalie (1969) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064651/?ls)\n. The role of Michael Corleone in\nThe Godfather (1972) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/?ls)\nwas one of the most sought-after of the time:\nRobert Redford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000602/?ls)\n,\nWarren Beatty (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000886/?ls)\n,\nJack Nicholson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/?ls)\n,\nRyan O'Neal (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641939/?ls)\n,\nRobert De Niro (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/?ls)\nand a host of other actors either wanted it or were mentioned, but director\nFrancis Ford Coppola (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000338/?ls)\nwanted Pacino for the role.\nCoppola was successful but Pacino was reportedly in constant fear of being fired during the very difficult shoot. The film was a monster hit that earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama\nSerpico (1973) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070666/?ls)\nand the tragic real-life bank robbery film\nDog Day Afternoon (1975) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072890/?ls)\n. He was nominated three consecutive years for the \"Best Actor\" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with\nBobby Deerfield (1977) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075774/?ls)\n, but regained his stride with\nAnd Justice for All (1979) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078718/?ls)\n, for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced flops like\nCruising (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080569/?ls)\nand\nAuthor! Author! (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083598/?ls)\n.\nPacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film\nScarface (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/?ls)\n, but a monumental mistake was about to follow.\nRevolution (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089913/?ls)\nendured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino fell ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script further derailed the project. The Revolutionary War-themed film, considered among the worst films ever made, resulted in awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino did much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film,\nThe Local Stigmatic (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097769/?ls)\n, but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking\nSea of Love (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098273/?ls)\nas a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.\nReturning to the Corleones, Pacino made\nThe Godfather Part III (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674/?ls)\nand earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation\nDick Tracy (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099422/?ls)\n. This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for\nGlengarry Glen Ross (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/?ls)\n. He went into romantic mode for\nFrankie and Johnny (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101912/?ls)\n. In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in\nScent of a Woman (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105323/?ls)\n. A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic.\nThe next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days.\nCarlito's Way (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106519/?ls)\nproved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama\nHeat (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ls)\ndirected by\nMichael Mann (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000520/?ls)\nand co-starring\nRobert De Niro (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/?ls)\n. He directed the film adaptation of Shakespeare's\nLooking for Richard (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116913/?ls)\n. During this period,\nCity Hall (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115907/?ls)\n,\nDonnie Brasco (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119008/?ls)\nand\nThe Devil's Advocate (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971/?ls)\nall came out. Reteaming with Mann and then\nOliver Stone (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000231/?ls)\n, he gave commanding performances in\nThe Insider (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140352/?ls)\nand\nAny Given Sunday (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146838/?ls)\n.\nIn the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including\nOcean's Thirteen (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496806/?ls)\n, but his choice in television roles (the vicious, closeted Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries\nAngels in America (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318997/?ls)\nand his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie\nYou Don't Know Jack (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132623/?ls)\n) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.\nNever wed, Pacino has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a set of twins with former longtime girlfriend\nBeverly D'Angelo (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000350/?ls)\n.

The British actress has made a point of eschewing straightforward pretty-girl parts in favor of more devilish damsels; as a result, she's built an eclectic resume that runs the gamut from Shakespearean tragedy to modern-day mysticism and erotica.\nKate Elizabeth Winslet was born in Reading, Berkshire, into a family of thespians -- parents\nRoger Winslet (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935474/?ls)\nand Sally Anne Bridges-Winslet were both stage actors, maternal grandparents Oliver and Linda Bridges ran the Reading Repertory Theatre, and uncle\nRobert Bridges (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0108788/?ls)\nwas a fixture in London's West End theatre district. Kate came into her talent at an early age. She scored her first professional gig at eleven, dancing opposite the Honey Monster in a commercial for a kids' cereal. She started acting lessons around the same time, which led to formal training at a performing arts high school. Over the next few years, she appeared on stage regularly and landed a few bit parts in sitcoms. Her first big break came at age 17, when she was cast as an obsessive adolescent in\nHeavenly Creatures (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110005/?ls)\n. The film, based on the true story of two fantasy-gripped girls who commit a brutal murder, received modest distribution but was roundly praised by critics.\nStill a relative unknown, Winslet attended a cattle call audition the next year for\nAng Lee (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000487/?ls)\n's\nSense and Sensibility (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114388/?ls)\n. She made an immediate impression on the film's star,\nEmma Thompson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000668/?ls)\n, and beat out more than a hundred other hopefuls for the part of plucky Marianne Dashwood. Her efforts were rewarded with both a British Academy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Winslet followed up with two more period pieces, playing the rebellious heroine in\nJude (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116722/?ls)\nand Ophelia in\nKenneth Branagh (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000110/?ls)\n's\nHamlet (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116477/?ls)\n.\nThe role that transformed Winslet from art house attraction to international star was Rose DeWitt Bukater, the passionate, rosy-cheeked aristocrat in\nJames Cameron (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000116/?ls)\n's\nTitanic (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/?ls)\n. Young girls the world over both idolized and identified with Winslet, swooning over all that face time opposite heartthrob\nLeonardo DiCaprio (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/?ls)\nand noting her refreshingly healthy, unemaciated physique. Winslet's performance also garnered a Best Actress nomination, making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy Award nominations.\nAfter the swell of unexpected attention surrounding\nTitanic (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/?ls)\n, Winslet was eager to retreat into independent projects. Rumor has it that she turned down the lead roles in both\nShakespeare in Love (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138097/?ls)\nand\nAnna and the King (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166485/?ls)\nin order to play adventurous soul searchers in\nHideous Kinky (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0136244/?ls)\nand\nHoly Smoke (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144715/?ls)\n. The former cast her as a young single mother traveling through 1970s Morocco with her daughters in tow; the latter, as a zealous follower of a guru tricked into a \"deprogramming\" session in the Australian outback. The next year found her back in period dress as the Marquis de Sade's chambermaid and accomplice in\nQuills (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180073/?ls)\n. Kate holds the distinction of being the youngest actor ever honored with four Academy Award nominations (she received her fourth at age 29). As of 2016, she has been nominated for an Oscar seven times, winning one of them: she received the Best Actress Oscar for the drama\nThe Reader (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0976051/?ls)\n, playing a former concentration camp guard.\nFor her performance of Joanna Hoffman in\nSteve Jobs (2015) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2080374/?ls)\n, she received her seventh Academy Award nomination.\nOff camera, Winslet is known for her mischievous pranks and familial devotion. She has two sisters,\nAnna Winslet (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935472/?ls)\nand\nBeth Winslet (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935473/?ls)\n(both actresses), and a brother, Joss.\nIn 1998, she married assistant director\nJim Threapleton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0861909/?ls)\n. They had a daughter, Mia Honey Threapleton, in October 2000. They divorced in 2001. She later married director\nSam Mendes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005222/?ls)\nin 2003 and gave birth to their son, Joe Alfie Winslet-Mendes, later that year. After seven years of marriage, in February 2010 they announced that they had amicably separated, and divorced in October 2010. In 2012, Kate married Ned Rocknroll, with whom she has a son. She was awarded Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the 2012 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her services to Drama.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125/?ref_=ls_i_28)\n28.

Some believed that such a career-defining role might leave him unable to escape it, but he proved the doubters wrong, becoming one of the most notable film actors of his generation, with a host of great movies to his name. This arguably culminated in his greatest acclaim in 1988, when Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an Irish cop in\nThe Untouchables (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094226/?ls)\n, stealing the thunder from the movie's principal star\nKevin Costner (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000126/?ls)\n. Connery was polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure.\" In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man of the Century.\"\nThomas \"Sean\" Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh. His mother, Euphemia Maclean, was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He also had a brother,\nNeil Connery (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175227/?ls)\n, a plasterer in Edinburgh, who was eight years younger. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional soccer player or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent decisions.\nNo Road Back (1957) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050772/?ls)\nwas Sean's first major movie role, and it was followed by several made-for-TV movies such as\nAnna Christie (1957) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313207/?ls)\n,\nMacbeth (1961) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0400618/?ls)\nand\nAnna Karenina (1961) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267267/?ls)\nas well as guest appearances on TV series, and also films such as\nHell Drivers (1957) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051713/?ls)\n,\nAnother Time, Another Place (1958) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051364/?ls)\n,\nDarby O'Gill and the Little People (1959) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052722/?ls)\nand\nThe Frightened City (1961) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054898/?ls)\n. In 1962 he appeared in\nThe Longest Day (1962) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056197/?ls)\nwith a host of other stars.\nHis big breakthrough came in 1962 when he landed the role of secret agent James Bond in\nDr. No (1962) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055928/?ls)\n. He played James Bond in six more films:\nFrom Russia with Love (1963) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057076/?ls)\n,\nGoldfinger (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058150/?ls)\n,\nThunderball (1965) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059800/?ls)\n,\nYou Only Live Twice (1967) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062512/?ls)\n,\nDiamonds Are Forever (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066995/?ls)\nand\nNever Say Never Again (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086006/?ls)\n.\nAfter and during the success of the Bond films, he maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including\nAlfred Hitchcock (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000033/?ls)\n's\nMarnie (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058329/?ls)\n,\nThe Hill (1965) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059274/?ls)\n,\nMurder on the Orient Express (1974) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071877/?ls)\n,\nThe Man Who Would Be King (1975) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073341/?ls)\n,\nThe Wind and the Lion (1975) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073906/?ls)\n,\nTime Bandits (1981) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081633/?ls)\n,\nHighlander (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091203/?ls)\n,\nThe Name of the Rose (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091605/?ls)\n,\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097576/?ls)\n,\nThe Hunt for Red October (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099810/?ls)\n,\nRising Sun (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107969/?ls)\n,\nThe Rock (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/?ls)\n,\nFinding Forrester (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181536/?ls)\nand\nThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311429/?ls)\n.\nSean married actress\nDiane Cilento (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0162283/?ls)\nin 1962 and they had Sean's only child,\nJason Connery (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001064/?ls)\n, born on January 11, 1963.

Mark Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000242/?ref_=ls_t_29)\nProducer\nActor\nComposer\nThe Fighter (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964517/?ref_=ls_knf_29)\nAmerican actor Mark Wahlberg is one of a handful of respected entertainers who successfully made the transition from teen pop idol to acclaimed actor. A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for\nThe Departed (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/?ls)\nwho went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in\nThe Fighter (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964517/?ls)\n, Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in\nTed (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637725/?ls)\n.\nMark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), French-Canadian, English, Irish and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn't have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark's mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son's subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He'd spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.\nThe young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.\nAround this time, his older brother\nDonnie Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005531/?ls)\nhad become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band\nNew Kids on the Block (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578753/?ls)\n. A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.\nDonnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his \"Funky Bunch\" and \"Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch\" was born. His debut album, \"Music for the People\", was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper's willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping \"bad boy\". Record producer\nDavid Geffen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311691/?ls)\nsaw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer\nCalvin Klein (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0458681/?ls)\n, Marky Mark was set up as the designer's chief underwear model.\nHis scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the\nNew Kids on the Block (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578753/?ls)\n's fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, \"Marky Mark's\" bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with\nMadonna (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000187/?ls)\nand her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper\nShabba Ranks (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1133072/?ls)\n, he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, \"You Gotta Believe\", had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.\nAdding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the \"Marky Mark\" moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in\nPenny Marshall (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001508/?ls)\n's\nRenaissance Man (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110971/?ls)\n. Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In\nRenaissance Man (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110971/?ls)\n, he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial\nThe Basketball Diaries (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112461/?ls)\nand chilled them in\nFear (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116287/?ls)\nas every father's worst nightmare.\nThe major turning point in Wahlberg's career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in\nPaul Thomas Anderson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000759/?ls)\n's\nBoogie Nights (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/?ls)\n. Since then, Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability, starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as\nThree Kings (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120188/?ls)\nand\nThe Perfect Storm (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177971/?ls)\n, popcorn flicks like\nPlanet of the Apes (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133152/?ls)\nand\nContraband (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1524137/?ls)\n, and even indies such as\nI Heart Huckabees (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/?ls)\n.\nWahlberg was the executive producer of such television series as\nBoardwalk Empire (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979432/?ls)\n,\nIn Treatment (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0835434/?ls)\nand the highly successful comedy\nEntourage (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387199/?ls)\n, which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood.\nWahlberg and his wife\nRhea Durham (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1081113/?ls)\nhave four children.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000204/?ref_=ls_i_30)\n30.

In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.\nAfter a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the\nRob Lowe (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000507/?ls)\nhockey flick\nYoungblood (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092272/?ls)\n, which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama,\nRiver's Edge (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860/?ls)\n, and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated\nDangerous Liaisons (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/?ls)\nwith director\nStephen Frears (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001241/?ls)\n.\nHis first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted \"Theodore\" Logan in\nBill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096928/?ls)\n. The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of\nRon Howard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/?ls)\n's comedy,\nParenthood (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098067/?ls)\nand\nLawrence Kasdan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001410/?ls)\n's\nI Love You to Death (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099819/?ls)\n.\nOver the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite\nRiver Phoenix (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000203/?ls)\n's narcoleptic male hustler in\nMy Own Private Idaho (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102494/?ls)\n, an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire's lair in\nDracula (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103874/?ls)\n, and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in\nMuch Ado About Nothing (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107616/?ls)\n.\nIn 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of\nSpeed (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/?ls)\n. Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like\nFeeling Minnesota (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116289/?ls)\nand\nThe Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119502/?ls)\n, and big films like\nA Walk in the Clouds (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114887/?ls)\nand\nThe Devil's Advocate (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971/?ls)\n. (There were a couple misfires, too:\nJohnny Mnemonic (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/?ls)\nand\nChain Reaction (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115857/?ls)\n.) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings' cyberadventure,\nThe Matrix (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/?ls)\n.\nNow a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them\nThe Replacements (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191397/?ls)\n,\nThe Watcher (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0204626/?ls)\n,\nThe Gift (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219699/?ls)\n,\nSweet November (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230838/?ls)\n, and\nHardball (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180734/?ls)\n- before\nThe Matrix Reloaded (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/?ls)\nand\nThe Matrix Revolutions (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/?ls)\nwere both released in 2003.\nSince the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with\nSomething's Gotta Give (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337741/?ls)\n,\nThe Lake House (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410297/?ls)\n, and\nStreet Kings (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421073/?ls)\n. He's kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as\nConstantine (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/?ls)\n,\nA Scanner Darkly (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/?ls)\n, and\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970416/?ls)\n. And he's waded back into art-house territory with\nEllie Parker (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436262/?ls)\n,\nThumbsucker (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318761/?ls)\n,\nThe Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1134629/?ls)\n, and\nHenry's Crime (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220888/?ls)\n.\nMost recently, as post-production on the samurai epic\n47 Ronin (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1335975/?ls)\nwaged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in\nSide by Side (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2014338/?ls)\n, a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project,\nMan of Tai Chi (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2016940/?ls)\n.\nIn 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film\nJohn Wick (2014) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2911666/?ls)\n, which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in\nJohn Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4425200/?ls)\n, taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089217/?ref_=ls_i_33)\n33.

His mother, Sonia Constance Josephine Bloom (née Copeland),\nwas born in Kolkata, India, to an English family then-resident there.\nThe man he first knew as his father, Harry Bloom, was a legendary\npolitical activist who fought for civil rights in South Africa. But\nHarry died of a stroke when Orlando was only four years old. After\nthat, Orlando and his older sister,\nSamantha Bloom (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1043808/?ls)\n, were raised by their\nmother and family friend, Colin Stone. When Orlando was 13, Sonia\nrevealed to him that Colin is actually the biological father of Orlando and his sister; the two were conceived after an agreement by his parents, since Harry, who suffered a stroke in 1975, was unable to have children.\nOrlando attended St. Edmund's School in Canterbury but struggled in many\ncourses because of dyslexia. He did embrace the arts, however, and\nenjoyed pottery, photography and sculpturing. He also participated in\nschool plays and was active at his local theater.

While growing up, Dwayne traveled around a lot with his parents and watched his father perform in the ring. During his high school years, Dwayne began playing football and he soon received a full scholarship from the University of Miami, where he had tremendous success as a football player. In 1995, Dwayne suffered a back injury which cost him a place in the NFL. He then signed a three-year deal with the Canadian League but left after a year to pursue a career in wrestling.\nHe made his wrestling debut in the USWA under the name Flex Kavanah where he won the tag team championship with Brett Sawyer. In 1996, Dwayne joined the WWE and became Rocky Maivia where he joined a group known as \"The Nation of Domination\" and turned heel. Rocky eventually took over leadership of the \"Nation\" and began taking the persona of The Rock. After the \"Nation\" split, The Rock joined another elite group of wrestlers known as the \"Corporation\" and began a memorable feud with\nSteve Austin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0042524/?ls)\n. Soon the Rock was kicked out of the \"Corporation\". He turned face and became known as \"The Peoples Champion\".

(1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127357/?ref_=ls_knf_35)\nHong Kong's cheeky, lovable and best-known film star, Jackie Chan endured many years of long, hard work and multiple injuries to establish international success after his start in Hong Kong's manic martial arts cinema industry.\nJackie was born Kong-sang Chan on April 7, 1954, on Hong Kong's famous Victoria Peak, to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, and the family immigrated to Canberra, Australia, in early 1960. The young Jackie was less than successful scholastically, so his father sent him back to Hong Kong to attend the rigorous China Drama Academy, one of the Peking Opera schools. Chan excelled at acrobatics, singing and martial arts and eventually became a member of the \"Seven Little Fortunes\" performing troupe and began lifelong friendships with fellow martial artists / actors\nSammo Kam-Bo Hung (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005033/?ls)\nand\nBiao Yuen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0950707/?ls)\n. Chan journeyed back and forth to visit his parents and work in Canberra, but eventually he made his way back to Hong Kong as his permanent home. In the early 1970s, Chan commenced his movie career and interestingly appeared in very minor roles in two films starring then rising martial arts superstar\nBruce Lee (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000045/?ls)\n:\nFist of Fury (1972) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068767/?ls)\n(aka \"The Chinese Connection\"), and the Warner Bros. production\nEnter the Dragon (1973) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070034/?ls)\n. Not long after Lee's untimely death, Chan was often cast in films cashing in on the success of Bruce Lee by utilizing words like \"fist\", \"fury\" or \"dragon\" in their US release titles.\nChan's own film career was off and running and he swiftly appeared in many low-budget martial arts films that were churned out at a rapid-fire pace by Hong Kong studios eager to satisfy the early 1970s boom in martial-arts cinema. He starred in\nShaolin Wooden Men (1976) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075201/?ls)\n,\nTo Kill with Intrigue (1977) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076227/?ls)\n,\nHalf a Loaf of Kung Fu (1978) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080623/?ls)\nand\nMagnificent Bodyguards (1978) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077541/?ls)\n, which all fared reasonably well at the cinemas. However, he scored a major breakthrough with the action comedy\nDrunken Master (1978) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080179/?ls)\n, which has become a cult favorite among martial arts film fans. Not too long after this, Chan made his directorial debut with\nThe Young Master (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081499/?ls)\nand then \"Enter the Dragon\" producer\nRobert Clouse (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0167195/?ls)\nlured Jackie to the United States for a film planned to break Jackie into the lucrative US market.\nBattle Creek Brawl (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080436/?ls)\nfeatured Jackie competing in a \"toughest Street fighter\" contest set in 1940s Texas; however, Jackie was unhappy with the end result, and it failed to fire with US audiences. In a further attempt to get his name known in the United States, Jackie was cast alongside\nBurt Reynolds (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000608/?ls)\n, Sir\nRoger Moore (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000549/?ls)\nand\nDean Martin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001509/?ls)\nin the\nHal Needham (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0624102/?ls)\n-directed car chase film\nThe Cannonball Run (1981) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082136/?ls)\n. Regrettably, Jackie was cast as a Japanese race driver and his martial arts skills are only shown in one small sequence near the film's conclusion. Stateside success was still a few years away for Jackie Chan!\nUndeterred, he returned to East Asia to do what he did best--make jaw-dropping action films loaded with amazing stunt work. Chan and his legendary stunt team were without parallel in their ability to execute the most incredible fight scenes and action sequences, and the next decade would see some of their best work. Chan paired with the dynamic Sammo Kam-Bo Hung to star in\nWinners & Sinners (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086605/?ls)\n,\nProject A (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085127/?ls)\n,\nWheels on Meals (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087578/?ls)\n,\nMy Lucky Stars (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089177/?ls)\n(aka \"Winners & Sinners 2\"),\nTwinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090342/?ls)\n(aka \"Winners & Sinners 3\"). Chan then journeyed back to the United States for another shot at that market, starring alongside\nDanny Aiello (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000732/?ls)\nin\nThe Protector (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089847/?ls)\n, filmed in Hong Kong and New York. However, as with previous attempts, Jackie felt the US director--in this case,\nJames Glickenhaus (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322785/?ls)\n--failed to understand his audience appeal and the film played to lukewarm reviews and box-office receipts. However, Jackie did decide to \"harden\" up his on-screen image somewhat and his next film,\nPolice Story (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089374/?ls)\nwas a definite departure from previously light-hearted martial arts fare, and his fans loved the final product!\nThis was quickly followed up with the\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/?ls)\n-influenced\nArmour of God (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091431/?ls)\n, during filming of which Jackie mistimed a leap from a wall to a tree on location in Yugoslavia and fell many quite a few feet onto his head, causing a skull fracture. It was another in a long line of injuries that Chan has suffered as a result of doing his own stunt work, and he was soon back in front of the cameras.\nProject A 2 (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092501/?ls)\n,\nPolice Story 2 (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095403/?ls)\n,\nMiracles: The Canton Godfather (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098019/?ls)\n(aka \"Mr. Canton and Lady Rose)\",\nArmour of God 2: Operation Condor (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099558/?ls)\n(aka \"Armour of God 2\") and\nSupercop (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104558/?ls)\n(aka \"Police Story 3\") were all sizable hits for Jackie, escalating his status to phenomenal heights in Asia, and to his loyal fanbase around the globe. US success was now just around the corner for the hard-working Jackie Chan, and it arrived in the form of the action film\nRumble in the Bronx (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113326/?ls)\n(though it was actually filmed in Canada) that successfully blended humor and action to make a winning formula in US theaters.\nJackie did not waste any time and went to work on\nFirst Strike (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116704/?ls)\n(aka \"Police Story 4\"),\nMr. Nice Guy (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117786/?ls)\n,\nWho Am I? (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127357/?ls)\n, which all met with positive results at the international box office. Jackie then went to work in his biggest-budget US production, starring alongside fast-talking comedian\nChris Tucker (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000676/?ls)\nin the action comedy\nRush Hour (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120812/?ls)\n. The film was a bigger hit than \"Rumble in the Bronx\" and firmly established Jackie as a bona fide star in the United States. Jackie then paired up with rising talent\nOwen Wilson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005562/?ls)\nto star in\nShanghai Noon (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184894/?ls)\nand its sequel,\nShanghai Knights (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300471/?ls)\n, and re-teamed with Tucker in\nRush Hour 2 (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266915/?ls)\n, as well as starring in\nThe Tuxedo (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290095/?ls)\n,\nThe Medallion (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0288045/?ls)\nand the delightful\nAround the World in 80 Days (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327437/?ls)\n. Not one to forget his loyal fanbase, Jackie returned to more gritty and traditional fare with\nNew Police Story (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386005/?ls)\nand\nThe Myth (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365847/?ls)\n. The multi-talented Chan (he is also a major recording star in Asia) shows no sign of slowing down and has long since moved out of the shadow of Bruce Lee, to whom he was usually compared early in his career.\nChan is truly one of the international film industry's true maverick actor / director / stuntman / producer combinations - he has done this the hard way, and always his way to achieve his dreams and goals to be an international cinematic star. Off screen, he has been directly involved in many philanthropic ventures providing financial assistance to schools and universities around the world. He is a UNICEF GoodWill Ambassador, and he has campaigned against animal abuse and pollution and assisted with disaster relief efforts to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami victims.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001401/?ref_=ls_i_36)\n36.

Jolie's role was reminiscent of\nJack Nicholson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/?ls)\n's character in\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073486/?ls)\n, the role which won Nicholson his first Oscar. Unlike \"Cuckoo,\" \"Girl\" was a small film that received mixed reviews and barely made money at the box office. But when it came time to give out awards, Jolie won the triple crown -- \"Girl\" propelled her to win the Golden Globe Award, the SAG Award and the Academy Award for best leading actress in a supporting role.\nWith her newfound prominence, Jolie began to get in-depth attention from the press. Numerous aspects of her controversial personal life became news. At her wedding to her\nHackers (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/?ls)\nco-star\nJonny Lee Miller (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001538/?ls)\n, she had displayed her husband's name on the back of her shirt painted in her own blood. Jolie and Miller divorced, and in 2000, she married her\nPushing Tin (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120797/?ls)\nco-star\nBilly Bob Thornton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000671/?ls)\n. Jolie had become the fifth wife of a man twenty years her senior. During her marriage to Thornton, the spouses each wore a vial of the other's blood around their necks. That marriage came apart in 2002 and ended in divorce. In addition, Jolie was estranged from her famous father,\nJon Voight (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000685/?ls)\n.\nIn 2000, Jolie was asked to star in\nLara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146316/?ls)\n. At first, she expressed disinterest, but then decided that the required training for the athletic role was intriguing. The eponymous character was drawn from a popular video game. Lara Croft was a female cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond. When the movie was released, critics were unimpressed with the final product, but critical acclaim wasn't the point of the movie. The public paid $275 million for theater tickets to see a buffed up Jolie portray the adventuresome Lara Croft. Jolie's father\nJon Voight (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000685/?ls)\nappeared in the movie, and during filming there was a brief rapprochement between father and daughter.\nOne of the Lara Croft movie's filming locations was Cambodia. While there, Jolie witnessed the natural beauty, culture and poverty of that country. She considered this an eye opening experience, and so began the humanitarian chapter of her life. Jolie began visiting refugee camps around the world and came to be formally appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Some of her experiences were written and published in her popular book \"Notes from My Travels\" whose profits go to UNHCR.\nJolie has stated that she now plans to spend most of her time in humanitarian efforts, to be financed by her actress salary. She devotes one third of her income to savings, one third to living expenses and one third to charity. In 2002, Angelina adopted a Cambodian refugee boy named Maddox, and in 2005, adopted an Ethiopian refugee girl named Zahara. Jolie's dramatic feature film\nBeyond Borders (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0294357/?ls)\nparallels some of her real life humanitarian experiences although, despite the inclusion of a romance between two westerners, many of the movie's images were too depressingly realistic -- the movie was not popular among critics or at the box office.\nIn 2004, Jolie began filming\nMr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356910/?ls)\nwith co-star\nBrad Pitt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/?ls)\n. The movie became a major box office success. There were rumors that Pitt and Jolie had an affair while filming Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Jolie insisted that because her mother had been hurt by adultery, she herself could never participate in an affair with a married man, therefore there had been no affair with Pitt at that time. Nonetheless, Pitt separated from his wife\nJennifer Aniston (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000098/?ls)\nin January 2005 and, in the months that followed, he was frequently seen in public with Jolie, apparently as a couple. Pitt's divorce was finalized later in 2005.\nJolie and Pitt announced in early 2006 that they would have a child together, and Jolie gave birth to daughter Shiloh that May. They also adopted a three-year-old Vietnamese boy named Pax. The couple, who married in 2014 and divorced in 2019, continue to pursue movie and humanitarian projects, and now have a total of six children. She was appointed Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George at the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours for her services to United Kingdom foreign policy and the campaign to end warzone sexual violence.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001191/?ref_=ls_i_37)\n37.

He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. His work comprised nineteen films, including\n10 Things I Hate About You (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147800/?ls)\n,\nThe Patriot (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187393/?ls)\n,\nA Knight's Tale (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183790/?ls)\n,\nMonster's Ball (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285742/?ls)\n,\nNed Kelly (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277941/?ls)\n,\nThe Brothers Grimm (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0355295/?ls)\n,\nLords of Dogtown (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0355702/?ls)\n,\nBrokeback Mountain (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/?ls)\n,\nCasanova (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402894/?ls)\n,\nCandy (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424880/?ls)\n,\nI'm Not There (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368794/?ls)\n,\nThe Dark Knight (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ls)\nand\nThe Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1054606/?ls)\n. He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.\nHeath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. His ancestry was Scottish, English, Irish, and Sephardi Jewish. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.\nHis first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called\nBlackrock (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118735/?ls)\n, a largely unimpressive cliché; an adolescent angst film about one boy's struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called\nSweat (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115379/?ls)\nabout a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was in\nHome and Away (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094481/?ls)\nfor a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in\nPaws (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119870/?ls)\n, a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy\nNathan Cavaleri (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0146749/?ls)\n's brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played \"Oberon\". A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then came\nTwo Hands (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145547/?ls)\n. He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in\nRoar (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118451/?ls)\nopposite then unknown\nVera Farmiga (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0267812/?ls)\n.\nThen Australian director\nGregor Jordan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0429963/?ls)\nauditioned him for the lead in\nTwo Hands (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145547/?ls)\n, which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller,\nTwo Hands (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145547/?ls)\nwas outstanding and helped him secure a role in\n10 Things I Hate About You (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147800/?ls)\n. After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama\nThe Patriot (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187393/?ls)\n.\nWhat followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in\nMonster's Ball (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285742/?ls)\n, but his version of\nNed Kelly (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277941/?ls)\nwas an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in\nBrokeback Mountain (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/?ls)\n. For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in in the film, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\nLedger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. His death occurred during editing of\nThe Dark Knight (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ls)\nand in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in\nThe Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1054606/?ls)\n.\nPosthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film\nI'm Not There (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368794/?ls)\n, which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter\nBob Dylan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001168/?ls)\n. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan's life and persona.\nA few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in '\nThe Dark Knight (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ls)\n. His untimely death cast a somber shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production. Ledger received more than thirty posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance as the Joker, the psychopathic clown prince of crime, in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he is the second actor to win an acting award posthumously after Peter Finch who won an Oscar for Network (Best Actor 1977)), the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004266/?ref_=ls_i_40)\n40.

His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was\nRoger Moore (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000549/?ls)\n's\nLive and Let Die (1973) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070328/?ls)\n; young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart.

Keira Knightley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461136/?ref_=ls_t_45)\nActress\nProducer\nCamera and Electrical Department\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/?ref_=ls_knf_45)\nKeira Christina Knightley was born March 26, 1985 in the South West Greater London suburb of Richmond. She is the daughter of actor\nWill Knightley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461139/?ls)\nand actress turned playwright\nSharman Macdonald (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0531930/?ls)\n. An older brother,\nCaleb Knightley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1045816/?ls)\n, was born in 1979. Her father is English, while her Scottish-born mother is of Scottish and Welsh origin. Brought up immersed in the acting profession from both sides - writing and performing - it is little wonder that the young Keira asked for her own agent at the age of three. She was granted one at the age of six and performed in her first TV role as \"Little Girl\" in\nRoyal Celebration (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308821/?ls)\n, aged seven.\nIt was discovered at an early age that Keira had severe difficulties in reading and writing. She was not officially dyslexic as she never sat the formal tests required of the British Dyslexia Association. Instead, she worked incredibly hard, encouraged by her family, until the problem had been overcome by her early teens. Her first multi-scene performance came in\nA Village Affair (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111627/?ls)\n, an adaptation of the lesbian love story by\nJoanna Trollope (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0873433/?ls)\n. This was followed by small parts in the British crime series\nThe Bill (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084987/?ls)\n, an exiled German princess in\nThe Treasure Seekers (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117957/?ls)\nand a much more substantial role as the young \"Judith Dunbar\" in\nGiles Foster (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0287821/?ls)\n's adaptation of\nRosamunde Pilcher (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683362/?ls)\n's novel\nComing Home (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158653/?ls)\n, alongside\nPeter O'Toole (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000564/?ls)\n,\nPenelope Keith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0445285/?ls)\nand\nJoanna Lumley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525921/?ls)\n. The first time Keira's name was mentioned around the world was when it was revealed (in a plot twist kept secret by director\nGeorge Lucas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000184/?ls)\n) that she played\nNatalie Portman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000204/?ls)\n's decoy \"Padme\" to Portman's \"Amidala\" in\nStar Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120915/?ls)\n. It was several years before agreement was reached over which scenes featured Keira as the queen and which featured Natalie!\nKeira had no formal training as an actress and did it out of pure enjoyment. She went to an ordinary council-run school in nearby Teddington and had no idea what she wanted to do when she left. By now, she was beginning to receive far more substantial roles and was starting to turn work down as one project and her schoolwork was enough to contend with. She reappeared on British television in 1999 as \"Rose Fleming\" in\nAlan Bleasdale (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088062/?ls)\n's faithful reworking of\nCharles Dickens (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002042/?ls)\n'\nOliver Twist (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222608/?ls)\n, and traveled to Romania to film her first title role in\nWalt Disney (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000370/?ls)\n's\nPrincess of Thieves (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272790/?ls)\nin which she played Robin Hood's daughter, Gwyn. Keira's first serious boyfriend was her\nPrincess of Thieves (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272790/?ls)\nco-star\nDel Synnott (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0843435/?ls)\n, and they later co-starred in\nPeter Hewitt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382072/?ls)\n's 'work of fart'\nThunderpants (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283054/?ls)\n.\nNick Hamm (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0358327/?ls)\n's dark thriller\nThe Hole (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242527/?ls)\nkept her busy during 2000, and featured her first nude scene (15 at the time, the film was not released until she was 16 years old). In the summer of 2001, while Keira studied and sat her final school exams (she received six A's), she filmed a movie about an Asian girl's (\nParminder Nagra (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619406/?ls)\n) love for football and the prejudices she has to overcome regarding both her culture and her religion).\nBend It Like Beckham (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/?ls)\nwas a smash hit in football-mad Britain but it had to wait until another of Keira's films propelled it to the top end of the US box office.\nBend It Like Beckham (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/?ls)\ncost just £3.5m to make, and nearly £1m of that came from the British Lottery. It took £11m in the UK and has since gone on to score more than US$76m worldwide.\nMeanwhile, Keira had started A-levels at Esher College, studying Classics, English Literature and Political History, but continued to take acting roles which she thought would widen her experience as an actress. The story of a drug-addicted waitress and her friendship with the young son of a drug-addict,\nPure (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308772/?ls)\n, occupied Keira from January to March 2002. Also at this time, Keira's first attempt at Shakespeare was filmed. She played \"Helena\" in a modern interpretation of a scene from \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" entitled\nThe Seasons Alter (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399618/?ls)\n. This was commissioned by the environmental organization \"Futerra\", of which Keira's mother is patron. Keira received no fee for this performance or for another short film,\nNew Year's Eve (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378437/?ls)\n, by award-winning director\nCol Spector (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2980191/?ls)\n. But it was a chance encounter with producer\nAndy Harries (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364170/?ls)\nat the London premiere of\nBridget Jones's Diary (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243155/?ls)\nwhich forced Keira to leave her studies and pursue acting full-time. The meeting lead to an audition for the role of \"Larisa Feodorovna Guishar\" - the classic heroine of\nBoris Pasternak (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0664985/?ls)\n's novel\nDoctor Zhivago (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0324937/?ls)\n, played famously in the\nDavid Lean (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000180/?ls)\nmovie by\nJulie Christie (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001046/?ls)\n. This was to be a big-budget TV movie with a screenplay written by\nAndrew Davies (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0203577/?ls)\n. Keira won the part and the mini-series was filmed throughout the Spring of 2002 in Slovakia, co-starring\nSam Neill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000554/?ls)\nand\nHans Matheson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0558548/?ls)\nas \"Yuri Zhivago\". Keira rounded off 2002 with a few scenes in the first movie to be directed by Blackadder and Vicar of Dibley writer\nRichard Curtis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193485/?ls)\n. Called\nLove Actually (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314331/?ls)\n, Keira played \"Juliet\", a newlywed whose husband's Best Man is secretly besotted with her. A movie filmed after\nLove Actually (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314331/?ls)\nbut released before it was to make the world sit up and take notice of this beautiful fresh-faced young actress with a cute British accent. It was a movie which Keira very nearly missed out on, altogether. Auditions were held in London for a new blockbuster movie called\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/?ls)\n, but heavy traffic in the city forced Keira to be tagged on to the end of the day's auditions list. It helped - she got the part. Filming took place in Los Angeles and the Caribbean from October 2002 to March 2003 and was released to massive box office success and almost universal acclaim in the July of that year.\nMeanwhile, a small British film called\nBend It Like Beckham (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/?ls)\nhad sneaked onto a North American release slate and was hardly setting the box office alight. But Keira's dominance in \"Pirates\" had set tongues wagging and questions being asked about the actress playing \"Elizabeth Swann\". Almost too late, \"Bend It\"'s distributors realized one of its two stars was the same girl whose name was on everyone's lips due to \"Pirates\", and took the unusual step of re-releasing \"Bend It\" to 1,000 screens across the US, catapulting it from no. 26 back up to no. 12. \"Pirates\", meanwhile, was fighting off all contenders at the top spot, and stayed in the Top 3 for an incredible 21 weeks. It was perhaps no surprise, then, that Keira was on producer\nJerry Bruckheimer (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000988/?ls)\n's wanted list for the part of \"Guinevere\" in a planned accurate telling of the legend of \"King Arthur\". Filming took place in Ireland and Wales from June to November 2003. In July, Keira had become the celebrity face of British jeweller and luxury goods retailer, Asprey. At a photoshoot for the company on Long Island New York in August, Keira met and fell in love with Northern Irish model\nJamie Dornan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1946193/?ls)\n.\nKing Arthur (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349683/?ls)\nwas released in July 2004 to lukewarm reviews. It seems audiences wanted the legend after all, and not necessarily the truth. Keira became the breakout star and 'one to watch in 2004' throughout the world's media at the end of 2003.\nKeira's 2004 started off in Scotland and Canada filming\nJohn Maybury (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0562266/?ls)\n's time-travelling thriller\nThe Jacket (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366627/?ls)\nwith Oscar-winner\nAdrien Brody (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004778/?ls)\n. A planned movie of\nDeborah Moggach (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0595738/?ls)\n's novel, \"Tulip Fever\", about forbidden love in 17th Century Amsterdam, was canceled in February after the British government suddenly closed tax loopholes which allowed filmmakers to claw back a large proportion of their expenditure. Due to star Keira and\nJude Law (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000179/?ls)\nin the main roles, the film remains mothballed. Instead, Keira spent her time wisely, visiting Ethiopia on behalf of the \"Comic Relief\" charity, and spending summer at various grandiose locations around the UK filming what promises to be a faithful adaptation of\nJane Austen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000807/?ls)\n's classic novel\nPride & Prejudice (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414387/?ls)\n, alongside\nMatthew Macfadyen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0532193/?ls)\nas \"Mr. Darcy\", and with\nDonald Sutherland (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000661/?ls)\nand\nJudi Dench (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001132/?ls)\nin supporting roles. In October 2004, Keira received her first major accolade, the Hollywood Film Award for Best Breakthrough Actor - Female, and readers of Empire Magazine voted her the Sexiet Movie Star Ever. The remainder of 2004 saw Keira once again trying a completely new genre, this time the part-fact, part-fiction life story of model turned bounty hunter Domino (2005).\n2005 started with the premiere of The Jacket (2005) at the Sundance Film Festival, with the US premiere in LA on February 28th. Much of the year was then spent in the Caribbean filming both sequels to Pirates Of The Caribbean. Keira's first major presenting role came in a late-night bed-in comedy clip show for Comic Relief with presenter Johnny Vaughan. In late July, promotions started for the September release of Pride & Prejudice (2005), with British fans annoyed to learn that the US version would end with a post-marriage kiss, but the European version would not. Nevertheless, when the movie opened in September on both sides of the Atlantic, Keira received her greatest praise thus far in her career, amid much talk of awards. It spent three weeks at No. 1 in the UK box office.\nDomino (2005) opened well in October, overshadowed by the death of Domino Harvey earlier in the year. Keira received Variety's Personality Of The Year Award in November, topped the following month by her first Golden Globe nomination, for Pride & Prejudice (2005). KeiraWeb.com exclusively announced that Keira would play Helene Joncour in an adaptation of Alessandro Baricco's novella Silk (2007). Pride & Prejudice (2005) garnered six BAFTA nominations at the start of 2006, but not Best Actress for Keira, a fact which paled soon after by the announcement she had received her first Academy Award nomination, the third youngest Best Actress Oscar hopeful. A controversial nude Vanity Fair cover of Keira and\nScarlett Johansson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424060/?ls)\nkept the press busy up till the Oscars, with\nReese Witherspoon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000702/?ls)\ntaking home the gold man in the Best Actress category, although Keira's Vera Wang dress got more media attention. Keira spent early summer in Europe filming Silk (2007) opposite\nMichael Pitt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0685856/?ls)\n, and the rest of the summer in the UK filming Atonement (2007), in which she plays Cecilia Tallis, and promoting the new Pirates movie (her Ellen Degeneres interview became one of the year's Top 10 'viral downloads'). Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) broke many box office records when it opens worldwide in July, becoming the third biggest movie ever by early September. Keira sued British newspaper The Daily Mail in early 2007 after her image in a bikini accompanied an article about a woman who blamed slim celebrities for the death of her daughter from anorexia. The case was settled and Keira matched the settlement damages and donated the total amount to an eating disorder charity. Keira filmed a movie about the life of Dylan Thomas, The Edge Of Love (2008) with a screenplay written by her mother\nSharman Macdonald (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0531930/?ls)\n. Her co-star\nLindsay Lohan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0517820/?ls)\npulled out just a week before filming began, and was replaced by\nSienna Miller (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1092227/?ls)\n.\nWhat was announced to be Keira's final Pirates movie in the franchise, Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End (2007), opened strongly in June, rising to all-time fifth biggest movie by July. Atonement (2007) opened the Venice Film Festival in August, and opened worldwide in September, again to superb reviews for Keira. Meanwhile, Silk (2007) opened in September on very few screens and disappeared without a trace. Keira spent the rest of the year filming The Duchess (2008), the life story of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, based on Amanda Foreman's award-winning biography of the distant relation of Princess Diana. The year saw more accolades and poll-topping for Keira than ever before, including Women's Beauty Icon 2007 and gracing the covers of all the top-selling magazines. She won Best Actress for Atonement (2007) at the Variety Club Of Great Britain Showbiz Awards, and ended the year with her second Golden Globe nomination. Christmas Day saw - or rather heard - Keira on British TV screens in a new Robbie The Reindeer animated adventure, with DVD proceeds going to Comic Relief. At the start of 2008, Keira received her first BAFTA nomination - Best Actress for Atonement, and the movie wins Best Film: Drama at the Golden Globes. Seven Academy Award nominations for Atonement soon follow. Keira wins Best Actress for her role as Cecilia Tallis at the Empire Film Awards. In May, Keira's first Shakespearean role is announced, when she is confirmed to play Cordelia in a big-screen version of King Lear, alongside Naomi Watts and Gwyneth Paltrow, with Sir Anthony Hopkins as the titular monarch. After two years of rumours, it is confirmed that Keira is on the shortlist to play Eliza Doolittle in a new adaptation of My Fair Lady. The Edge Of Love opens the Edinburgh Film Festival on June 18th, and opens on limited release in the UK and US. A huge round of promotions for The Duchess occurs throughout the summer, with cast and crew trying to play down the marketers' decision to draw parallels between the duchess and Princess Diana. Keira attends the UK and US premieres and Toronto Film Festival within the first week of September. The Duchess opens strongly on both sides of the Atlantic. Two more movies were confirmed for Keira during September - a tale of adultery called\nLast Night (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1294688/?ls)\n, and a biopic of author F Scott Fitzgerald entitled\nThe Beautiful and the Damned (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1181615/?ls)\n.\nKeira spent October on the streets of New York City filming Last Night alongside\nSam Worthington (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0941777/?ls)\nand\nGuillaume Canet (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0133899/?ls)\n. Keira helped to promote the sixtieth anniversary of the UN's Declaration of Human Rights, by contributing to a series of short films produced to mark the occasion. In January 2009 it was announced Keira had signed to play a reclusive actress in an adaptation of Ken Bruen's novel\nLondon Boulevard (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213648/?ls)\n, co-starring\nColin Farrell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0268199/?ls)\n. Keira continues her close ties with the Comic Relief charity by helping to launch their British icons T-shirts campaign. In the same week King Lear was revealed to have been shelved, it was announced that Keira would instead star alongside her Pride & Prejudice co-star Carey Mulligan in an adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel\nNever Let Me Go (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/?ls)\n. A new short film emerges in March, recorded in the January of 2008 in which Keira plays a Fairy!\nThe Continuing and Lamentable Saga of the Suicide Brothers (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1471349/?ls)\nwas written by Keira's boyfriend\nRupert Friend (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1670029/?ls)\nand actor\nTom Mison (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2070427/?ls)\n. It went to be shown at the London Film Festival in October and won Best Comedy Short at the New Hampshire Film Festival. Keira continued to put her celebrity to good use in 2009 with a TV commercial for WomensAid highlighting domestic abuse against women. Unfortunately, UK censors refused to allow its broadcast and it can only be viewed on YouTube. May and June saw Keira filming\nNever Let Me Go (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/?ls)\nand\nLondon Boulevard (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213648/?ls)\nback-to-back. In October, a new direction for Keira's career emerged, when it was announced she would appear on the London stage in her West End debut role as Jennifer, in a reworking of Moliere's The Misanthrope, starring\nDamian Lewis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507073/?ls)\nand\nTara Fitzgerald (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001216/?ls)\n. More than $2m of ticket sales followed in the first four days, before even rehearsals had begun! The play ran from December to March at London's Comedy Theatre.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/?ref_=ls_i_46)\n46. Christopher Nolan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/?ref_=ls_t_46)\nWriter\nProducer\nDirector\nTenet (2020) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6723592/?ref_=ls_knf_46)\nBest known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling, acclaimed Academy Award winner writer/director/producer Sir\nChristopher Nolan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/?ls)\nCBE was born in London, England. Over the course of more than 25 years of filmmaking, Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to working on some of the biggest blockbusters ever made and became one of the most celebrated filmmakers of modern cinema.\nAt 7 years old, Nolan began making short films with his father's Super-8 camera. While studying English Literature at University College London, he shot 16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature,\nFollowing (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154506/?ls)\n, on a budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film festivals prior to its theatrical release and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather substantial financing for his next film.\nNolan's second film was\nMemento (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/?ls)\n, which he directed from his own screenplay based on a short story by his brother\nJonathan Nolan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634300/?ls)\n. Starring\nGuy Pearce (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001602/?ls)\n, the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay. Nolan went on to direct the critically acclaimed psychological thriller,\nInsomnia (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278504/?ls)\n, starring\nAl Pacino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/?ls)\n,\nRobin Williams (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245/?ls)\nand\nHilary Swank (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005476/?ls)\n.\nThe turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was awarded the chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In\nBatman Begins (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/?ls)\n, Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero, and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from fans and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller\nThe Prestige (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/?ls)\n, starring\nChristian Bale (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/?ls)\nand\nHugh Jackman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413168/?ls)\nas magicians whose obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.\nIn 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced\nThe Dark Knight (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ls)\n. Co-written with by his brother Jonathan, the film went on to gross more than a billion dollars at the worldwide box office. Nolan was nominated for a Directors Guild of America (D.G.A.) Award, Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) Award and Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award, and the film also received eight Academy Award nominations. The film is widely considered one of the best comic book adaptations of all times, with\nHeath Ledger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005132/?ls)\n's performance as the Joker receiving an extremely high acclaim. Ledger posthumously became the first Academy Award winning performance in a Nolan film.\nIn 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the Sci-Fi thriller\nInception (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/?ls)\n, starring\nLeonardo DiCaprio (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/?ls)\nin the lead role, which he directed and produced from his own original screenplay that he worked on for almost a decade. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster, earning more than $800,000,000 and becoming one of the most discussed and debated films of the year, and of all times. Among its many honors, Inception received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with a W.G.A. Award accolade, as well as D.G.A. and P.G.A. Awards nominations for his work on the film.\nAs one of the best-reviewed and highest-grossing movies of 2012,\nThe Dark Knight Rises (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345836/?ls)\nconcluded Nolan's Batman trilogy. Due to his success rebooting the Batman character, Warner Bros. enlisted Nolan to produce their revamped Superman movie\nMan of Steel (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770828/?ls)\n, which opened in the summer of 2013. In 2014, Nolan directed, wrote, and produced the Science-Fiction epic\nInterstellar (2014) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ls)\n, starring\nMatthew McConaughey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000190/?ls)\n,\nAnne Hathaway (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004266/?ls)\nand\nJessica Chastain (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1567113/?ls)\n. Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. released the film on November 5, 2014, to positive reviews and strong box-office results, grossing over $670 million dollars worldwide.\nIn July 2017, Nolan released his acclaimed War epic\nDunkirk (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/?ls)\n, that earned him his first Best Director nomination at the Academy Awards, as well as winning an additional 3 Oscars. In 2020 he released his mind-bending Sci-Fi espionage thriller\nTenet (2020) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6723592/?ls)\nstarring\nJohn David Washington (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0913475/?ls)\nin the lead role. Released during the COVID-19 pandemic, the movie grossed relatively less than Nolan's previous blockbusters, though it did do good numbers compared to other movies in that period of time. Hailed as Nolan's most complex film yet, the film was one of Nolan's less-acclaimed films at the time, yet slowly built a fan-base following in later years.\nIn July 2023, Nolan released his highly acclaimed biographic drama\nOppenheimer (2023) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/?ls)\nstarring Nolan's frequent collaborator\nCillian Murphy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614165/?ls)\n- in the lead role for the first time in a Nolan film.

He is of Scottish, Northern Irish, and English descent. During his early childhood, his parents moved with Ian and his older sister, Jean, to the mill town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian rode out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theatre, which was encouraged by his parents. They would take him to plays, those by\nWilliam Shakespeare (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000636/?ls)\n, in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian's growing passion for theatre.\nWhen Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\". Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theatre festivals, where he saw the greats perform:\nLaurence Olivier (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000059/?ls)\n,\nWendy Hiller (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0384908/?ls)\n,\nJohn Gielgud (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000024/?ls)\n,\nRalph Richardson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0724732/?ls)\nand\nPaul Robeson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0732079/?ls)\n. He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest.\nMcKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian's homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing\nMargaret Thatcher (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0857137/?ls)\n's \"Section 28\" legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offense. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand. He has been active in the gay rights movement ever since.\nIan resides in Limehouse, where he has also lived with his former long-time partner\nSean Mathias (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0558773/?ls)\n. The two men have also worked together on the film\nBent (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118698/?ls)\nas well as in exquisite stage productions. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theatre, and was knighted by\nQueen Elizabeth II (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0703070/?ls)\nin 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare's works including his well received\nRichard III (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114279/?ls)\n, and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films,\nCold Comfort Farm (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112701/?ls)\n,\nApt Pupil (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118636/?ls)\nand\nGods and Monsters (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120684/?ls)\n, riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen's role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen, as he continues to work extensively on stage, he always keeps in 'solidifying' his 'role' as Laurence Olivier's worthy 'successor' in the best sense too, such as\nKing Lear (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2049483/?ls)\n/\nKing Lear (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1175295/?ls)\ndirected by\nTrevor Nunn (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0638080/?ls)\nand in a range of other staggering performances full of generously euphoric delight that have included \"Peter Pan\" and\nNoël Coward (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002021/?ls)\n's \"Present Laughter\", as well as\nSamuel Beckett (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0065716/?ls)\n's \"Waiting for Godot\" and\nHarold Pinter (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0056217/?ls)\n's \"No Man's Land\" (\nNational Theatre Live: No Man's Land (2016) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6427146/?ls)\n), both in acclaimed productions brilliantly directed by\nSean Mathias (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0558773/?ls)\n.\nMcKellen found mainstream success with his performance as Magneto in\nX-Men (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/?ls)\nand its sequels. His largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy directed by\nPeter Jackson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001392/?ls)\n, which he reprised in \"The Hobbit\" trilogy. He also reprised the role of 'King Lear' with new artistic perspectives in\nNational Theatre Live: King Lear (2018) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9055926/?ls)\noffering an invaluable mesmerizing experience as a natural force of stage - and screen - of infinite generosity through his unsurpassable interpretation of the titanically vulnerable king.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000932/?ref_=ls_i_52)\n52.

His sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. is seen by some as a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective \"John McClane\" in the monster hit\nDie Hard (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/?ls)\n, in which Willis' character single-handedly battled a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. He reprised the role of McClane in the sequel,\nDie Hard 2 (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099423/?ls)\n, set at a snowbound Washington's Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel\nDie Hard with a Vengeance (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112864/?ls)\n, this time co-starring\nSamuel L.

His father was of Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent, and his mother was of Irish Catholic descent (she\nconverted to Judaism).\nHis parents made no real effort to keep their son away from the Hollywood lifestyle and he grew up among the stars, wondering\njust why his parents were so popular. At a young age, he and his sister\nAmy Stiller (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0830243/?ls)\nwould perform plays at home, wearing Amy's tights to perform Shakespeare. Ben also picked up an interest in being on the other side of the camera and, at age 10, began shooting films on his Super 8 camera. The plots were always simple: someone would pick on the shy, awkward Stiller ... and then he would\nalways get his revenge. This desire for revenge on the popular, good-looking people may have motivated his teen-angst opus\nReality Bites (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110950/?ls)\nlater in his career. He both directed and performed in the film, which co-starred\nWinona Ryder (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000213/?ls)\nand\nEthan Hawke (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000160/?ls)\n.\nBefore he got to Hollywood, he put in several consistently solid years in the theater. After dropping out of UCLA, he performed in the Tony Award winner, \"The House of Blue Leaves\". While working on the play, Stiller shot a short spoof of\nThe Color of Money (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090863/?ls)\nstarring him (in the\nTom Cruise (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/?ls)\nrole) and his\nThe House of Blue Leaves (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093222/?ls)\ncostar\nJohn Mahoney (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001498/?ls)\n(in the\nPaul Newman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000056/?ls)\nrole). The short film was so funny that\nLorne Michaels (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0584427/?ls)\npurchased it and aired it on\nSaturday Night Live (1975) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072562/?ls)\n. This led to his spending a year on the show in 1989.\nStiller made his big screen debut in\nSteven Spielberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/?ls)\n's\nEmpire of the Sun (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092965/?ls)\nin 1987. Demonstrating early on the multifaceted tone his career would take, he soon stepped behind the camera to direct Back to Brooklyn for MTV. The network was impressed and gave Stiller his own show,\nThe Ben Stiller Show (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103360/?ls)\n. He recruited fellow offbeat comedians\nJaneane Garofalo (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000413/?ls)\nand\nAndy Dick (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004873/?ls)\nand created a bitingly\nsatirical show. MTV ended up passing on it, but it was picked up by Fox. Unfortunately, the show was a ratings miss. Stiller was soon out\nof work, although he did have the satisfaction of picking up an Emmy for the show after its cancellation.\nFor a while, Stiller had to settle for guest appearance work. While doing this, he saved up his cash and in the end was able to scrape\nenough together to make\nReality Bites (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110950/?ls)\n, now a cult classic which is looked upon favorably by the generation it depicted.\nBen continued to work steadily for a time, particularly in independent productions where he was more at ease. However, he never quite managed to catch a big break. His first big budget directing job was\nJim Carrey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000120/?ls)\n's\nThe Cable Guy (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115798/?ls)\n. Although many\ncritics were impressed,\nJim Carrey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000120/?ls)\n's fans were not. In 1998,\nThere's Something About Mary (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129387/?ls)\nhad propelled Stiller into the mainstream spotlight.

He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theatre manager, in an artists' housing project in New York City's Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father's background, Diesel has said that he himself is \"definitely a person of colour\".\nHis first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin's fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York's hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel.\nFollowing high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called \"Feature Films at used Car Prices\" by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called\nMulti-Facial (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0226168/?ls)\n, which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000.\nMulti-Facial (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0226168/?ls)\nwas eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception.\nAfterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature,\nStrays (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149171/?ls)\n. Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call.\nSteven Spielberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/?ls)\nwas impressed by\nMulti-Facial (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0226168/?ls)\nand wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in\nSaving Private Ryan (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/?ls)\n.\nMulti-Facial (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0226168/?ls)\nearned Vin more work, when the director of\nThe Iron Giant (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129167/?ls)\nsaw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin's career steadily grew, with him securing his first lead role, as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film\nPitch Black (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134847/?ls)\n. The role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves.\nSince then, he has headlined a series of blockbusters, often but not only centered on fast-driving motor vehicles:\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0232500/?ls)\n,\nxXx (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295701/?ls)\n,\nThe Pacifier (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395699/?ls)\n,\nFast & Furious (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1013752/?ls)\n,\nFast Five (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596343/?ls)\n,\nFast & Furious 6 (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1905041/?ls)\n, and\nFurious 7 (2015) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2820852/?ls)\n.

Jean-Claude was awarded a first\nround victory.\nJean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following\na knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels,Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a\n18-1 (18 knockouts) Kickboxing record, and a Semi-Contact record of\n41-4. He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt\ninsured to do action movies in Hong Kong. In 1981 Van Damme moved to\nLos Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer,\npizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to\nChuck Norris (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001569/?ls)\nhe got a job as a bouncer at a\nclub. Norris gave Van Damme a small role in the movie\nMissing in Action (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087727/?ls)\n, but\nit wasn't good enough to get anybody's attention. Then in 1984 he got a\nrole as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie\nNo Retreat, No Surrender (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089695/?ls)\n.\nThen one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a\nproducer for Cannon Pictures, and showed some of his martial arts\nabilities which led to a role in\nBloodsport (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092675/?ls)\n. But the movie,\nfilmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved\nfor almost two years. It might have never been released if Van Damme\ndid not help them to recut the film and begged producers to release it.\nThey finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then\ninto the U.S. Shot on a meager $1.5 million dollar budget, it became a\nU.S box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about $50 million\nworldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational\naction star Jean-Claude Van Damme.\nHis martial arts assets, highlighted\nby his ability to deliver a kick to an opponent's head during a leaping\n360-degree turn, and his good looks led to starring roles in higher\nbudgeted movies like\nCyborg (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097138/?ls)\n,\nLionheart (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100029/?ls)\n,\nDouble Impact (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101764/?ls)\nand\nUniversal Soldier (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105698/?ls)\n. In\n1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit\nTimecop (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111438/?ls)\n. But in the meantime, his\npersonal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage,\nfollowed by another divorce. It began to show up in his career when his\nprojects began to tank at the box office -\nThe Quest (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117420/?ls)\n, which he directed;\nMaximum Risk (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117011/?ls)\nand\nDouble Team (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119013/?ls)\n. The three films\nmade less than $50 million combined. In 1999 he remarried his ex-wife\nGladys Portugues (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0692543/?ls)\nand restarted his lost\ncareer to attain new goals. With help from his family he faced his\nproblems and made movies like\nReplicant (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238552/?ls)\n,\nDerailed (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298296/?ls)\n, and\nIn Hell (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339135/?ls)\nwhich did averagely in box\noffice terms, but he tried to give his fans the best, his acting in\nthose movies got better, more emotional and each movie was basically in\ndifferent action tones.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005562/?ref_=ls_i_72)\n72. Owen Wilson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005562/?ref_=ls_t_72)\nActor\nProducer\nWriter\nThe Royal Tenenbaums (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/?ref_=ls_knf_72)\nSelf-proclaimed troublemaker Owen Cunningham Wilson was born in Dallas, to Irish-American parents originally from Massachusetts. He grew up in Texas with his mother, Laura (Cunningham), a photographer; his father, Robert Andrew Wilson, an ad exec; and his brothers,\nAndrew Wilson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932992/?ls)\n(the eldest) and\nLuke Wilson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005561/?ls)\n(the youngest). Expelled from St. Mark's School of Texas (Dallas, TX) in the tenth grade, Wilson finished his sophomore year at Thomas Jefferson School and then headed to a military academy in New Mexico. He then attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he met his future mentor and friend,\nWes Anderson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027572/?ls)\n. They wrote a screenplay,\nBottle Rocket (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115734/?ls)\n, and sent it to their family friend, screenwriter\nL.M. Kit Carson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141281/?ls)\n, who sent it to producer\nPolly Platt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0686895/?ls)\n, who gave it to\nJames L. Brooks (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000985/?ls)\n, who gave the Texans $5 million to make it into a feature film. Despite critical praise,\nBottle Rocket (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115734/?ls)\nonly grossed one million dollars. After making the film, Wilson moved to Hollywood, setting up house with his two brothers and Anderson. Fairly quickly, Owen found himself acting in a series of big budget films, such as\nThe Cable Guy (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115798/?ls)\n,\nThe Haunting (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171363/?ls)\n,\nAnaconda (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118615/?ls)\nand\nBreakfast of Champions (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120618/?ls)\n. This led to more work, such as\nShanghai Noon (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184894/?ls)\n,\nMeet the Parents (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212338/?ls)\nand\nBehind Enemy Lines (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159273/?ls)\n. He's known not only for his nose, which has been broken several times, but also for his 'free wheeling ways' with a script. He co-wrote the film\nThe Royal Tenenbaums (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/?ls)\nwith his oft partner\nWes Anderson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027572/?ls)\n.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/?ref_=ls_i_73)\n73. Christian Bale (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/?ref_=ls_t_73)\nActor\nProducer\nEditorial Department\nThe Dark Knight (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ref_=ls_knf_73)\nChristian Charles Philip Bale was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK on January 30, 1974, to English parents Jennifer \"Jenny\" (James) and\nDavid Bale (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1186739/?ls)\n. His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale's childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.\nHis first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in \"The Nerd\". A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series\nAnastasia: The Mystery of Anna (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090638/?ls)\ncaught\nSteven Spielberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/?ls)\n's eye, leading to Bale's well-documented role in\nEmpire of the Sun (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092965/?ls)\n. For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.\nAdjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in\nKenneth Branagh (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000110/?ls)\n's 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare's\nHenry V (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097499/?ls)\nand starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of\nTreasure Island (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100813/?ls)\n. Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in\nNewsies (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104990/?ls)\n,\nSwing Kids (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108265/?ls)\n,\nLittle Women (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110367/?ls)\n,\nThe Portrait of a Lady (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117364/?ls)\n,\nThe Secret Agent (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117582/?ls)\n,\nMetroland (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119665/?ls)\n,\nVelvet Goldmine (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120879/?ls)\n,\nAll the Little Animals (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120584/?ls)\n, and\nA Midsummer Night's Dream (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140379/?ls)\n. Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.\nBale roared into the next decade with a lead role in\nAmerican Psycho (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/?ls)\n, director\nMary Harron (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366004/?ls)\n's adaptation of the controversial\nBret Easton Ellis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0254735/?ls)\nnovel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for \"Entertainment Weekly\" crowned Bale one of the \"Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures\" of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the \"Most Creative People in Entertainment\", and \"Premiere\" lauded him as one of the \"Hottest Leading Men Under 30\".\nBale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake\nShaft (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162650/?ls)\n,\nCaptain Corelli's Mandolin (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238112/?ls)\n, the balmy\nLaurel Canyon (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298408/?ls)\n, and\nReign of Fire (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253556/?ls)\n, a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.\nTwo more cult films followed:\nEquilibrium (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238380/?ls)\nand\nThe Machinist (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361862/?ls)\n, the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale's physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.\nBale's abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in\nBatman Begins (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/?ls)\n, the first chapter in\nChristopher Nolan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/?ls)\n's definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of\nBatman & Robin (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/?ls)\n. A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.\nBale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman's phenomenal success:\nThe New World (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402399/?ls)\nand\nHarsh Times (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433387/?ls)\n. He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006's\nRescue Dawn (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462504/?ls)\n,\nWerner Herzog (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001348/?ls)\n's feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary,\nLittle Dieter Needs to Fly (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145046/?ls)\n. Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred in\nThe Prestige (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/?ls)\n, the remake of\n3:10 to Yuma (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381849/?ls)\n, and a reunion with director\nTodd Haynes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001331/?ls)\nin the experimental\nBob Dylan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001168/?ls)\nbiography,\nI'm Not There (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368794/?ls)\n.\nAnticipation for\nThe Dark Knight (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ls)\nwas spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing of\nHeath Ledger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005132/?ls)\n, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale's graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.\nBale's next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less\nTerminator Salvation (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438488/?ls)\n, followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in\nMichael Mann (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000520/?ls)\n's\nPublic Enemies (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1152836/?ls)\n. Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.\nFor all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of\nThe Fighter (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964517/?ls)\n's critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward, played by\nMark Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000242/?ls)\n. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.\nBale then turned to another auteur,\nYimou Zhang (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955443/?ls)\n, for the epic\nThe Flowers of War (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1410063/?ls)\n, in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government.\nBale capped his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in\nThe Dark Knight Rises (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345836/?ls)\n; in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller\nOut of the Furnace (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206543/?ls)\nwith\nCrazy Heart (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1263670/?ls)\nwriter/director\nScott Cooper (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0178376/?ls)\n, and the drama-comedy\nAmerican Hustle (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1800241/?ls)\n, reuniting with David O. Russell.\nBale will re-team with\nThe New World (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402399/?ls)\ndirector\nTerrence Malick (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000517/?ls)\nfor two upcoming projects:\nKnight of Cups (2015) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2101383/?ls)\nand an as-yet-untitled drama.\nIn his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation. He lives with his wife,\nSibi Blazic (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088023/?ls)\n, and their two children.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001392/?ref_=ls_i_74)\n74.

Donald Sutherland (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000661/?ref_=ls_t_1)\nActor\nProducer\nWriter\nThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951264/?ref_=ls_knf_1)\nThe towering presence of Canadian actor Donald Sutherland was often\nnoticed, as were his legendary contributions to cinema. He appeared in almost 200 different shows and films. He was also the father of renowned actor\nKiefer Sutherland (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000662/?ls)\n, among others.\nDonald McNichol Sutherland was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, to Dorothy Isobel\n(McNichol) and Frederick McLea Sutherland, who worked in sales and\nelectricity. He had Scottish, as well as German and English, ancestry. Sutherland\nworked in several different jobs - he was a radio DJ in his youth - and\nwas almost set on becoming an engineer after graduating from the\nUniversity of Toronto with a degree in engineering. However, he also\ngraduated with a degree in drama, and he chose to abandon becoming an\nengineer in favour of an actor.\nSutherland's first roles were bit parts and consisted of such films as\nthe horror film\nDr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059125/?ls)\nwhich starred\nChristopher Lee (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/?ls)\n.\nHe was also appearing in episodes of TV shows such as \"The Saint\" and\n\"Court Martial\". Sutherland's break would come soon, though, and it\nwould come in the form of a war film in which he was barely cast.\nThe reason he was barely cast was because he had been a last-minute\nreplacement for an actor that had dropped out of the film. The role he\nplayed was that of the dopey but loyal Vernon Pinkley in the war film\nThe Dirty Dozen (1967) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061578/?ls)\n. The film\nalso starred\nLee Marvin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001511/?ls)\n,\nCharles Bronson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000314/?ls)\n, and\nTelly Savalas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001699/?ls)\n. The picture was an instant\nsuccess as an action/war film, and Sutherland played upon this success\nby taking another role in a war film: this was, however, a comedy\ncalled\nM*A*S*H (1970) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066026/?ls)\nwhich landed Sutherland\nthe starring role alongside\nElliott Gould (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001285/?ls)\nand\nTom Skerritt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000643/?ls)\n. This is now\nconsidered a classic among film goers, and the 35-year old actor was\nonly getting warmed up.\nSutherland took a number of other roles in between these two films,\nsuch as the theatrical adaptation\nOedipus the King (1968) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063376/?ls)\n, the\nmusical\nJoanna (1968) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063157/?ls)\nand the\nClint Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142/?ls)\n-helmed war comedy\nKelly's Heroes (1970) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065938/?ls)\n. It was\nKelly's Heroes (1970) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065938/?ls)\nthat became\nmore well-known, and it reunited Sutherland with\nTelly Savalas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001699/?ls)\n. 1970 and 1971 offered\nSutherland a number of other films, the best of them would have to be\nKlute (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067309/?ls)\n. The film, which made\nJane Fonda (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000404/?ls)\na star, is about a prostitute\nwhose friend is mysteriously murdered. Sutherland received no critical\nacclaim like his co-star Fonda (she won an Oscar) but his career did\nnot fade.\nMoving on from\nKlute (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067309/?ls)\n, Sutherland\nlanded roles such as the lead in the thriller\nLady Ice (1973) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070284/?ls)\n, and another lead in the\nwestern\nAlien Thunder (1974) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069688/?ls)\n. These\nfilms did not match up to \"Klute\"'s success, though Sutherland took a\nsupporting role that would become one of his most infamous and most\ncritically acclaimed. He played the role of the murderous fascist\nleader in the\nBernardo Bertolucci (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000934/?ls)\nItalian epic\n1900 (1976) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074084/?ls)\n.\nSutherland also gained another memorable role as a marijuana-smoking\nuniversity professor in\nNational Lampoon's Animal House (1978) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077975/?ls)\namong other work\nthat he did in this time.\nAnother classic role came in the form of the\nRobert Redford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000602/?ls)\nfilm,\nOrdinary People (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081283/?ls)\n.\nSutherland portrayed an older father figure who must deal with his\nchildren in an emotional drama of a film. It won Best Picture, and\nwhile both the supporting stars were nominated for Oscars, Sutherland\nonce again did not receive any Academy Award nomination. He moved on to\nplay a Nazi spy in a film based on\nKen Follett (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0284336/?ls)\n's book \"Eye of the Needle\" and\nhe would star alongside\nAl Pacino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/?ls)\nin the\ncommercial and critical disaster that was\nRevolution (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089913/?ls)\n. While it drove\nAl Pacino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/?ls)\nout of films for four years,\nSutherland continued to find work. This work led to the dramatic,\nwell-told story of apartheid\nA Dry White Season (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097243/?ls)\nalongside the legendary actor\nMarlon Brando (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ls)\n.\nSutherland's next big success came in the\nOliver Stone (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000231/?ls)\nfilm\nJFK (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102138/?ls)\nwhere Sutherland plays the\nchilling role of Mister X, an anonymous source who gives crucial\ninformation about the politics surrounding President Kennedy. Once\nagain, he was passed over at the Oscars, though\nTommy Lee Jones (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169/?ls)\nwas nominated for his\nperformance as Clay Shaw. Sutherland went on to appear in\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103893/?ls)\n,\nShadow of the Wolf (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105377/?ls)\n, and\nDisclosure (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109635/?ls)\n.\nThe new millennium provided an interesting turn in Sutherland's career:\nreuniting with such former collaborators as\nClint Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142/?ls)\nand\nTommy Lee Jones (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169/?ls)\n, Sutherland starred in\nSpace Cowboys (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186566/?ls)\n. He also\nappeared as the father figure to\nNicole Kidman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000173/?ls)\n's character in\nCold Mountain (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159365/?ls)\nand\nCharlize Theron (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000234/?ls)\n's character in\nThe Italian Job (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317740/?ls)\n. He also made a fascinating, Oscar-worthy performance as the revolutionist\nMr. Thorne in\nLand of the Blind (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433405/?ls)\nand\nalso as a judge in\nReign Over Me (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490204/?ls)\n. He\nalso joined forces with his son\nRossif Sutherland (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1160472/?ls)\nand Canadian comic\nRussell Peters (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0992289/?ls)\nwith the new comedy\nThe Con Artist (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1401607/?ls)\n, as well as\nacting alongside\nJamie Bell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068260/?ls)\nand\nChanning Tatum (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1475594/?ls)\nin the sword-and-sandal\nfilm\nThe Eagle (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034389/?ls)\n. Sutherland\nalso taken a role in the remake of\nCharles Bronson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000314/?ls)\n's film\nThe Mechanic (1972) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068931/?ls)\n.\nDonald Sutherland made a lasting legacy on Hollywood, whether\nportraying a chilling and horrifying villain, or playing the older\nrespectable character in his films. A true character actor, Sutherland\nwas one of Canada's most well-known names and will hopefully continue to be remembered long after his time.\nBorn in\n()\n------------------------------\n------------------------------\nBAFTA Nominations: 0\n()\nBAFTA Wins: 0\n()\nGG Nominations: 0\n()\nGG Wins: 0\n()\nEmmy Nominations: 0\n()\nEmmy Wins: 0\n()\nTony Nominations: 0\n()\nTony Wins: 0\n()\nSAG Individual Nominations: 0\n()\nSAG Individual Wins: 0\n()\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000596/?ref_=ls_i_2)\n2.

After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the\nLee Strasberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833448/?ls)\nTheatre Institute.\nOn the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on\nThe Fugitive (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247097/?ls)\n(CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring\nHarrison Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/?ls)\n. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in\nCherry Falls (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175526/?ls)\nand\nThe Newcomers (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221431/?ls)\n- two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in\nBoston Public (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247081/?ls)\n(Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature,\nNot Another Teen Movie (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277371/?ls)\n, a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (\nChyler Leigh (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500200/?ls)\n) into prom queen.\nAfter filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful -\nJust Married (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305711/?ls)\nand\nEastwick (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362585/?ls)\n- he appeared in another listless teen comedy,\nThe Perfect Score (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314498/?ls)\n, playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\n, a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and\nKim Basinger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000107/?ls)\nas the damsel in distress,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\nfailed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in\nFantastic Four (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120667/?ls)\n, 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.\nThe year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance.\nThe Nanny Diaries (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489237/?ls)\n, where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie\nStreet Kings (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421073/?ls)\n, playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie\nThe Loss of a Teardrop Diamond (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0896031/?ls)\n.\nBorn in\n()\n------------------------------\n------------------------------\nBAFTA Nominations: 0\n()\nBAFTA Wins: 0\n()\nGG Nominations: 0\n()\nGG Wins: 0\n()\nEmmy Nominations: 0\n()\nEmmy Wins: 0\n()\nTony Nominations: 0\n()\nTony Wins: 0\n()\nSAG Individual Nominations: 0\n()\nSAG Individual Wins: 0\n()\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004936/?ref_=ls_i_20)\n20.

His paternal grandparents were from the Isle of Man and Ireland, respectively. He lives with his parents and three younger brothers - Paddy and twins Sam and Harry. Tom attended Donhead Prep School. Then, after a successful eleven plus exam, he became a pupil at Wimbledon College. Having successfully completed his GCSEs, in September 2012 Tom started a two-year course in the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology notable for its numerous famous alumni.\nHolland began dancing at a hip hop class at Nifty Feet Dance School in Wimbledon, London. His potential was spotted by choreographer Lynne Page (who was an Associate to Peter Darling, choreographer of Billy Elliot and Billy Elliot the Musical) when he performed with his dance school as part of the Richmond Dance Festival 2006. After eight auditions and subsequent two years of training, on 28 June 2008 Tom made his West End debut in Billy Elliot the Musical as Michael, Billy's best friend. He gave his first performance in the title role of Billy on 8 September 2008 getting rave reviews praising his versatile acting and dancing skills.\nIn September 2008 Tom (together with co-star Tanner Pflueger) appeared on the news programme on channel FIVE and gave his first TV interview. In 2009 Tom was featured on ITV1 show \"The Feel Good Factor\". At the launch show on 31 January he and two other Billy Elliots, Tanner Pflueger and Layton Williams, performed a specially choreographered version of Angry Dance from Billy Elliot the Musical, after which Tom was interviewed by host Myleene Klass. Then he became involved into training five ordinary British schoolboys learning to get fit and preparing their dance routine (fronted by Tom) for the final \"The Feel Good Factor\" show on 28 March 2009. On 11 March 2010, Tom, along with fellow Billy Elliots Dean-Charles Chapman and Fox Jackson-Keen appeared on The Alan Titchmarsh Show on ITV1.\nOn 8 March 2010, to mark the fifth anniversary of Billy Elliot the Musical, four current Billy Elliots, including Tom Holland, were invited to 10 Downing Street to meet the Prime Minister Gordon Brown. It was Tom Holland who was chosen to be a lead at the special fifth anniversary show on 31 March 2010. Elton John, Billy Elliot the Musical composer, who was at the audience, called Tom's performance \"astonishing\" and said that he was \"blown away\" by it. Holland had been appearing on a regular basis as Billy in Billy Elliot the Musical rotating with three other performers till 29 May 2010 when he finished his run in the musical.\nIn two months after leaving Billy Elliot the Musical, Holland successfully auditioned for a starring role in the film The Impossible (directed by Juan Antonio Bayona) alongside Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor.

His portrayal is genuine, and at no moment does it feel melodramatic and forced. The majority of his scenes are separate from the lead actors and for the most part it feels like The Impossible is Holland's film\" (Entertainment Maven); \"Mr. Holland, meanwhile, matures before our eyes, navigating the passage from adolescent self-absorption to profound and terrible responsibility. He is a terrific young actor\" (New York Times).\nTom has given a number of interviews about his role in The Impossible. In particular, he talked on video to Vanity Fair Senior West Coast editor Krista Smith and with IAMROGUE's Managing Editor Jami Philbrick. He has also given interviews to The Hollywood Reporter, to the MovieWeb, to Today Show on NBC and to other outlets. Tom's director and co-stars have also talked about him. Juan Antonio Bayona: \"He had this extraordinary ability to get into the emotion and portray it in a very, very easy way. The best I'd ever seen in a kid.\" Ewan McGregor: \"It was wonderful watching Tom who had never worked in front of a camera before, to see him really get it and grow as a film actor as he went along. He's really talented and polite to everyone. It's very easy for children to lose perspective but he's absolutely on the right road and a brilliant actor.\" Naomi Watts: \"He has an incredible emotional instrument and an unbelievable sense of himself... Tom Holland and I had a couple of moments where we came together and I could just tell how wonderful he was and what a beautiful instrument he had. It was just easy to work with him, that was one of the greatest highlights for me: discovering a friendship with Tom off-screen and this beautiful relationship between mother and son on-screen. The intimacy that develops through the course of the film between Lucas and Maria, I just loved that relationship. I mean, Tom is a beyond gifted actor. He's just a raw, open talent that is just so easy to work with. And Tom, he's inspiring, he kind of lifts everyone's game around him because he can do nothing but tell the truth. He was great.\"\nIn his turn, Tom Holland has returned favours to Naomi Watts when he was asked to present Desert Palm Achievement Award to her at Palm Springs International Film Festival. According to HitFix: \"One recurring theme of the night was how the introductions were often better than actual winner's speeches... The best intro, however, had to go to 16-year-old Tom Holland who intro'd his \"Impossible\" co-star Watts. Holland admitted of all of Watts' great performances his dad had only let him see \"King Kong\" and while they spent six weeks shooting in a water tank he didn't know it was \"difficult\" because he actually \"loved it\"... Most important, this was Holland's first film role and he sweetly noted, \"From the moment I met you, you took my hand and you never let go.\" Cue the \"awwww\" from the audience.\" The presentation is available on video.\nIn 2011, Holland was cast in British version of the animation film Arrietty, produced by Japan's cult Studio Ghibli.

Area Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the \"Best Youth Performance\" category; for the London Film Critics Circle Awards 2012 in the \"Young British Performer of the Year\" category.\nKristopher Tapley, Editor-at-Large of HitFix, reported on 27 August 2012 that Summit Entertainment, the company responsible for distribution of The Impossible in USA, would be campaigning Holland rather than McGregor as the lead, and strongly argued that Tom Holland deserved to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Actor category. The fact of long-listing for an Academy Award was confirmed in the article in the Hollywood Reporter: \"And though McGregor stars as his father in the film, Holland has been submitted as the lead actor for awards consideration. Regardless if he receives any nominations, his performance as the strong-willed and determined eldest son is garnering critical acclaim.\"\nAs one of the most promising young actors, Holland was featured in Screen International's \"UK Stars of Tomorrow - 2012\" and in Variety's \"Youth Impact Report 2012\".

Getting his start in television, including\nThe Henderson Kids (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086727/?ls)\nand the long running soap opera\nNeighbours (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088580/?ls)\n, Mendelsohn broke out with his performance as an ill-fated juvenile delinquent in the acclaimed coming of age film\nThe Year My Voice Broke (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094347/?ls)\n. Mendelsohn won the best supporting actor award from the Australian Film Institute, his first of eight nominations.\nMendelsohn went onto to become one of the most popular teen/young adult stars in Australia cinema, often rivaling other emerging talents of his generation, including\nRussell Crowe (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000128/?ls)\n,\nNoah Taylor (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852965/?ls)\n, and\nGuy Pearce (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001602/?ls)\n, leading the Australian tabloid to nickname them \"the Mouse Pack\" in reference to the Rat Pack in America and Brit Pack in the UK, emerging at the same time. Among his peers, Mendelsohn seemed to corner the market on troubled, angry young men, thanks to his roles in\nIdiot Box (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116604/?ls)\n,\nMetal Skin (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110500/?ls)\n, and\nNirvana Street Murder (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102539/?ls)\n.

The film failed to find an audience and Mendelsohn returned to Australia, where he primarily worked in theater and television, despite earning best actor nominations from the Australian Film Institute and Australian Film Critics Circle for the drama Mullet, as a prodigal son returning to his small town. He also took steps to work in more international films such as\nThe New World (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402399/?ls)\n,\nKnowing (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448011/?ls)\nand\nAustralia (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455824/?ls)\n. Mendelsohn has acknowledged that there was a period of almost two years that he had so little work, he considered leaving the acting profession entirely.\nIn 2009, Mendelsohn experienced a bit of a comeback with the role in the independent Australian films\nBeautiful Kate (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1209377/?ls)\n, as troubled man forced to reunite with his dying father and come to terms with the death of his twin sister, with whom he had a complicated relationship. He was nominated for Australian Film Institute and Australian Film Critics Circle Best Actor in 2009. A year later, he appeared as Pope in\nAnimal Kingdom (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1313092/?ls)\n, the most terrifying and violent member of a crime family. In 2010, he won Best Actor from the Australian Film Institute, Independent Film Award, and Australian Film Critics Circle.\nSince 2010, Mendelsohn has become a major player in Hollywood as a character actor in both blockbuster films (\nThe Dark Knight Rises (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345836/?ls)\n) and critically acclaimed films such as\nKilling Them Softly (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764234/?ls)\nand\nThe Place Beyond the Pines (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1817273/?ls)\n. In 2013 he appeared in the UK\nStarred Up (2013) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2567712/?ls)\n, which earned him a Best Supporting Actor Award from the British Independent Film Awards. He received high praise for his performance as gambling addict in 2015's\nMississippi Grind (2015) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2349144/?ls)\n(earning an independent spirit award nomination for best actor). The same year he began a two season run on Netflix's\nBloodline (2015) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3520702/?ls)\nas Danny Rayburn, the black sheep in a well respected family in the Florida Keys (he was considered a guest actor in the third and final season).

He grew up in Barnes, southwest London with two older sisters. Robert discovered his love for music long before acting and started learning the guitar and piano at the age of four. He became a big cinephile for love of auteur cinema in his early teens and preferred to watch films rather than doing his homework. In his late teens and early twenties, he used to perform solo acoustic guitar gigs at open mic nights in bars and pubs around London where he sung his own written songs. Thinking about becoming a musician or going to university to study speech-writing, he never thought about pursuing an acting career and his drama teacher in school even advised him not to join the drama club because she thought he wasn't made for the creative subjects. But as a teenager, he joined the local amateur theatre club after his father convinced him to attend because he was quite shy. At age 15 and after two years of working backstage, he auditioned for the play 'Guys and Dolls' and he got his first role as a Cuban dancer with no lines. He got the lead part in the next play 'Our Town', was spotted by a talent agent who was sitting in the audience and he began looking for professional roles.\nHis first screen role was a small part in\nVanity Fair (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241025/?ls)\n, but he'd been cut out of the final film and didn't know about it until he attended the premiere. The casting director felt so guilty for not telling him, that she got him the audition for\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330373/?ls)\n. He was lucky and succeeded in gaining the role of Cedric Diggory, which brought him to a wider audience at the age of 19 and he continued to star in mostly smaller British TV productions. Hollywood expressed only mild interest in him and he was still debating whether or not he wished to pursue acting. Throughout that period, Pattinson would occasionally send audition tapes for roles in America. One, for a rom-com, led to the opportunity for an in-person audition in Los Angeles. That audition did not pan out, but while in town he went in for another, with\nThirteen (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328538/?ls)\ndirector\nCatherine Hardwicke (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0362566/?ls)\n, for a part in what he understood to be an indie movie based on a low-profile book about a vampire. Being the last one out of 3000 male actors to audition for the part, the role of Edward Cullen in the film adaptations of the Twilight novels written by Stephenie Meyer brought him to unexpected worldwide stardom at age 22 and the five films between 2008 and 2012 grossed over $3.3 billion in worldwide receipts. Between the Twilight Saga films, he also starred in\nRemember Me (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1403981/?ls)\n,\nWater for Elephants (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1067583/?ls)\nand\nBel Ami (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440732/?ls)\n.\nPattinson's Twilight-era was surreal. He had been catapulted onto Hollywood's A-list as a heartthrob, but also experienced certain preconceptions about what he wanted - or was capable of doing - as an actor. That changed with an unexpected straight offer from auteur director\nDavid Cronenberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000343/?ls)\nto star in\nCosmopolis (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1480656/?ls)\n, which he described as an eye-opening experience: It reminded him of his love for cinema, why he wanted to become an actor in the first place and solidified his foremost desire for the coming years to work with great filmmakers. With Pattinson being a big cinephile, he since then starred in mostly independent films from respected auteur directors, such as\nThe Rover (2014) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2345737/?ls)\n,\nMaps to the Stars (2014) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2172584/?ls)\n,\nLife (2015) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948840/?ls)\n,\nQueen of the Desert (2015) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1837636/?ls)\nand\nThe Childhood of a Leader (2015) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2815902/?ls)\n. His unrecognizable role as an explorer in the amazon jungle in\nThe Lost City of Z (2016) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1212428/?ls)\nfrom director\nJames Gray (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0336695/?ls)\nbrought him much critical acclaim. His transformation to a sleazy, manic conman in the gritty crime thriller\nGood Time (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846232/?ls)\nearned a six-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and brought him a nomination for Best Actor at the Independent Spirit Awards. It was a major step for his transition into a character actor with incredible range, with critics calling his performance a revelation and career-defining. He starred in the western-comedy\nDamsel (2018) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5881528/?ls)\nas a cowboy with sociopathic characteristics and played a convict sent to space for sexual experimentation in the psychological mystery drama\nHigh Life (2018) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4827558/?ls)\nfrom acclaimed French auteur director\nClaire Denis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219136/?ls)\n.

He began his acting career at the age of eight and continued working in films and on Swedish\ntelevision until he turned sixteen and decided acting was not the career for him. Life under a microscope lost its charm and perhaps due\nto the influence of\nMy Skarsgård (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0803891/?ls)\n, his physician mother, he stopped working as an actor, to continue his education.\nInstead of continuing college, at the age of nineteen, he entered compulsory military service (military conscription). He used the time to contemplate his future. He studied at the Leeds Metropolitan University then moved to New York where he enrolled at Marymount Manhattan College to study theatre. After six months in New York, a romantic entanglement lured him back to Sweden but the relationship was short-lived. Despite having a broken heart, Alexander decided to stay in Sweden and, with a bit of life experience under his belt, began his acting career again. He appeared in a number of Swedish productions and became a star in his native country but was interested in broadening his horizons and working outside of Sweden.

Alexander spent seven months broiling in the desert of Namibia but it was well worth it. His portrayal of Marine Sgt. Brad \"Iceman\" Colbert astonished critics and audiences, alike. Thanks to the writer's strike, after completing\nGeneration Kill (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995832/?ls)\n, he was cast in the role of \"Eric Northman\", a 1,000-year-old Viking vampire on the hit series,\nTrue Blood (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844441/?ls)\n.

They have two children.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0390903/?ref_=ls_i_70)\n70. Tom Hollander (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0390903/?ref_=ls_t_70)\nActor\nProducer\nWriter\nPride & Prejudice (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414387/?ref_=ls_knf_70)\nTom Hollander was born the\nsecond child of educated parents, both teachers. He grew up in Oxford,\n(UK).\nHollander credits the happy atmosphere of the Dragon School with his\nchildhood introduction to acting. There, encouraged by an influential\nteacher named Andrew Roberts, he won the title role in \"Oliver\". His\nstudies continued at Abingdon, as did his pursuit of acting. At about\nthis point, he won a place in the National Youth Theatre, a UK\norganization for young people in the field of musical theatre, based in\nLondon, and later at the Children's Music Theatre. It was during CMT's\n\"The Leaving of Liverpool\" (1981) that he came to the attention of BBC\ntelevision, and subsequently found himself front and center as the\nyoung protagonist in a well-regarded\nJohn Diamond (1981) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399225/?ls)\n, based\non the popular Leon Garfield adventure novel. He was just fourteen\nyears old.\nOther early projects included two roles in Bertholt Brecht's \"The\nCaucasian Chalk Circle\" (1985) for the National Youth Theatre, and \"A\nMidsummer Night's Dream\" for Oxford University Dramatic Society.\nHollander attended Cambridge University at about the same time as his\nchildhood friend\nSam Mendes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005222/?ls)\nin a\nvisually bold (and well-remembered) staging of \"Cyrano de Bergerac\"\n(1988). Other collaborations with Mendes have followed, including work\nat the West End production of \"The Cherry Orchard\" (1989, with\nJudi Dench (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001132/?ls)\n), and the Chichester Festival\nTheatre (1989) as well as a Toronto staging of \"Kean\" (1991) with\nDerek Jacobi (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001394/?ls)\n. He also appeared in the\nCambridge Footlights Revue (1988).\nUpon graduation, Hollander hoped to gain entry to drama school, but\nfound himself disappointed. The oversight did nothing to discourage a\nsuccessful career already well under way: he garnered an Ian Charleson\nAward for his turn as Witwould in \"The Way of the World\" (1992), was\nnominated again for a \"splendidly sinister, manic\" performance as\n\"Tartuffe\" (1996), and yet again as a finalist for his Khlestakov (\"a\nperformance of ideal vigour and impudence\"), in Gogol's \"The Government\nInspector\" (1997). Inevitably, Hollander was urged to try films, and\nappeared in two films as early as 1996.\nTrue Blue (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117973/?ls)\n(aka \"Miracle at\nOxford\") found him in a small but memorable role as the cox for\nOxford's noted 1987 \"mutiny crew\" that went on to win the that year's\nboat race against Cambridge, and in a thankless role in\nSome Mother's Son (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117690/?ls)\n, a\nsober drama about an IRA gunman, playing a Thatcher representative.\nHollander's career has featured a number of memorable gay roles. His\nfans are especially fond of the larger-than-life Darren from\nBedrooms and Hallways (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126810/?ls)\n,\na romantic comedy with what one reviewer called the \"funniest bedroom\nscene of the year\" involving Hollander's character and\nHugo Weaving (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915989/?ls)\n. The over-the-top Darren was\nso convincing that some viewers assumed Hollander was gay. \"Sometimes I\ncall myself a professional homosexual impersonator,\" he told an\ninterviewer at the time, quickly adding, \"you could say that ...Sir Ian\nMcKellen and Rock Hudson do straight actors.\" The following year, he\nwould take on a very different kind of \"gay\" role, playing the\nnotorious \"Bosie\" (Lord Alfred Douglas) against\nLiam Neeson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000553/?ls)\n's Oscar Wilde in \"The Judas\nKiss\" (1998).\n\"Martha -- Meet Frank Daniel and Laurence\" (aka\nThe Very Thought of You (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120747/?ls)\n,\nwith\nJoseph Fiennes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001212/?ls)\nand\nRufus Sewell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001722/?ls)\n, brought accolades for his\nstandout role as Daniel, a difficult music executive. Variety,\nimpressed, noted him for \"U.K. legit work\" and called him the\n\"undisputed hit of the pic\".\n2001 brought\nGosford Park (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280707/?ls)\n,\nRobert Altman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000265/?ls)\n's masterfully\nstylized murder mystery, in which he played the quietly desperate\nAnthony Meredith against\nMichael Gambon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002091/?ls)\n's\ncallously indifferent paterfamilias. Hollander's name figures in a half\ndozen or more \"Best Ensemble\" awards for this complex, multi-storied\nfilm.\nConsidered the character-actor-of-choice for roles with comedic\nqualities, Hollander has challenged assumptions about his capacity by\ntaking on difficult, troubled characters such as the tightly-wound King\nGeorge V in Stephen Poliakoff's\nThe Lost Prince (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349747/?ls)\nfor BBC and the demented fascist dictator Maximillian II in\nLand of the Blind (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433405/?ls)\n.\nHollander himself is particularly proud of the film\nLawless Heart (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276276/?ls)\n, a slyly\nhumorous, cleverly constructed comedy-drama told from three viewpoints.\nHollander's character, the heart of the film, is a decent man,\ndevastated by the death of his partner, and grieving privately as the\nstories of friends and family unfold around him. A study of desire,\nloyalty and courage, the film was very well reviewed and much\nrespected.\nMore recent film work has brought him to the attention of mainstream\nmovie audiences, who now know him as the magnificently petty tyrant\nLord Cutler Beckett in the second and third installments of Disney's\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies,\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383574/?ls)\nand\nPirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449088/?ls)\n.\nThis role brought another kind of achievement: Hollander could now say\nthat he'd been commemorated in collectible action-figure form.\nHe's worked three times with director\nJoe Wright (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942504/?ls)\n, beginning with the\nprissy, yet strangely likeable Mr. Collins in\nPride & Prejudice (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414387/?ls)\n, as a\nclueless classical cellist in an unfortunately truncated role in\nThe Soloist (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821642/?ls)\n, and as Issacs,\nthe German henchman in\nHanna (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993842/?ls)\n.\nWith\nIn the Loop (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226774/?ls)\n, Hollander\nbrought a perfectly unbearable, delicate tension to the role of Simon\nFoster, the earnestly clueless \"British Secretary of State for\nInternational Development\" who says the wrong thing at exactly the\nwrong moment. The film acted as a kind of companion piece to the\ncritically-acclaimed\nThe Thick of It (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459159/?ls)\non\nBBC2, Armando Iannucci's furious political satire on the machinations\nof war and media. Hollander's contribution to the expanded story was\napparently so well-received he was \"brought back\" (but in a different\nrole, entirely) from film to television for a series-ending\nsurprise-appearance in series 3, delighting fans of the show.\nRecent work in television has brought him the opportunity to expand on\nhis special capacity for conveying nuanced and contradictory\ncharacters. He earned an award for Best Actor at the FIPA International\nTelevision Festival for his portrayal of Guy Burgess in\nCambridge Spies (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346223/?ls)\n, and\nearned praise for the monstrously rude yet oddly endearing Leon in the\nsatire\nFreezing (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1151072/?ls)\n, with\nHugh Bonneville (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0095017/?ls)\nand\nElizabeth McGovern (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001527/?ls)\n) for BBC.\nHe was unforgettable in an elegantly brief but very moving portrayal of\nKing George III for HBO's\nJohn Adams (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472027/?ls)\n.\n2010 brought Hollander to widespread attention with\nRev. (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588221/?ls)\n, which he co-created with\nJames Wood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1198822/?ls)\n. The show, initially\ndescribed in what was assumed to be familiar terms (\"vicar\", \"comedy\")\nbecame something entirely new: \"...an exploration of British hypocrisy\nand a warmly played character piece\", wrote Giles Fraser, Canon\nChancellor at St Paul's Cathedral in a piece for The Sunday Telegraph.\nRev. was much more than it appeared: reviews called it intelligent,\nrealistic and very funny, with a stellar cast headed by Hollander as\nthe sympathetic and very human vicar, Adam Smallbone. The show would\ngarner a BAFTA in 2011 for Best Situation Comedy, among other awards\nand recognition.\nHollander supports a variety of charitable causes in innovative ways.\nIn 2006 he ran his first race for the Childline Crisis hotline, and in\n2007 ran for the Teenage Cancer Trust. He is a long-time supporter of\nthe Helen and Douglas House in Oxford, which provides Hospice care for\nchildren, and continues to support charitable organizations by\ncontributing readings and other appearances throughout the year.\nHollander is a patron of BIFA, the British Independent Film Awards, and\nhas supported the efforts of the Old Vic's \"24 Hour Plays New Voices\"\nGala, which forwards the cause of young writers for the British stage.\nHollander continues to diversify with voicework roles in radio, reading\naudiobooks, doing voiceover work and onstage. He appeared in the Old\nVic's production of Georges Feydeau's \"A Flea in Her Ear\" (2010),\nplaying a demanding dual role: the upstanding Victor Emmanuel\nChandebise and the lame-brained Poche. Reviews called it \"insanity\",\nand his performance \"a breathtaking combination of lightning physical\nprecision and shockingly true confusion\".\nHollander is in production for series 2 of the winning comedy\nRev. (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588221/?ls)\n.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7887725/?ref_=ls_i_71)\n71. Fionn Whitehead (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7887725/?ref_=ls_t_71)\nActor\nSoundtrack\nDunkirk (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/?ref_=ls_knf_71)\nFrom a family of Londoners, Fionn Whitehead was born and raised in Richmond upon Thames, Surrey (southwest England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London). He is the son of Tim and Linda Whitehead, and has three older siblings: sisters Maisie and Hattie, and brother Sonny. Maisie, the eldest of the four, is a dancer and an Aerialist-Yoga enthusiast, while Hattie is a folk artist who has released a folk album.\nNamed after Irish folk legend Fionn mac Cumhaill, Whitehead grew up in an artistic environment, much due to the fact that his father, Tim Whitehead, is an acclaimed British jazz musician who, having a law degree from Manchester University, decided to pursue music instead. He had a long and varied career as a jazz composer, performer and teacher. Tim has played extensively throughout the UK and Europe, and more recently in the USA with American pianist Phil DeGreg. In the '70s, he toured with Ian Carr's Nucleus and Graham Collier Music, and won the Young Jazz Musicians of the Year Award with his own band, South of the Border, in 1977.\nFionn began acting at the Orange Tree Theatre when he was thirteen years old, then went to Orleans Park School where he was among of the top lads, awarded 12 passes at A* or A. Upon finishing school Fionn went to Richmond College and entered the National Youth Theatre's summer course.\nBy 2015, he was an aspiring actor who worked at a coffee shop in Waterloo, London. He starred in the 2016 British miniseries the ITV three-part series HIM while continuing to be an active member of the Youth Theatre. He also acted in a stage performance of Glenn Waldron's Natives and is one of Screen International's Stars of Tomorrow 2016.\nThe year 2017 marked big for Fionn Whitehead, as the 19-year-old (Born in 1997) English actor was cast as the lead for Christopher Nolan's British historical epic Dunkirk alongside many of his well established all country mates. Nolan compared Whitehead to \"a young\" Tom Courtenay. In 2017 Fionn will star as the lead role in Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk and has just finished shooting the young lead in the feature The Children Act opposite actress Emma Thompson and actor Stanley Tucci.\nHe is represented by the Curtis Brown Agency and according to Deadline, Whitehead has signed with UTA for agency representation by Curtis Brown and Peikoff Mahan.\nMore to explore\nFeedback\nTell us what you think about this feature.

(1991) and Great Performances (1971). He has been married to Jill Biden since June 17, 1977. They have one child. He was previously married to Neilia Biden.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874339/?ref_=ls_i_2)\n2. Donald Trump (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874339/?ref_=ls_t_2)\nProducer\nActor\nWriter\nThe Apprentice (2004–2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364782/?ref_=ls_knf_2)\nThe Trump family were German immigrants. Donald Trump's father became a multi-millionaire by building tenements in the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. After graduating from high school, Donald Trump studied economics at Fordham University and graduated from University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He gained his first professional experience in his father's company, and in 1974 he set up his own business in Manhattan. In 1975, Trump bought the old Commodore Hotel in New York and five years later he opened the Grand Hyatt Hotel New York. Donald quickly became known for his willingness to take risks. Trump quickly built up a considerable fortune through real estate in New York. In 1977 he married Ivana Trump. The marriage produced sons Donald Jr. (1977) and Eric (1984) and daughter Ivanka (1981). The divorce took place in 1992. In the 1980s, Trump divided his business areas into real estate, gaming, hotels and residential and commercial buildings, which were reunited under the umbrella of a holding company.\nTrump achieved international popularity in 1983 with the construction of the \"Trump Tower\" on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The building is 202 meters high and has 58 floors. Like John D. Rockefeller, Trump created a monument to his wealth in New York. In 1989, Donald Trump acquired the American airline Eastern Airlines, which he renamed as \"Trump Shuttle\" after the purchase. However, following poor operating figures, the company was sold again after three years. In 1990, Trump opened a gigantic hotel-casino called \"Trump - Taj Mahal\" in Atlantic City near New York. However, the construction resulted in unexpectedly high expenses. In total, commitments totaling around $3 billion were outstanding from other projects. This meant that Trump and his corporate empire were on the verge of ruin in the early 1990s. After negotiations with investors and banks, Donald Trump managed to reorganize his obligations and thus made a comeback as a major investor. He was married to Marla Maple from 1993 to 1999.\nIn 1998, the \"Trump - International Hotel and Tower\" was inaugurated at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. In addition to rental income from the Trump Tower and other exclusive commercial buildings, various casinos in New Jersey and Florida as well as large leisure centers were now also among the empire's sources of income. All facilities and business areas had Trump's name in their logo. Based on ever new gigantic construction projects, one could only speculate about his wealth. Trump owned around ten office and residential towers in excellent locations in New York alone. In 2001, Trump completed the \"Trump World Tower\" in New York. The extremely sophisticated residential and commercial high-rise in Manhattan Midtown is 262 meters high and has 72 floors. From 2003 to 2004 and 2004 to 2005, he appeared on the US television show \"The Apprentice\", in which he sought employees for his corporate empire.\nTwo years after the decision to redevelop \"Ground Zero,\" Trump came forward with a counterproposal in 2005. Instead of Daniel Libeskind's planned \"Freedom Tower,\" Trump wanted to resurrect the destroyed twin towers of the World Trade Center. The plans of the American star architect of Japanese origin Minoru Yamasaki served as a template. Trump married Melania Knauss, 28 years his junior, on January 22, 2005. Their son Barron William was born in 2006. In 2007 he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On June 16, 2015, Trump announced that he would run in the Republican primary as a candidate for the US presidential election in November 2016. In the first primary in the state of New Hampshire on February 9, 2016, Trump was able to clearly assert himself. He already had an absolute majority in May - thanks above all to his election slogan: \"Make America great again\". On July 19, 2016, Trump was officially elected as the presidential candidate at the Republican nomination convention in Cleveland. He formally accepted the election on July 21, 2016.\nOn November 8, 2016, Donald Trump won the US presidential election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. His inauguration in Washington D.C. was set for January 20, 2017 in accordance with the constitution. As President of the United States, Donald Trump pursued a rigorous government policy in all matters right from the start - according to the election motto: \"American first\", which earned him many votes. Not only was and is directly affected by the international trade community, but also US citizens with a migrant background and migrants who want to come to America.\nIn 2019, the American president recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, thereby single-handedly bringing about a momentous paradigm shift in international Middle East policy - which was undesirable by many politically involved. In the same year, 2019, he refused to sign the UN arms trade treaty ATT (Arms Trade Treaty), which has regulated international standards for the trade in conventional weapons since 2014. In addition, Trump's presidency was shaken by, among other things, the Russia affair and the Ukraine affair, which brought him impeachment proceedings, which he survived thanks to the Republican majority in the Senate. The US head of government is shaping a new style of government with his extensive use of the news medium \"Twitter\" by repeatedly disseminating important government announcements and personal opinions there. He continually describes his poor relationship with the public press with the catchphrase \"fake news\" that he has made popular, and which often catches up with his critics. Trump won the 2024 Republican nomination for president, initially campaigning against incumbent Joe Biden. However, when Biden dropped his campaign, Kamala Harris was selected to run in Biden's stead. Trump defeated Harris with both a majority and electoral win to become the 47th president. He will be only the second president to have a non-consecutive second term in office (after President Grover Cleveland).\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1682433/?ref_=ls_i_3)\n3.

His mother, Stanley\nAnn Dunham (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5023778/?ls)\n, was a white American from Wichita, Kansas. His father,\nBarack Obama Sr. (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3381194/?ls)\n, who was black, was from Alego, Kenya. They were both young college students at the University of Hawaii. When his father left for Harvard, his mother and Barack stayed behind, and his father ultimately returned alone to Kenya, where he worked as a government economist. Barack's mother remarried an Indonesian oil manager and moved to Jakarta when Barack was six. He later recounted Indonesia as simultaneously lush and a harrowing exposure to tropical poverty. He returned to Hawaii, where he was brought up largely by his grandparents. The family lived in a small apartment - his grandfather was a furniture salesman and an unsuccessful insurance agent and his grandmother worked in a bank - but Barack managed to get into Punahou School, Hawaii's top prep academy. His father wrote to him regularly but, though he traveled around the world on official business for Kenya, he visited only once, when Barack was ten. Obama attended Columbia University, but found New York's racial tension inescapable. He became a community organizer for a small Chicago church-based group for three years, helping poor South Side residents cope with a wave of plant closings. He then attended Harvard Law School, and in 1990 became the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review. He turned down a prestigious judicial clerkship, choosing instead to practice civil-rights law back in Chicago, representing victims of housing and employment discrimination and working on voting-rights legislation. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago Law School, and married Michelle Robinson (now\nMichelle Obama (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2349292/?ls)\n, a fellow attorney; their daughters are\nSasha Obama (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3127877/?ls)\nand\nMalia Obama (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3078497/?ls)\n. Eventually, he was elected to the Illinois state senate, where his district included both Hyde Park and some of the poorest ghettos on the South Side. In 2004, Obama was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, representing Illinois, and he gained national attention by giving a rousing and well-received keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. In 2008 he ran for President, and despite having only four years of national political experience, he won. In January 2009, he was sworn in as the 44th President of the United States, and the first African-American ever elected to that position. Obama was re-elected to a second term in November 2012 - and was sworn in in January 2013.

Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124133/?ref_=ls_t_4)\nCamera and Electrical Department\nAdditional Crew\nSoundtrack\nJourneys with George (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312848/?ref_=ls_knf_4)\nThe 43rd President of the United States of America, George Walker Bush (known colloquially as \"W\" to distinguish himself from his father,\nGeorge Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124132/?ls)\n, the 41st president of the U.S.), was born two days after the national holiday of the Fourth of July, 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut. There, his father was attending Yale College in the Class of 1949. His mother was\nBarbara Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124093/?ls)\n(the former Barbara Pierce), whom his father had married on January 6, 1945. \"W\" was their first child. Bush disliked being called \"Junior\" or Bush II, or even having the term \"Jr.\" abbreviated next to his name.\nInitially, W's prospects of living up to his illustrious pedigree were dim. Possibly hobbled by dyslexia (a condition little understood and seldom treated during his childhood), Bush proved an uninspired student in high school. He did maintain a gentlemanly \"C+\" average at Yale and acquired a Masters of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School, but until he turned 40, he seemed to be floundering. He admittedly had a drinking problem in his youth, but a late marriage to Laura Welch helped stabilize him. His rebirth as a believing Christian (he is a Methodist whereas his parents were Episcopalian) in 1986 helped put him on the straight and narrow path that led him to the Presidency.\nBush has been discounted many times in his life and career for being wooden and unintelligent due to his fractured speaking style, but in fact, his academic performance was on par if not slightly better than that of his better-spoken, fellow Yalie\nJohn Kerry (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449902/?ls)\n. As Bush's test scores and subsequent achievements suggest an above average intelligence, it is appropriate to believe that he likely has benefited from other's underestimation of his gifts. This was apparent in the first televised debate with\nAl Gore (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330722/?ls)\nin 2000, when Bush held his own against the condescending vice president, and in doing so, triumphed in the eyes of the political handicappers.\nAfter W. turned his life around in the late 1980s, he began achieving success on his own, though that success inevitably was indebted to his social position and his father's business and political connections, particularly after he himself ascended to the Presidency after the expiration of\nRonald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ls)\n's second term. The first President Bush (Bush 41, as he is colloquially known) had great connections in the Middle East, particularly with the Saudi royal family and the powerful Bin Laden clan. Using his father's Saudi connections, Bush Jr. became a millionaire twice over through Middle Eastern oil projects. His most notable achievement in private life was in becoming president and chief operating partner of the Texas Rangers professional baseball team, which was financially invigorated by the building of a new stadium with taxpayers' funds. For a man whose greatest ambition was not the presidency but to be baseball commissioner, the \"job\" of Rangers owner suited him just fine, and his stint as the amiable owner of the team helped generate good publicity that wiped out his past image as a playboy. When he cashed out his ownership stake, Bush had a $14 million profit. More importantly, ownership of the Rangers positioned him financially and in the public eye for a successful run for the governorship of Texas, which proved to be his springboard to the presidency.\nUnder the quirky Texas constitution, the governor of Texas is primarily a ceremonial position, somewhat akin to that of the president in a Parliamentary system. The true political power in Texas lies with the lieutenant governor, who acts as a prime minister (or provincial premier in Canada) in that that he/she runs the legislature. In a life characterized by luck, the capricious Bush was luckier still in that he was told by the lieutenant governor, a Democrat, that he would make Bush a great governor if he would let him. Bush did and established an enviable reputation, one that crossed both party lines in Texas, where it would have been futile for the governor to act in a partisan fashion.\nWith his father's Eastern Establishment credentials that linked him to the \"Rockefeller Republicans\" (conservative on financial matters, liberal on social issues) and his mother's own noted social liberalism, Bush was seen as being a moderate with a difference. That difference was his connections to the powerful evangelical Christian wing of the Republican Party, due to his own rebirth as a believing Christian and his immersion in day-to-day Texas politics. In the Sun Belt, fundamentalists and evangelicals were considered ordinary, run-of-the-day folk, not the exotics that Washington and the Eastern Establishment looked at them as.\nWith a foot in both wings of the party, Bush was seen as a natural candidate for president after\nBob Dole (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230909/?ls)\n's dolorous 1996 candidacy. That he was a \"straight shooter\" with no scandal attached to him since his misbegotten youth (which he had confessed to and had put behind him) made him attractive to the Republicans, who had tried to terminate William Jefferson Clinton's presidency through impeachment due to his lies linked to his \"bimbo eruptions.\" Bush seemed like a \"Man for All Seasons\" that would be the GOP's best shot of unseating the Clintonistas as represented by Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election.\nWith the Republican Establishment firmly behind him as a kind of \"Great White Hope\" of the Grand Old Party, Bush managed to wrap up the nomination easily, after stumbling initially when confronted with the candidacy of the renegade Republican senator from Arizona,\nJohn McCain (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564587/?ls)\n. Although viewed by most Republicans as a RINO (Republican in name only), McCain dominated the early primaries in states that allowed cross over voting by attracting middle-of-the-road independents and conservative Democrats, but stumbled himself when the primary season headed South. He was badly defeated by Bush in South Carolina, a deeply conservative state that had voted for favorite son (and segregationist)\nStrom Thurmond (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2493440/?ls)\nin 1948, uber-conservative\nBarry Goldwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326400/?ls)\nin 1964, and segregationist\nGeorge Wallace (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908650/?ls)\nin 1968. McCain also was victimized by smear tactics, such as the whispering campaign started by Mississippi Senator\nTrent Lott (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1711619/?ls)\nthat claimed the renegade McCain had been mentally discombobulated by his seven years as a POW in Vietnam. The dirty tricks used against McCain by Bush campaign manager/major domo\nKarl Rove (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1311211/?ls)\nwould prove to be harbingers of the paranoid style of politics that would come to fruition during Bush's first term.\nMcCain, a maverick senator with the support of many moderate Republicans and Independents as well as a following among conservative Democrats, was not only smeared, but his attempts to get on the ballot in such states as New York were stymied until the federal courts stepped in. (In 2004, even though he endorsed Bush against Kerry, McCain found himself smeared again by elements connected with Karl Rove when he defended Kerry's war record and patriotism.) The Republican Establishment were determined to give the nomination to a true blue Republican who could win (the color red was not associated with the GOP until Election Night 2000, when it was used as the map color for the Party after a century wherein the Republicans were blue and the Democrats red). After his defeat of McCain in South Carolina, Bush had as easy a time wrapping up the nomination as if he had been an incumbent.\nAt the beginning of the fall campaign, what with the U.S. still enjoying the tail end of almost eight years of prosperity under President\nBill Clinton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001051/?ls)\n, his vice president, Al Gore, started out as a prohibitive favorite to win the presidency. Gore, whoever, turned out to be unable to shed his past reputation as an uninspiring campaigner, and failed to fire up the uncommitted. Bush, on the other hand, a relative unknown commodity who had enjoyed good press for the past decade as a baseball owner and governor, did not make many errors after appearing at Bob Jones University several weeks after it had banned interracial dating during the early Republican primaries (for which he apologized). He capitalized on the low expectations others had for him, and won respect - and votes - for going the distance without stumbling or embarrassing himself, while Gore had to live down the bimbo eruptions of his past running mate and his own faux pas, such as his claim to have invented the \"Information Superhighway\" (Internet). His stiff, \"Wooden Indian\" style came off as pompous on the campaign trail, giving Bush's persona a boost as it could have been portrayed as bumbling if he had been up against a natural born campaigner such as Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan.\nIn the game of politics as played in the US, Gore had everything to lose and Bush had everything to gain. Gore had to rise and exceed expectations while Bush merely had to live up to lowered expectations to rise above them and gain credence, and he did, beginning with the first debate. Going into the first debate, pundits expected the better-spoken Gore to eviscerate the syntactically challenged Bush (whose intelligence they disparaged), but it did not happen. Gore was haughty, and since Bush held his own, the governor of Texas was adjudged the winner. From there to the end of the campaign, Gore could never consolidate his early lead, which slipped away.\nOn election day, Bush and Gore were locked in a dead heat. In the closest election in a century, it all came down to a matter of 537 votes in Florida. Out of the nearly six million votes cast in the Sunshine State (5,861,785 total, with 36,742 won by third party candidates), Bush was certified as the winner, with a margin representing 0.0087%, less than nine one-thousandths of a percentage point.\nAfter a long drawn-out process involving recounts and court challenges, Bush took the oath of office on January 20, 2001 and won re-election in November 2004 to become the first son of a president to win two terms in office.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001051/?ref_=ls_i_5)\n5.

His mother then moved to New Orleans. Bill Clinton initially grew up with his grandparents. In 1950 his mother returned to Hope. That same year she married car dealer Roger Clinton. As a member of a student delegation from the patriotic American Legion, Clinton met in Washington D.C. with President John F. Kennedy. Clinton was interested in politics from a young age. After graduating from high school, he studied international relations at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. until 1968. He then studied law at Yale and Oxford Universities on a scholarship until 1973. During his studies, Clinton was already involved in various student organizations. He played saxophone in a jazz band and supported himself as a staffer in the office of Senator J. William Fulbright. In 1968, Clinton received a \"Rhodes Scholarship\" that allowed him to travel to the University of Oxford, England.\nFrom 1970 he studied law at Yale University. After receiving his doctorate in 1973, he briefly worked for the House Judiciary Committee. From 1973 to 1976 he was appointed to the University of Arkansas School of Law. In 1974 he ran for a seat in the House of Representatives, but was narrowly defeated by the Republican incumbent John-Paul Hammerschmidt. In 1975, Bill Clinton married Hillary Rodham, Hillary Clinton. In 1976, Clinton was elected to the office of Attorney General of Arkansas. Two years later, in 1978, at just 32 years old, he was appointed governor of Arkansas, the youngest head of government of an American state at the time. After two years he resigned from the senatorial office. His daughter Chelsea was born in 1980. From 1980 to 1983, Bill Clinton worked at the law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings in Little Rock. At the end of 1983 he was re-elected as governor of Arkansas. In 1985 he became a co-founder of the \"Democratic Leadership Council\" and from 1990 its chairman.\nFrom 1986 to 1987, Clinton served as chairman of the National Governors Association. In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president. In July 1991 he was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate. Senator Al Gore, who was running for vice-presidency, went into the election campaign with him. Throughout the entire election campaign, Bill Clinton was in the lead by a clear margin, not least because of his successful connection to the historical myth of former President John F Kennedy. In the presidential election on November 3, 1992, Clinton won over the incumbent George H. W. Bush. He then moved into the White House on January 20, 1993 as the 42nd President of the United States of America. At 46, he was the third youngest president in the history of the United States, after Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. Clinton's top priorities during his term in office were the introduction of health insurance, reconciliation with Vietnam, and combating drug abuse, gun violence, and poverty in the United States and the world.\nOn foreign policy matters, Clinton visited Germany on July 10, 1994. In Berlin he gave a speech in which Clinton, like John F. Kennedy in 1963, said in German \"America is at your side - now and forever.\" In 1994 he received an honorary doctorate from Oxford University. In terms of foreign policy, he supported the Israeli-Jordanian peace process, which led to the peace treaty between the two countries. At the CSCE summit in Budapest in 1995, Clinton, Boris Yeltsin and the presidents of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan exchanged views on the instruments of ratification of the START I Agreement. The Treaty on the Reduction of Nuclear Weapons with a Range of More Than 5,500 km, signed in 1991, thus came into force. In the following presidential election in November 1996, Clinton was able to clearly assert himself in office against Bob Dole. The summit meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Clinton in Helsinki ended in March 1997 without an agreement on the dispute over NATO's eastern expansion. In May 1997, Clinton traveled to Mexico on an official visit. It was the first visit by a US president to the neighboring country since 1979.\nIn May 1997, the \"Basic Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between the North Atlantic Organization and the Russian Federation\" was signed in Paris. After a long budget dispute between the administration and Congress, an agreement on tax cuts was reached. The US budget was brought out of the red for the first time since 1969. President Clinton's second term was overshadowed by allegations of sexually assaulting government employee Paula Jones in a hotel room in 1991. Clinton denied the accusation.\nFor the first time in the history of the United States, a sitting president testified under oath on his own behalf on January 17, 1998. On January 26, 1998, Clinton reaffirmed his sworn statement that he had not had an extramarital affair with his intern, Monica Lewinsky. Clinton also rejected the accusation that he had incited Lewinsky to make false statements with an affidavit. For the first time in 130 years, i.e. H. Since the presidency of Andrew Johnson, impeachment proceedings have again been opened against an American president in office.\nClinton later revised his statement. However, at the end of the investigation in 1999, the allegations were not sufficient for either impeachment or indictment. In March 1998, Clinton became the first US president to undertake an extensive tour of southern Africa. As part of this trip, he announced debt relief for African reform states. Paula Jones' lawsuit against Clinton was dismissed by the Arkansas federal court in April 1998. After bombings at the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the US fired cruise missiles at six suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan in retaliation on August 20, 1998. In October 1998, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat signed a peace agreement in Washington at Clinton's initiative. This got the peace process in the Middle East, which had been stalled for almost two years, back on track. Despite protests from the Chinese government, Clinton received the Dalai Lama at the White House in November 1998. As a result of the 2000 hacker attacks on the World Wide Web, a conference on Internet security issues began in Washington. Clinton advocated for a national security center.\nOn June 2, 2000, during his visit to Germany, Bill Clinton became the first US president to receive the International Charlemagne Prize from the city of Aachen. In his laudatory speech, Gerhard Schröder praised Clinton's commitment to growing together in Europe. That same month, he became the first U.S. president to deliver a speech to the Russian parliament. He offered Russia comprehensive cooperation. During his three-day visit to Moscow, he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and privately visited former President Boris Yeltsin. At the turn of the millennium, Bill Clinton completed his term as one of the most successful presidents of the United States. Above all, his commitment to new companies and technologies gave the USA the longest economic rise in its history. His successor as US President was George W. Bush, who was sworn in as the 43rd President of the United States on February 20, 2001. On June 22, 2004, Bill Clinton published his biography entitled \"My Life\" in New York. The almost 1,000-page work was pre-ordered two million times before publication.\nBill Clinton underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery in New York on September 6, 2004, but he survived without incident. The former US President is committed to fighting poverty, corruption and climate change worldwide with his \"Clinton Global Initiative\", which held its first conference in New York in mid-September 2005. For his tireless efforts to help the poorest, Bill Clinton was awarded the German media prize \"Bambi\" by Hubert Burda Medien in the \"Charity\" category in Germany in December 2005. In 2007 he was honored with the TED Prize and in 2013 Clinton was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States of America's highest civilian honor, by Barack Obama.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124132/?ref_=ls_i_6)\n6.

Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124133/?ls)\n, the 43rd president of the U.S., who is known as \"Bush 43\"), was born on June 12, 1924 in Milton, Massachusetts, a suburb south of Boston. His parents were Dorothy (Walker) and\nPrescott Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1778210/?ls)\n, who was then the president of sales for the Stedman Products Co. of South Braintree, Massachusetts. In 1925, Prescott joined the United States Rubber Co. (New York, NY) as their foreign division manager, necessitating a move to Greenwich, Connecticut.\nPrescott Bush (Yale 1917) made his fortune and name as an investment banker on Wall St., eventually becoming a partner of the white shoe brokerage Brown Bros. Harriman. He was a member of the Yale Corp., the principal governing body of Yale University, from 1944 to 1956 and was on the board of directors of the Columbia Broadcasting System (C.B.S.), after having been introduced to C.B.S. Chairman\nWilliam Paley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1013200/?ls)\nin 1932 by his friend and business partner\nAverell Harriman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364207/?ls)\n, a major Democratic party power-broker.\nGeorge Bush was educated at the exclusive Greenwich Country Day School in Greenwich, Connecticut before moving on to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he matriculated from 1936 to 1942. At Phillips Andover, he captained the baseball and soccer teams and was a member of an exclusive fraternity called the A.U.V, or \"Auctoritas, Unitas, Veritas\", Latin for \"Authority, Unity, Truth\". Like his father before him, Bush was on schedule to attend Yale College and would have in the fall of 1942, but for the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor by the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941 that necessitated the entry of the United States into World War II.\nUpon his graduation from Phillips Andover, George Bush enlisted in the U.S. Navy on June 12, 1942, his 18th birthday, with the intent on becoming an aviator. After completing the 10-month naval aviation course, he was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve three days before his nineteenth birthday, which made him the youngest naval aviator ever at the time.\nGeorge Bush married the former Barbara Pierce on January 6, 1945, and after he was demobilized, they moved to New Haven, Connecticut so that he could attend Yale, where he proved a fine student and captained the baseball team, which made it to the first College World Series. They had their first of six children, future President George Walker Bush, two days after the Fourth of July, 1946. In his senior year, George Bush was tapped for the exclusive secret society Skull & Bones, as had been his father (and as his son would be).\nUsing his father's connections and $2 million in seed money from his relatives (approximately $17 million in 2006 terms), George Bush prospered in the oil industry after graduating from Yale in 1949. Through his father's business and social relationship with a fellow Skull & Bones member, George Bush secured a position with Dresser Industries, on whose board of directors Prescott had served for 22 years.\nAs the son of a moderate Republican senator, it was natural that George Bush would stand for office. At the time, the \"Solid South\" was solidly Democratic, with the Republican Party of Civil War winner (and Civil Rights champion) Abraham Lincoln anathema below the Mason-Dixon line.Good Republican candidates were hard to come by (though John Tower later proved that a Republican could win in the Deep South when he took a Senate seat in 1966). One year after his father left the Seante, his son George stood won the Republican nomination to oppose Democratic Senator Ralph Yarborough, an ally of President 'Lyndon Johnson (I)' (QB), who was on his way to defeating Republican Presidential nominee\nBarry Goldwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326400/?ls)\nin an electoral landslide in 1964. Riding the coat-tails of favorite son Johnson, Yarborough handily won reelection, keeping George Bush in the private sector for two more years.\nBush stood for a House seat in 1966 and won, then won reelection in 1968. In Congress, he established a reputation as a liberal Republican and was known as a supporter of contraception services (his father, Prescott, had been a mainstay of Planned Parenthood). At the request of President\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\n, Bush gave up his seat voluntarily in 1970 to seek the Senate seat of Democratic Senator Ralph Yarborough, who was a fierce Nixon critic. It was felt that Yaborough's liberalism made him vulnerable to a challenge from the right, and it did; however, it was the right-wing of the Democratic Party. Lloyd Bentsen won the Democratic nomination and, endorsed by Yarborough, beat Bush handily in the November general election. (Ironically, Bentsen would one day be the running mate of Bush's 1988 rival for the presidency,\nMichael Dukakis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0241144/?ls)\n.) One of the reason for Bush's defeat was that with Yarborough out of the race, Nixon's support for Bush's campaign was only half-hearted.\nAs a payback to Bush, Nixon appointed him Ambassador to the United Nations, and he later served Nixon as the Chairman of the Republican National Committee during the Watergate crisis. Nixon's successor in the Oval Office,\nGerald Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004934/?ls)\n, briefly considered appointing Bush as his replacement as vice president before going with liberal Republican stalwart\nNelson Rockefeller (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734224/?ls)\n, the four-term governor of the State of New York, but Ford eventually appointed Bush as the first American plenipotentiary to Communist China, then later director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\nAfter losing the 1980 Republican nomination to\nRonald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ls)\n, Bush was chosen as Reagan's running mate and elected Vice President of the United States in Reagan's victory over incumbent President\nJimmy Carter (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141699/?ls)\nin November. In 1988, Bush as vice president was Reagan's heir apparent, and he won the Republican nomination handily, though personally he was not very popular. Bush was perceived as \"weak\" due to his social liberalism, which included support for abortion rights and contraception. As a \"Rockefeller Republican\" (that is, an Eastern Establishment pro-business Republican who is moderate or liberal on social issues), Bush, unlike Reagan, was out-of-step in an increasingly conservative party dominated by voters from the South and West. The well-educated, thoughtful Bush, according to Reagan biographer Edmund Morris, was a genuinely nice and gracious person, and more importantly: sincere. However, he was perceived as not standing for anything, at least not in the stark black & white terms that had inspired the conservative if not reactionary Republican Party faithful during the two terms of the \"Great Communicator\".\nAs president, Bush saw the collapse of the Soviet Union, and he soared to unprecedented levels of public approval after his firm handling of\nSaddam Hussein (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0404010/?ls)\n's invasion of Kuwait pushed the Iraqi army out of the invaded kingdom with a minimum amount of U.S. casualties. However, his popularity plummeted by the time the campaign rolled around in 1992 due to his seeming inability to cope with a recession caused by economic dislocations linked to the end of the Cold War.\nAfter the presidency, George Bush prospered financially as a corporate speaker, reportedly making as much as $10 million from the Reverend\nSun Myung Moon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0600671/?ls)\n. Bush's business ventures through the Carlyle Group, a private equity fund with close ties to the government of Saudi Arabia, have proved very remunerative. Most importantly, he achieved a sort of personal vindication when his son, George Walker Bush, defeated Clinton's vice president, Al Gore, and was elected the 43rd President of the United States.\nIn the twilight of his years, comfortably retired from the political wars, Bush teamed with fellow ex-President Bill Clinton for a uniquely close relationship in which the two jointly led campaigns to help the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 devastation of the Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina via private sector fund-raising.\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush died on November 30, 2018, in Houston, Texas.

Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740483/?ls)\n(even after he evolved into a Republican), and was a Democrat in the 1940s, a self-described 'hemophiliac' liberal. He was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1947 and served five years during the most tumultuous times to ever hit Hollywood. A committed anti-communist, Reagan not only fought more-militantly activist movie industry unions that he and others felt had been infiltrated by communists, but had to deal with the investigation into Hollywood's politics launched by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947, an inquisition that lasted through the 1950s. The House Un-American Activities Committee investigations of Hollywood (which led to the jailing of the \"Hollywood Ten\" in the late '40s) sowed the seeds of the McCarthyism that racked Hollywood and America in the 1950s.\nIn 1950, U.S. Representative\nHelen Gahagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0301099/?ls)\nDouglas (D-CA), the wife of \"Dutch\" Reagan's friend\nMelvyn Douglas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002048/?ls)\n, ran as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate and was opposed by the Republican nominee, the Red-bating Congressman from Whittier,\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\n. While Nixon did not go so far as to accuse Gahagan Douglas of being a communist herself, he did charge her with being soft on communism due to her opposition to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Nixon tarred her as a \"fellow traveler\" of communists, a \"pinko\" who was \"pink right down to her underwear.\" Gahagan Douglas was defeated by the man she was the first to call \"Tricky Dicky\" because of his unethical behavior and dirty campaign tactics. Reagan was on the Douglases' side during that campaign.\nThe Douglases, like Reagan and such other prominent actors as\nHumphrey Bogart (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000007/?ls)\nand\nEdward G. Robinson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000064/?ls)\n, were liberal Democrats, supporters of the late\nFranklin D. Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740483/?ls)\nand his New Deal, a legacy that increasingly was under attack by the right after World War II. They were NOT fellow-travelers; Melvyn Douglas had actually been an active anti-communist and was someone the communists despised. Melvyn Douglas, Robinson and\nHenry Fonda (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000020/?ls)\n- a registered Republican! - wound up \"gray-listed.\" (They weren't explicitly black-listed, they just weren't offered any work.) Reagan, who it was later revealed had been an F.B.I. informant while a union leader (turning in suspected communists), was never hurt that way, as he made S.A.G. an accomplice of the black-listing.\nReagan's career sagged after the late 1940s, and he started appearing in B-movies after he left Warner Bros. to go free-lance. However, he had a eminence grise par excellence in\nLew Wasserman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1348282/?ls)\n, his agent and the head of the Music Corp. of America. Wasserman, later called \"The Pope of Hollywood,\" was the genius who figured out that an actor could make a killing via a tax windfall by turning himself into a corporation. The corporation, which would employ the actor, would own part of a motion picture the actor appeared in, and all monies would accrue to the corporation, which was taxed at a much lower rate than was personal income. Wasserman pioneered this tax avoidance scheme with his client\nJames Stewart (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000071/?ls)\n, beginning with the\nAnthony Mann (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0542649/?ls)\nwestern\nWinchester '73 (1950) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043137/?ls)\n(1950). It made Stewart enormously rich as he became a top box office draw in the 1950s after the success of \"Winchester 73\" and several more Mann-directed westerns, all of which he had an ownership stake in.\nIronically, Reagan became a poor-man's James Stewart in the early 1950s, appearing in westerns, but they were mostly B-pictures. He did not have the acting chops of the great Stewart, but he did have his agent. Wasserman at M.C.A. was one of the pioneers of television syndication, and this was to benefit Reagan enormously. M.C.A. was the only talent agency that was also allowed to be a producer through an exemption to union rules granted by S.A.G. when Reagan was the union president, and it used the exemption to acquire Universal International Pictures. Talent agents were not permitted to be producers as there was an inherent conflict of interest between the two professions, one of which was committed to acquiring talent at the lowest possible cost and the other whose focus was to get the best possible price for their client. When a talent agent was also a producer, like M.C.A. was, it had a habit of steering its clients to its own productions, where they were employed but at a lower price than their potential free market value. It was a system that made M.C.A. and Lew Wasserman, enormously wealthy.\nThe ownership of Universal and its entry into the production of television shows that were syndicated to network made M.C.A. the most successful organization in Hollywood of its time, a real cash cow as television overtook the movies as the #1 business of the entertainment industry. Wasserman repaid Ronald Reagan's largess by structuring a deal by which he hosted and owned part of\nGeneral Electric Theater (1953) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045395/?ls)\n, a western omnibus showcase that ran from 1954 to 1961. It made Reagan very comfortable financially, though it did not make him rich. That came later.\nIn 1960, with the election of the Democratic President\nJohn F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448123/?ls)\n, the black and gray lists went into eclipse. J.F.K. appointed Helen Gahagan Douglas Treasurer of the United States. About this time, as the civil rights movement became stronger and found more support among Democrats and the Kennedy administration, Reagan - fresh from a second stint as S.A.G. president in 1959 - was in the process of undergoing a personal and political metamorphosis into a right-wing Republican, a process that culminated with his endorsing\nBarry Goldwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326400/?ls)\nfor the Republican presidential nomination in 1964. (He narrated a Goldwater campaign film played at the G.O.P. Convention in San Francisco.) Reagan's evolution into a right-wing Republican sundered his friendship with the Douglases. (After Reagan was elected President of the United States in 1980, Melvyn Douglas said of his former friend that Reagan turned to the right after he had begun to believe the pro-business speeches he delivered for General Electric when he was the host of the \"G.E. Theater.\")\nIn 1959, while Reagan was back as a second go-round as S.A.G. president, M.C.A.'s exemption from S.A.G. regulations that forbade a talent agency from being a producer was renewed. However, in 1962, the U.S. Justice Department under Attorney General\nRobert F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448305/?ls)\nsuccessfully forced M.C.A. - known as \"The Octopus\" in Hollywood for its monopolistic tendencies - to divest itself of its talent agency.\nWhen Reagan was tipped by the California Republican Party to be its standard-bearer in the 1965 gubernatorial election against Democratic Governor Pat Brown, Lew Wasserman went back in action. Politics makes strange bedfellows, and though Wasserman was a liberal Democrat, having an old friend like Reagan who had shown his loyalty as S.A.G. president in the state house was good for business. Wasserman and his partner, M.C.A. Chairman Jules Styne (a Republican), helped ensure that Reagan would be financially secure for the rest of his life so that he could enter politics. (At the time, he was the host of \"Death Valley Days\" on TV.)\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Universal sold Reagan a nice piece of land of many acres north of Santa Barbara that had been used for location shooting. The Reagans sold most of the ranch, then converted the rest of it, about 200 acres, into a magnificent estate overlooking the valley and the Pacific Ocean. The Rancho del Cielo became President Reagan's much needed counterpoint to the buzz of Washington, D.C. There, in a setting both rugged and serene, the Reagans could spend time alone or receive political leaders such as the Soviet President\nMikhail Gorbachev (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329784/?ls)\n, Margaret Thatcher, and others.\nReagan was known to the world for his one-liners, the most famous of them was addressed to\nMikhail Gorbachev (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329784/?ls)\nin 1987. \"Mister Gorbachev, tear down this wall\" said Reagan standing in front of the Berlin Wall. That call made an impact on the course of human history.\nRonald Reagan played many roles in his life's seven acts: radio announcer, movie star, union boss, television actor-cum-host, governor, right-wing critic of big government and President of the United States.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141699/?ref_=ls_i_8)\n8.

His parents separated two weeks after his birth and his mother took him to Grand Rapids, Michigan to live with her parents. On February 1, 1916, his mother Dorothy married Gerald R. Ford, a paint salesman. The Fords began calling their son Gerald R. Ford, Jr. but the name became legal only on December 3, 1935. Aged 13, Ford knew that Gerald Sr., was not his biological father, but it wasn't until 1930 he met his biological father Leslie King, who had made an unexpected stop in Grand Rapids.\nFord grew up in a family with three younger half-brothers, Thomas, Richard, and James. He attended South High School in Grand Rapids, where he already showed his athletics skills, being named to the honor society and the \"All-City\" and \"All-State\" football teams. As a scout he was ranked Eagle Scout in November 1927. He earned money by working in the family paint business and at a local restaurant.\nFord attended The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor from 1931 to 1935. He majored in economics and political science and graduated with a B.A. degree in June 1935. He played on the University's national championship football teams in 1932 and 1933 and was voted MVP of Wolverine in 1934. He also played in All-Star and benefit football games. He denied offers from two professional football teams, (Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers), but chose to become boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach at Yale hoping to attend law school there. Ford earned his law degree in 1941.\nAfter returning to Michigan and passing his bar exam, Ford set up a law partnership in Grand Rapids with Philip Buchen, a University of Michigan fraternity brother (who later served on Ford's White House staff as Counsel to the President).\nIn April 1942 Ford joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and became a physical fitness instructor at a flight school in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In the spring of 1943 he began service in the light aircraft carrier USS Monterey. Ford spent the remainder of the war ashore and was discharged as a lieutenant commander in February 1946. He returned to Grand Rapids to become a partner in the locally prestigious law firm of Butterfield, Keeney, and Amberg.\nHis first political experience was in the summer of 1940 when he was working in the presidential campaign of Wendell Willkie. Six years later he decided to challenge Bartel Jonkman for the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1948 election. Ford won the nomination and after that was elected to Congress on November 2, 1948, receiving 61% of the vote.\nOn October 15 1948, the height of the campaign, Ford married Elizabeth ('Betty') Anne Bloomer Warren, a department store fashion consultant. Betty was born on April 8, 1918 in Chicago, Illinois, but grew up in Grand Rapids. They subsequently had four children: Michael Gerald (March 14, 1950), John Gardner (March 16, 1952), Steven Meigs (May 19, 1956) and Susan Elizabeth (July 6, 1957).\nFord served in the House of Representatives from January 3, 1949 to December 6, 1973. He was re-elected twelve times, winning each time with more than 60% of the vote. As his ambition was to become Speaker of the House already in the early 1950s, he denied offers to run for both the Senate and the Michigan governorship in these years. In 1961 he became chairman of the House Republican Conference. In 1963 President Johnson appointed Ford to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was the last living member of the Warren Commission.\nIn 1965 Ford was chosen as the House minority leader, a post he held until 1973. As minority leader Ford made more than 200 speeches a year all across the country, which made him nationally known. He was not only a close friend of Richard Nixon for many years, but also a loyal supporter in both the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections. As in 1960, Ford was again considered as a vice presidential candidate in 1968. Because the Republicans did not attain a majority in the House, Ford was unable to reach his ultimate political goal, Speaker of the House. Instead, he became President of the Senate.\nLate in 1973 Spiro Agnew pleaded no contest to a charge of income tax evasion and resigned as Vice President. President Nixon was empowered by the 25th Amendment to appoint a new vice president and chose Ford. He was sworn in on December 6, 1973.\nOn August 9, 1974, Nixon became the first president in U.S. history to resign from the office under the threat of impeachment in the Watergate scandal. The same day Gerald R. Ford took the oath of office as 38th President of the United States on August 9, 1974. Also in August 1974, Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller for vice president, which nomination was confirmed by Congress on December 19, 1974.\nOne month after taking office President Ford faced one of the toughest decisions in his career. He decided to grant Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon for all offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in. The public opinion was mostly negative about the pardon and there was even suspicion Ford and Nixon had made a deal to grant a pardon if Nixon would resign. Although this happened on September 8, 1974, it might have cost the re-election of Ford two years later.\nOn November 24, 1974, in the conference hall of the Okeansky Sanitarium, Vladivostok, USSR, President Ford and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev signed the SALT-treaty, following talks on the limitation of strategic offensive arms.\nIn March 1975, during the final days of the Vietnam War, Ford ordered the airlift of about 237,000 Vietnamese refugees to the United States. Two months later, on May 14, 1975, Ford ordered U.S. forces to retake the S.S. Mayaguez after its seizure by Cambodia, an action Ford characterized as an \"act of piracy.\" The operation saved the ship's 39-member crew, but sadly 41 Americans were killed and 50 more wounded during the preparation and execution of the rescue.\nPresident Ford was twice the target of assassination attempts. Both took place in on two separate trips to California in September 1975 and both were 'performed' by women. On September 5, 1975 he survived an assassination attempt in Sacramento, California, by Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, a member of a cult once led by convicted mass murderer Charles Manson. On September 22, 1975, in San Francisco, California, Sara Jane Moore fired a shot at the president, but a bystander diverted the shot.\nDespite his former athletics skills, Gerald Ford tumbled several times during his presidency. No cause was ever communicated. At the Republican National Convention in August 1976, Ford fought off a serious challenge from Californian Governor Ronald Reagan to be nominated as his party's presidential candidate. He chose Senator Robert Dole of Kansas as his running mate.\nAlthough he succeeded in closing in on Democrat Jimmy Carter's large lead in the polls, President Ford finally lost one of the closest elections in history in November 1976. After leaving office, Gerald and Betty Ford returned to private life and moved to California where they built a new house in Rancho Mirage, which became his last residence.\nPresident Ford continued to actively participate in the political process and to speak out on important political issues. He lectured at hundreds of colleges and universities. In 1981, the Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, were dedicated.\nPresident Ford was the recipient of numerous awards and honors by many civic organizations, like the recipient of many honorary Doctor of Law degrees from various public and private colleges and universities.\nIn August 1999, President Bill Clinton presented Ford with the nation's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom. Two months later, in\nOctober 1999, Senate and House leaders presented Ford and his wife, Betty, with the Congressional Gold Medal. Together with former President Carter, he served as honorary Co-Chair of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001. In May 2001 he was presented with the Profiles in Courage award for his controversial decision to pardon former President Nixon.\nIn August 2000 Ford suffered a mild stroke while attending the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On May 16, 2003 following fluctuations in blood pressure and hot weather, Ford suffered dizzy spells on the golf course and taken to hospital. He was released the next day.\nAlthough President Ford cut back on his travel and public appearances in recent years, he attended funeral services for President Ronald Reagan at Washington's National Cathedral, sitting with former Presidents Clinton, Bush and Carter, and their wives in June 2004.\nIn August 2006, he was discharged from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, after doctors tried to reduce or eliminate blockages in his coronary arteries. They also implanted a pacemaker to improve his heart performance. In the fall of 2006 Ford spent several days at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage for medical tests. He was released on October 16.\nOn November 12, 2006, Ford officially became the longest-lived president, surpassing Ronald Reagan. Ford would extend the record by 45 days.\nOn December 26, 2006 at 6:45 p.m., President Ford died in his house in Rancho Mirage, California. He was aged 93 years and 165 days old, making him the longest-lived United States President. No cause of death was communicated. A state funeral and memorial services were held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on January 2, 2007. President Ford was buried at his presidential museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nPresident Gerald Ford was survived by his wife Betty, after more than 58 years of marriage, and by their four children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. He was also survived by his brother, Richard, of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ref_=ls_i_10)\n10.

Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448132/?ls)\n. John was named\nafter his maternal grandfather, John \"HoneyFitz\" Fitzgerald, the mayor\nof Boston. John was very ill as a child and was given the last rites\nfive times, the first one being when he was a new-born. He was the\nsecond of four boys born to an Irish Catholic family with nine\nchildren: Joseph Jr., John,\nRobert F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448305/?ls)\n(called Bobby), and\nTed Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448356/?ls)\n(born Edward). Because\nRose made Joe and Jack (the name his family called him) wear matching\nclothes, they fought a lot for attention. When John was young, the\nfamily moved from Boston to New York. John went to Choate, a private\nschool. Most of the time, though, he was too sick to attend. In the\nlate 1930s, father Joe became the ambassador to England. He took sons\nJohn and Robert with him, as well as his wife and daughters Kathleen\nand\nRosemary Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1812993/?ls)\n. John went\nto Princeton, then Harvard, and for his senior thesis, he wrote a piece\nabout why England refused to get into the war until late. It was\npublished in 1940 and called \"Why England Slept\". His older brother Joe\nwas a pilot during the war, and was killed when the bombs his plane was\ncarrying exploded. Not long after that, John's sister Kathleen and her\nhusband died in a plane crash. In the early 1950s, John ran for\nCongress in Massachusetts and won.

They also had a stillborn daughter named Arabella and a son named Patrick\nBouvier, who died a few days after birth. In 1954, J.F.K. had to\nhave back surgery and in the hospital wrote his second book, \"Profiles\nin Courage\". His father always said that his son Joe was going to be\nPresident of the U.S.; when he died in World War II, though, that task\nwas passed on to John. He ran for president in 1960 against\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\nand narrowly won.

Eisenhower was born on Tuesday, October 14, 1890, as Dwight David Eisenhower, in Denison, Texas. He was the third of seven sons born to David Jacob Eisenhower and Ida Elizabeth Stover. Both of his parents were of German descent. Eisenhower studied at the West Point Military Academy from 1911-1915. He served with the infantry, became the #3 leader of the tank corps, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel by the end of the First World War. From 1922-1924 he served in the Panama Canal Zone as executive officer to General, Fox Conner. From 1925-1926 he studied at the Command and General Staff College in Kansas, and from 1928-1933 he served as executive officer to Gen. George V. Moseley: Assistant Secretary of War, in Washington, DC.\nEisenhower was chief military aide to Gen.\nDouglas MacArthur (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0531274/?ls)\nfrom 1933-1935. He accompanied MacArthur to the Philippines in 1935, and served there as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government until 1939. Back in Washington, he held various staff positions and was promoted to Brigadier General in September 1941. Shortly after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, on Sunday, December 7th, 1941. Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff. There he gradually rose to Assistant Chief of Staff under the Chief of Staff, Gen.\nGeorge C. Marshall (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0550895/?ls)\n. Although Eisenhower had no experience in active military command, Marshall recognized his organizational and administrative strength. It was his association with Marshall that brought Eisenhower to London in June 1942 as Commanding General of the European Theater of Operations. He was also appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces of the North African Theater of Operations, which was renamed the Mediterranean Theater of Operations after the capitulation of the German army in Africa. In September of 1943 Eisenhower oversaw the Allied invasion of Sicily and then of Italy, which led to the immediate surrender of Italian forces in southern Italy. However, the German Winter Line fortifications in Italy, kept fighting even after the fall of Berlin.\nEisenhower was in charge of planning and carrying out the Allied landings in Normandy, France, and the invasion of Germany. The first part of his plan, named Operation Overlord, was the largest seaborne operation in history. Under this plan, 2.8 million Allied troops from 12 nations crossed the English Channel. Starting on Tuesday, June 6th, 1944, known as \"D-Day\", they landed on the beaches of Normandy, France. After extremely fierce heavy fighting, the Allies breached the fortifications and pushed back the defending German forces. Two months later they reached Paris.\nAdolf Hitler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386944/?ls)\nhad ordered the German commander of Paris to destroy the city rather than let it fall into Allied hands, but that officer refused to carry out those orders and eventually surrendered the city to the Allies. After fighting that was not as fierce as was expected, the city of Paris was liberated on Friday, August 25th, 1944. Eisenhower was with French Gen.\nCharles de Gaulle (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0208540/?ls)\nat the Hotel de Ville, where they greeted the Allied forces and took part in the French victory parade. After liberating Belgium and the Netherlands, the Allied troops crossed into Germany. In 1945 US and Soviet armies linked up on the Elbe River, west of Berlin. Soon Eisenhower met with Russian Gen.\nGeorgi Zhukov (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955850/?ls)\nand the two made a trip to the Soviet Union; the first (and only) time Eisenhower did so. After the German surrender on Tuesday, May 8th, 1945, Eisenhower was made the Military Governor of the US Occupied Zone in Germany, based in Frankfurt. He ordered the detailed search, documentation, photographing and widespread dissemination of what went on in the Nazi death camps. By actions such as these, Eisenhower began the process of documenting the horrors of the Holocaust.\nAlthough he had never been in action himself, Eisenhower was respected as a brilliant military strategist and skilled political leader during the Second World War. He successfully dealt with conflicting demands from many sides, and managed to mollify such tough and determined personalities as\nWinston Churchill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0161476/?ls)\n,\nJoseph Stalin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0821672/?ls)\n, Gen.\nBernard L. Montgomery (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0599728/?ls)\nand Gen.\nGeorge S. Patton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0666567/?ls)\n. From 1945 to 1948 Eisenhower was Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, and from 1950-1952 was Supreme Commander of all NATO forces.\nEisenhower won the 1952 US presidential elections, with\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\nas his Vice President, and brought the Republicans back to national power after 20 years. He was President from 1953-1960, becoming the first and only army general to serve as President in the 20th Century, formally becoming a civilian during his term in office. He ended the Korean War and offered peaceful co-existence with the Soviet Union after the death of Stalin in 1953. He authorized the 1953 Iranian coup d'etat and the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat. He invited\nNikita Khrushchev (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451979/?ls)\nto his first visit to the US in 1959, and hosted him at his farm at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where his children and grandchildren met the family of the Soviet leader. Shortly after that, however, the Soviets shot down an American U2 spy plane, captured the pilot and canceled Eisenhower's reciprocal visit to the Soviet Union. Relations between the two superpowers deteriorated very quickly, leading to an increasingly rapid nuclear arms race and a dangerous standoff in the Cold War.\nDomestically, Eisenhower began the modernization and integration of American roads into the interstate highway system, modeled after the autobahn, which he saw in Germany. In spite of some serious setbacks with US-Soviet relations, overall his presidency was a successful example of a non-partisan approach to politics.\nAfter his presidential term expired (US Presidents can only serve two terms), Eisenhower was again commissioned a five-star general in the army. He lived in retirement on his farm in Gettysburg, where he wrote his memoirs. He died on Friday, March 28th, 1969, at the Army Hospital in Washington, DC, and was laid to rest in Abilene, Kansas, at the Eisenhower Presidential Library.\nThe complete lifetime of\nDwight D. Eisenhower (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252032/?ls)\n, was from Tuesday, October 14th, 1890, to Friday, March 28th, 1969. He lived 28,654 days, equaling 4,093 weeks & 3 days.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874288/?ref_=ls_i_14)\n14. Harry S.

A lifetime member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as a U.S. senator from the state of Missouri from 1935 to 1945. He was chosen as incumbent president Franklin D. Roosevelt's running mate for the 1944 presidential election. Truman was inaugurated as the 34th vice president in 1945 and served for less than three months until President Roosevelt died. Now serving as president, Truman implemented the Marshall Plan to rebuild the economy of Western Europe and established both the Truman Doctrine and NATO to contain the expansion of communism. He proposed numerous liberal domestic reforms, but few were enacted by the Conservative Coalition that dominated the Congress.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740483/?ref_=ls_i_15)\n15. Franklin D. Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740483/?ref_=ls_t_15)\nWriter\nEditorial Department\nAdditional Crew\nThe President's Mystery (1936) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028135/?ref_=ls_knf_15)\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt was born in Hyde Park,\nNew York, to James and Sara Roosevelt. His father was 54 at the time of\nFDR's birth and already had a grown son, nicknamed \"Rosy\". Sarah was\nonly 27 when FDR was born. Growing up, FDR had a happy but sheltered\nchildhood. His family was very wealthy and FDR had a very privileged\nupbringing, with trips to Europe and private tutors. Sara Roosevelt was\na loving but domineering and overprotective mother. FDR was a devoted\nson, but found clever and subtle ways to get around his mother's\ndomination. At 14 he was sent to Groton, an exclusive prep school led\nby the Rev. Endicott Peabody. FDR did not enjoy his time at Groton,\noften being teased by the other kids for having a formal and stuffy\nmanner. Since he had a nephew who was older than him, kids at Groton\ncalled him \"Uncle Frank\". He graduated from Groton in 1900 and went to\nHarvard, where he edited the \"Crimson\" but failed to be accepted into\nthe Porcellian Social Club. He graduated Harvard in 1903. Soon after\nthat he fell madly in love with his sixth cousin,\nEleanor Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740482/?ls)\n. They married in\n1905, with President\nTheodore Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740485/?ls)\ngiving the bride\naway. However, from the start Franklin and Eleanor's marriage was not a\nhappy one. She was quiet and shy, whereas he was boisterous and\noutgoing. The fact that his mother moved into the house next door to\ntheirs, and ran things, did not help. Franklin and Eleanor had six\nchildren (one child died in infancy). In 1910 Franklin was elected to\nthe New York State Legislature from Duchess County. There he made a\nname for himself as a crusading reformer who favored the \"average guy\"\nover big business and championed for honest government. In 1913 he was\nappointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy and served under\nJosephus Daniels (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199993/?ls)\nand President\nWoodrow Wilson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934306/?ls)\n. In 1918 he began\na love affair with his wife's social secretary, Lucy Mercer. When\nEleanor discovered the affair, she was understandably devastated and\ntold Franklin she wanted a divorce. At the urging of his mother,\nFrankilin chose to save the marriage and promised Eleanor that he would\nnever have anything more to do with Lucy. The damage was done, however,\nand Franklin and Eleanor never again shared the intimacies of marriage,\nbecoming more like political partners. In 1921 FDR was stricken with\npolio and paralyzed. He permanently lost the use of his legs, but\nrefused to let that thwart his political ambitions. He spoke at the\n1924 Democratic Convention for the candidacy of\nAlfred E. Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0808341/?ls)\n, then the\nGovernor of New York, calling him the \"Happy Warrior\". In 1928 FDR was\nelected Governor of New York and was well placed when the stock market\ncrashed in 1929. As governor he took the lead in providing relief and\npublic works projects for the millions of unemployed in the state. His\nsuccess as New York's governor made him a strong candidate for the\nPresidency in 1932. He easily beat incumbent President\nHerbert Hoover (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393885/?ls)\n.\nWhen Franklin Roosevelt was sworn in as President on March 4, 1933,\nmore than 15 million Americans were unemployed. Millions more had been\nhard hit by the Depression and the banking system had collapsed. FDR\nwasted no time in launching a radical economic recovery program, known\nas the New Deal. He created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC), which made the federal government the guarantor of people's\nbank deposits - not the banks themselves - and allowed drought-stricken\nfarmers to refinance their mortgages, He created public works programs\nincluding the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Civilian\nConservation Corps (CCC)--thus making the government the employer of\nlast resort--as well as setting up the Social Security system,\ninstituting a minimum wage, outlawing child labor--a widespread\npractice at the time, especially in mines, factories and textile\nmills--and mandating a 40-hour work week with overtime pay. In\nresponding to the Depression, FDR forever changed the role of the\nfederal government in American life. He was easily reelected in 1936,\ndefeating Republican Alf Landon in a landslide. His second term as\npresident was less successful than his first, however. The Supreme\nCourt had ruled a number of New Deal measures unconstitutional. With an\nelectoral mandate in the bank, FDR proposed \"packing\" the Supreme Court\nwith justices of his political persuasion for every judge over the age\nof 70 that did not retire. However, Congress refused to pass the\nSupreme Court packing plan, and from that point on FDR was unable to\nget Congress to pass much of his legislation. Also, fascism was rising\nrapidly throughout Europe and Asia. Germany's\nAdolf Hitler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386944/?ls)\nand Italy's\nBenito Mussolini (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615907/?ls)\nhad both seized power\nand began to conquer other countries, such as Ethiopia, Austria and\nCzechoslovakia. FDR was unable to respond to the threats from Europe\nand Asia, however, because sentiment in the US was strongly\nisolationist and Congress had passed a series of neutrality laws that\ngave the President very little power to respond to international\naggression. World War II began in September 1939 when Hitler invaded\nPoland. Nine months later all of Western Europe had fallen to Hitler.\nThe UK and its Commonwealth and Empire was standing alone. FDR wanted to help Britain, but had\nto move carefully and skillfully. He negotiated a deal in which the US\ngave Britain 50 old destroyers in exchange for bases in the Western\nHemisphere. With World War II underway, FDR took the unprecedented move\nof seeking a third term as president. He won that term in November\n1940, defeating Republican\nWendell Willkie (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932521/?ls)\n. Safely re-elected, he\nproposed a radical new program for helping Britain, known as\nLend-Lease, in which Britain could buy armaments and other supplies\nfrom the US but not have to pay for them until after the war. FDR used\nthe analogy of borrowing a neighbor's hose to put out a house fire to\nsell Lend-Lease. It passed and America became the \"arsenal of\ndemocracy\" as it began to build armaments for Britain and then the Soviet Union,\nwhen Hitler invaded it in mid-1941. Roosevelt met Britain's Prime\nMinister,\nWinston Churchill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0161476/?ls)\n,\nfor the first time in August 1941 where they drew up the Atlantic\nCharter. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise attack\non Pearl Harbor, destroying much of America's Pacific fleet. The next\nday,FDR declared war on Japan, calling December 7 \"a date that will\nlive in infamy.\" America was in the war, and not only against Japan,\nbut also against Germany and Italy. Under FDR's leadership, America quickly\ntransformed itself from a decaying nation of idle factories,\nimpoverished families, abandoned farms and masses of hobos roaming the\nstreets to a nation turning out planes, tanks, guns, military vehicles\nand other armaments on a scale that quickly dwarfed the capability of\nNazi Germany to do the same. World War II also changed American life as\nblacks got better jobs in the war plants and women began working\noutside the home in unprecedented numbers. Helped by Eleanor, FDR used\nthe war as a vehicle for social progress, securing better treatment for\nminorities and women, higher wages and better benefits for workers and\na GI bill, which guaranteed a free college education for all American\nsoldiers who fought in the war. In so doing, he created the American\nmiddle class of today.\nAfter a series of military defeats, the US and its allies began to win\nthe war. Invasions of North Africa and Italy were launched and the US\nstarted retaking islands in the South Pacific it had lost to Japan at\nthe beginning of the war, starting with the Battle of Midway in 1942.\nFDR met with Churchill several times throughout the war and with Soviet\nleader\nJoseph Stalin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0821672/?ls)\nat Tehran in 1943 and\nat Yalta in 1945. The Allied invasion of France, known as D-Day, was\nlaunched on June 6, 1944. As the war ended, FDR pushed for his dream of\na United Nations and for reforms that would ensure that another World\nWar would never happen. The United Nations did come to pass, as well as\nnew global institutions such as the World Bank and IMF. Also, FDR\nadvocated for decolonization of Africa and Asia, leading to the\ncollapse of the old European empires.\nBecause of the war, FDR felt he had no right to leave the presidency\nwhile Americans under his command were still fighting. So he sought a\nfourth term in 1944. His opponent was the new governor of New York,\nThomas E. Dewey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223150/?ls)\n, who ran a campaign of\ninnuendo, hinting that FDR was too ill to lead and that his government\nhad gone stale. FDR retaliated with a speech accusing the Republicans\nof attacking his dog, Fala. FDR won his fourth term in November 1944.\nIn January 1945 he journeyed to Yalta to confer with Churchill and\nStalin for the last time, to settle the postwar world and push for\nRussian participation in the United Nations. By this time FDR was\ngravely ill. After the Yalta Conference, he traveled to his resort at\nWarm Springs, Georgia, where he died suddenly of a massive stroke on\nApril 12, 1945. It was revealed that Lucy Mercer, his one-time lover,\nwas with him when he died and that she had secretly visited him in the\nWhite House a number of times during his last year.\nThere was an elaborate funeral for him, with a train procession from\nWarm Springs to Washington DC, then to Hyde Park, where he was buried.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393885/?ref_=ls_i_16)\n16. Herbert Hoover (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393885/?ref_=ls_t_16)\nAdditional Crew\nPublic Be Damned (1917) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0008471/?ref_=ls_knf_16)\nHerbert Hoover was born on August 10, 1874 in West Branch, Iowa. His\nfamily were devout Quakers. At age eight, Hoover was orphaned and was\nsent to live with relatives. They showed him little affection, but\ntaught him the importance of hard work and industry. In 1891, Hoover\nentered Stanford University's School of Engineering, graduating in\n1895. Four years later, he married his wife, Lou Henry and they had two\nsons, Herbert Jr. and Allan. From an early age, Hoover showed a\nprodigious talent for engineering and was hired by the engineering firm\nBewick and Moering, working in Australia and then in China. He was in\nChina when the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 broke out and he coordinated the\nbarricades of Americans trapped in China. At age forty, his engineering\ncareer was so successful that he was a millionaire. 1914 saw the\noutbreak of World War I in Europe. That was when he left his\nengineering career and entered public service. He organized a relief\neffort to feed starving Belgians, known as the Commission for the\nRelief of Belgium. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, President\nWoodrow Wilson asked Hoover to organize the Food Administration, which\nencouraged Americans to cut down on food consumption to help the war\neffort. After the end of World War I in 1918, Hoover organized a\nmassive relief effort to feed starving peoples in Europe, whose\ncountries had been devastated by the war. From 1921 to 1929, Herbert\nHoover served as Secretary of Commerce, under Presidents Harding and\nCoolidge, expanding the department and making it more active in working\nwith business and labor. In 1928, he was the Republican candidate for\nPresident and easily defeated his opponent, the Democratic Candidate,\nAlfred E. Smith. Herbert Hoover was sworn in as President on March 4,\n1929. Seven months after he entered office, the Stock Market crashed,\nending the \"Roaring Twenties\" and the economic boom of that decade and\nushered in the Great Depression. At first, Hoover was proactive in\nhandling this economic crisis, having meetings with business leaders on\nhow to weather the economic downturn, cutting taxes and increasing\nmoney for corporations and state governments. But none of this was\neffective in the teeth of the worst economic crisis in American\nhistory. He tried to calm the situation with statements like\n\"Prosperity is just around the corner,\" but they were not effective.\nHis dour demeanor and seemingly callous attitudes towards the millions\nof unemployed were what people saw in him, particularly when he refused\nto provide direct relief to the unemployed. Things came to a head in\nthe summer of 1932 when the Bonus Expeditionary Force (BEF), an army of\nWorld War I veterans, marched to Washington demanding immediate payment\nof a bonus promised to them in 1945. But the veterans wanted their\nmoney now. They camped out along the Anacostia River and lobbied for\ntheir bonus. The House of Representatives approved immediate payment,\nbut the Senate voted no. Hoover obtained $100,000 from Congress to buy\nthe veterans train tickets home. Many veterans accepted the offer, but\nmany stayed in Washington. At that point, the US army led by Gen.\nDouglas McArthur forcibly evicted the veterans from Washington, setting\ntheir camps on fire and forcing them out at gunpoint. In so doing,\nMcArthur disobeyed Presidential orders, but Hoover took full\nresponsibility for the eviction of the Bonus Marchers. In the 1932\nelection, Herbert Hoover was defeated in a landslide by Democrat\nFranklin D. Roosevelt. After he left office in 1933, Hoover returned to\nCalifornia and was an unstinting critic of FDR. After the death of his\nwife in 1944, Hoover moved to New York City where he lived his last\ntwenty years at the Waldorf Towers, remaining active in Republican\nParty politics. In 1946, President Harry Truman asked him to undertake\nyet another relief effort for the people of Europe; he and Truman\nbecame surprisingly good friends. In 1953, Hoover chaired a commission\nto increase efficiency in the Executive Branch of the Federal\nGovernment. He died on October 20, 1964 at age ninety.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177633/?ref_=ls_i_17)\n17. Calvin Coolidge (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177633/?ref_=ls_t_17)\nScreen Snapshots Series 9, No. 14 (1930) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765186/?ref_=ls_knf_17)\nThough three U.S. Presidents have died on the Fourth of July, John\nCalvin Coolidge was the first and only one to have been born on that\ndate, in 1874. He is also the only President to have had the oath of\noffice administered by his father, a justice of the peace, who swore\nhim in when the Coolidges received word of President\nWarren G. Harding (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1136403/?ls)\n's death. Coolidge's\nreputation is that of an unfeeling and lazy man, unaware of what was\ngoing on in the country and who dawdled while the United States drifted\ntoward the Great Depression. Yet history doesn't really support this\ncaricature of a man who actually was a highly intelligent and complex\nindividual.\nThough self-contained and terse, Coolidge was an extremely intelligent\nman and a fine scholar (his wedding gift to his wife, Grace Goodhue,\nwas his own translation of\nDante Alighieri (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0019604/?ls)\n's \"Inferno\". A week\nafter the wedding, Coolidge, ever the practical New Englander, also\npresented his wife with 52 pairs of his socks that needed mending).\nSome have argued that Coolidge was the best-prepared candidate ever to\nbecome President, having worked his way through a succession of\nelective political offices until he wound up as the Vice President\nunder Harding, attaining the presidency when Harding died in office in\nAugust of 1923. Coolidge was a laissez-faire proponent, believing, like\nJefferson, that the government governs best which governs least. In\nJuly of 1924 his son, Calvin Jr., died of blood poisoning. The younger\nCoolidge, like his mother, was an outgoing and gregarious boy, and his\ndeath affected his father deeply. Although some historians have\ncharacterized Coolidge's behavior in office as marked by laziness or\nindolence, it seems now that it was almost certainly a deep depression\nbrought about by the death of his son. Coolidge chose not to run in\n1928. Privately, his wife remarked to a friend that \"Daddy thinks there\nis going to be a Depression.\" On January 5, 1933, he died of heart\nfailure at his home in Northampton, Massachusetts.\nThough Coolidge was dismissed for years as a presidential lightweight,\nhis reputation has grown in recent years. President\nRonald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ls)\nretrieved Coolidge's\nportrait from storage and displayed it in the White House during his\ntenure in office, and a recent biography has provided a much more\nfavorable view of Coolidge and his presidency than had previously been\navailable.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1136403/?ref_=ls_i_18)\n18.

film producer, and director. Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.\nHe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is former U.S. Representative\nMike Capuano (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4576629/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister,\nCarly Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2869049/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n, and two younger siblings, a brother named\nScott Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3268924/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n, who is also an actor, and a sister named\nShana Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4974640/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the\nLee Strasberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833448/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\nTheatre Institute.\nOn the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on\nThe Fugitive (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247097/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n(CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring\nHarrison Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in\nCherry Falls (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175526/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\nand\nThe Newcomers (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221431/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n- two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in\nBoston Public (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247081/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n(Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature,\nNot Another Teen Movie (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277371/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n, a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (\nChyler Leigh (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500200/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n) into prom queen.\nAfter filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful -\nJust Married (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305711/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\nand\nEastwick (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362585/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n- he appeared in another listless teen comedy,\nThe Perfect Score (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314498/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n, playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n, a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and\nKim Basinger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000107/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\nas the damsel in distress,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\nfailed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in\nFantastic Four (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120667/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n, 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.\nThe year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance.\nThe Nanny Diaries (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489237/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n, where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie\nStreet Kings (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421073/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n, playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie\nThe Loss of a Teardrop Diamond (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0896031/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)\n.\nBorn\nJune 13, 1981\nMore at IMDbPro (https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/?rf=cons_nm_more&ref_=cons_nm_more)\nContact info (https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/?rf=cons_nm_contact&ref_=cons_nm_contact)\nAgent info (https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/?rf=cons_nm_agent&ref_=cons_nm_agent)\nResume (https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/?rf=cons_nm_ov_res&ref_=cons_nm_ov_res)\n[No Text] (https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/?rf=cons_nm_more&ref_=cons_nm_more)\nBorn\nJune 13, 1981\nIMDbProStarmeter (https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/?rf=cons_nm_meter&ref_=cons_nm_meter)\nTop 50022 (https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/?rf=cons_nm_meter&ref_=cons_nm_meter)\nAdd to list\nView contact info at IMDbPro (https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/?rf=cons_nm_contact&ref_=cons_nm_contact)\nAwards (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/awards/?ref_=nm_awd)\n8 wins & 61 nominations total\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/awards/?ref_=nm_awd)\nPhotos1069 (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/mediaviewer/rm3022227202/?ref_=nm_ph_sm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/mediaviewer/rm3022227202/?ref_=nm_ph_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/mediaviewer/rm1700623873/?ref_=nm_ph_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/mediaviewer/rm1353994241/?ref_=nm_ph_3)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/mediaviewer/rm1404325889/?ref_=nm_ph_1_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/mediaviewer/rm3819199489/?ref_=nm_ph_1_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/mediaviewer/rm3368048641/?ref_=nm_ph_1_3)\n+ 1.1K (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/mediaviewer/rm1939222273/?ref_=nm_ph_more)\nKnown for (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635#name_known_for)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=nm_knf_i_1)\nThe Avengers (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=nm_knf_t_1)\n8.0\nSteve Rogers\nCaptain America\n2012\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=nm_knf_c_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458339/?ref_=nm_knf_i_2)\nCaptain America: The First Avenger (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458339/?ref_=nm_knf_t_2)\n6.9\nCaptain America\nSteve Rogers\n2011\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458339/?ref_=nm_knf_c_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=nm_knf_i_3)\nCaptain America: Civil War (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=nm_knf_t_3)\n7.8\nSteve Rogers\nCaptain America\n2016\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=nm_knf_c_3)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/?ref_=nm_knf_i_4)\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/?ref_=nm_knf_t_4)\n7.7\nSteve Rogers\nCaptain America\n2014\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/?ref_=nm_knf_c_4)\nCredits (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635#credits)\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=nm0262635/filmography&ref_=nm_flmg_edt)\nActor\n63\nProducer\n5\nDirector\n1\nSoundtrack\n3\nSelf\n144\nThanks\n6\nArchive Footage\n46\nIMDbPro (https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/?ref_=cons_nm_filmo&rf=cons_nm_filmo)\nExpand below\nAll credits\nActor\nUpcoming\n1\nSacrifice (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32268992/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_unrel_cdt_t_1)\nMike Tyler\nCompleted (https://pro.imdb.com/title/tt32268992?rf=cons_nm_filmo&ref_=cons_nm_filmo)\n2025\nPrevious\n62\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30253473/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_img_1)\nMaterialists (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30253473/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_t_1)\n6.4\nJohn\n2025\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30253473/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_c_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30645201/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_img_2)\nHoney Don't!

He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theatre manager, in an artists' housing project in New York City's Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father's background, Diesel has said that he himself is \"definitely a person of colour\".\nHis first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin's fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York's hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel.\nFollowing high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career.

He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called\nMulti-Facial (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0226168/?ls)\n, which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000.\nMulti-Facial (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0226168/?ls)\nwas eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception.\nAfterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature,\nStrays (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149171/?ls)\n. Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped.

He began his acting career at the age of eight and continued working in films and on Swedish\ntelevision until he turned sixteen and decided acting was not the career for him. Life under a microscope lost its charm and perhaps due\nto the influence of\nMy Skarsgård (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0803891/?ls)\n, his physician mother, he stopped working as an actor, to continue his education.\nInstead of continuing college, at the age of nineteen, he entered compulsory military service (military conscription).

Chris Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/?ref_=ls_t_29)\nActor\nProducer\nDirector\nThe Avengers (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=ls_knf_29)\nChristopher Robert Evans is an American actor, film producer, and director. Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.\nHe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is former U.S. Representative\nMike Capuano (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4576629/?ls)\n. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister,\nCarly Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2869049/?ls)\n, and two younger siblings, a brother named\nScott Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3268924/?ls)\n, who is also an actor, and a sister named\nShana Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4974640/?ls)\n. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the\nLee Strasberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833448/?ls)\nTheatre Institute.\nOn the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on\nThe Fugitive (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247097/?ls)\n(CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring\nHarrison Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/?ls)\n. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in\nCherry Falls (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175526/?ls)\nand\nThe Newcomers (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221431/?ls)\n- two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in\nBoston Public (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247081/?ls)\n(Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature,\nNot Another Teen Movie (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277371/?ls)\n, a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (\nChyler Leigh (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500200/?ls)\n) into prom queen.\nAfter filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful -\nJust Married (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305711/?ls)\nand\nEastwick (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362585/?ls)\n- he appeared in another listless teen comedy,\nThe Perfect Score (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314498/?ls)\n, playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\n, a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and\nKim Basinger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000107/?ls)\nas the damsel in distress,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\nfailed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in\nFantastic Four (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120667/?ls)\n, 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.\nThe year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance.\nThe Nanny Diaries (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489237/?ls)\n, where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie\nStreet Kings (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421073/?ls)\n, playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie\nThe Loss of a Teardrop Diamond (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0896031/?ls)\n.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342029/?ref_=ls_i_30)\n30.

His father was of Irish and German descent, and his mother was of mostly English and French-Canadian ancestry. When he was six years old, his parents divorced. A year later, his mother married Eugene Addis, a Miami Beach police officer, and moved to Miami Shores, Florida. After graduating from Horace Mann Junior High School, Rourke's family moved to a house located on 47th Street and Prairie Avenue in Miami Beach. In 1969 Rourke attended Miami Beach Senior High School, where he played second-string first baseman under coach Skip Bertman. He also acted in a school play, \"The Serpent,\" directed by legendary \"Teacher To The Stars\"\nJay W. Jensen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1913148/?ls)\n.\nIn 1971 he graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School, and after working for a short time as a bus boy at the famed Forge Restaurant on Miami Beach, Rourke moved back to New York to seek out a career in acting.\nRourke's teenage years were more aimed toward sports more than acting. He took up self-defense training at the Boys Club of Miami. It was there he learned boxing skills and decided on an amateur career. At the age of 12, Rourke won his first boxing match as an 118-pound bantamweight, defeating Javier Villanueva. Some of his early matches were fought as Andre Rourke. He continued his boxing training at the famed 5th Street Gym in Miami Beach, soon joining the Police Athletic League boxing program. In 1969 Rourke, now weighing 140 pounds, sparred with former World Welterweight champion Luis Rodriguez. Rodriguez was the number one-rated middleweight boxer in the world and was training for his match with world champion\nNino Benvenuti (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0073058/?ls)\n. Rourke claims to have received a concussion in this sparring match.\nIn 1971, at the Florida Golden Gloves, Rourke received another concussion from a boxing match. Doctors told him to take a year off and rest. In 1972 Rourke knocked out Ron Robinson in 18 seconds and John Carver in 39 seconds. On Aug. 20, 1973, Rourke knocked out 'Sherman \"Big Train\"' Bergman' in 31 seconds. Shortly after, Rourke decided to retire from amateur boxing.\nFrom 1964 to 1973, Rourke compiled an amateur boxing record of 27 wins (17 by knockout) and 3 defeats. At one point, he reportedly scored 12 consecutive first-round knockouts. As an amateur, Rourke had been friendly with pro-boxer Tommy Torino. When Rourke decided to return to boxing as a professional in 1991, Torino promoted some of Rourke's fights. Rourke was trained by former pro-boxer\nFreddie Roach (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2635565/?ls)\nat Miami Beach's 5th Street Gym and the Outlaw Boxing Club Gym in Los Angeles. He made $250 for his pro debut, but by the end of his second year of boxing, he had earned a million dollars. In June 1994, Rourke appeared on the cover of World Boxing Magazine. He sparred with world champions\nJames Toney (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0867199/?ls)\n,\nJohn David Jackson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1230627/?ls)\n, and\nTommy Morrison (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607338/?ls)\n.\nRourke wished to have 16 professional fights and then fight for a world title. However, he retired in 1994 after eight bouts and never got his desired title fight. His boxing career resulted in severe facial injuries that required a number of operations to repair his damaged face. Rourke went back to acting but worked in relative obscurity until he won a Golden Globe Award for his role as Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson in\nThe Wrestler (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1125849/?ls)\n. He was nominated for Best Actor, as well, but lost.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206/?ref_=ls_i_32)\n32. Keanu Reeves (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206/?ref_=ls_t_32)\nActor\nProducer\nAdditional Crew\nThe Matrix (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/?ref_=ls_knf_32)\nKeanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means \"cool breeze over the mountains\" in Hawaiian, was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of\nPatric Reeves (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852983/?ls)\n, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu's father was born in Hawaii, of Native Hawaiian and Chinese ancestry while Keanu's mother is originally from Essex England. After his parents' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister,\nKim Reeves (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716238/?ls)\n, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was\nPaul Aaron (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007477/?ls)\n, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.\nAfter a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the\nRob Lowe (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000507/?ls)\nhockey flick\nYoungblood (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092272/?ls)\n, which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama,\nRiver's Edge (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860/?ls)\n, and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated\nDangerous Liaisons (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/?ls)\nwith director\nStephen Frears (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001241/?ls)\n.\nHis first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted \"Theodore\" Logan in\nBill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096928/?ls)\n. The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of\nRon Howard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/?ls)\n's comedy,\nParenthood (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098067/?ls)\nand\nLawrence Kasdan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001410/?ls)\n's\nI Love You to Death (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099819/?ls)\n.\nOver the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite\nRiver Phoenix (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000203/?ls)\n's narcoleptic male hustler in\nMy Own Private Idaho (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102494/?ls)\n, an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire's lair in\nDracula (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103874/?ls)\n, and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in\nMuch Ado About Nothing (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107616/?ls)\n.\nIn 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of\nSpeed (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/?ls)\n. Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like\nFeeling Minnesota (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116289/?ls)\nand\nThe Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119502/?ls)\n, and big films like\nA Walk in the Clouds (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114887/?ls)\nand\nThe Devil's Advocate (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971/?ls)\n.

After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings' cyberadventure,\nThe Matrix (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/?ls)\n.\nNow a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them\nThe Replacements (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191397/?ls)\n,\nThe Watcher (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0204626/?ls)\n,\nThe Gift (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219699/?ls)\n,\nSweet November (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230838/?ls)\n, and\nHardball (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180734/?ls)\n- before\nThe Matrix Reloaded (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/?ls)\nand\nThe Matrix Revolutions (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/?ls)\nwere both released in 2003.\nSince the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with\nSomething's Gotta Give (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337741/?ls)\n,\nThe Lake House (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410297/?ls)\n, and\nStreet Kings (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421073/?ls)\n. He's kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as\nConstantine (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/?ls)\n,\nA Scanner Darkly (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/?ls)\n, and\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970416/?ls)\n.

He reprised the role in\nJohn Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4425200/?ls)\n, taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3841486/?ref_=ls_i_33)\n33.

Although he has always been the lead vocals, rhythm guitar, and songwriter for American band\nThirty Seconds to Mars (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2012087/?ls)\n, Leto is an accomplished actor merited by the numerous, challenging projects he has taken in his life. He is known to be selective about his film roles.\nJared Leto was born in Bossier City, Louisiana, to Constance \"Connie\" (Metrejon) and Anthony L. \"Tony\" Bryant. The surname \"Leto\" is from his stepfather. His ancestry includes English, Cajun (French), as well as Irish, German, and Scottish. Jared and his family traveled across the United States throughout his childhood, living in such states as Wyoming, Virginia and Colorado. Leto would continue this trend when he initially dropped a study of painting at Philadelphia's University of the Arts in favor of a focus on acting at the School of Visual Arts in New York City.\nIn 1992, Leto moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career, intending to take acting roles on the side. Leto's first appearances on screen were guest appearances on the short-lived television shows\nCamp Wilder (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103382/?ls)\n,\nAlmost Home (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105939/?ls)\nand\nRebel Highway (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108902/?ls)\n. However, his next role would change everything for Leto. While searching for film roles, he was cast in the show,\nMy So-Called Life (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108872/?ls)\n(TV Series 1994-1995). Leto's character was \"Jordan Catalano\", the handsome, dyslexic slacker, the main love interest of \"Angela\" (played by\nClaire Danes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000132/?ls)\n). Leto contributed to the soundtrack of the film, and so impressed the producers initially that he was soon a regular on the show until its end.\nElsewhere, Leto began taking film roles. His first theatrically released film was the ensemble piece,\nHow to Make an American Quilt (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113347/?ls)\n, based on a novel of the same name and starring renowned actresses\nWinona Ryder (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000213/?ls)\n,\nAnne Bancroft (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000843/?ls)\n,\nEllen Burstyn (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000995/?ls)\n,\nJean Simmons (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001739/?ls)\nand\nAlfre Woodard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005569/?ls)\n. The film was a modest success and, while Leto's next film,\nThe Last of the High Kings (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116833/?ls)\n, was a failure, Leto secured his first leading role in\nPrefontaine (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119937/?ls)\n, based on long-distance runner Steven Prefontaine. The film was a financial flop, but was praised by critics, notably\nGene Siskel (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0803021/?ls)\nand\nRoger Ebert (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001170/?ls)\n. He also took a supporting role in the action thriller,\nSwitchback (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119210/?ls)\n, which starred\nDennis Quaid (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000598/?ls)\n, but the film was another failure.\nLeto's work was slowly becoming recognized in Hollywood, and he continued to find work in film. In 1998, everything turned for the better on all fronts. This was the year that Leto founded the band,\nThirty Seconds to Mars (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2012087/?ls)\n, with his brother,\nShannon Leto (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504720/?ls)\n, as well as\nMatt Wachter (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2428680/?ls)\n(who later left the group), and after two guitarists joined and quit,\nTomo Milicevic (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2430595/?ls)\nwas brought in as lead guitarist and keyboardist. As well as the formation of his now-famous band, Leto's luck in film was suddenly shooting for the better. He was cast as the lead in the horror film,\nUrban Legend (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146336/?ls)\n, which told a grisly tale of a murderer who kills his victims in the style of urban legends. The film was a massive success commercially, though critics mostly disliked the film. That same year, Leto also landed a supporting role in the film,\nThe Thin Red Line (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120863/?ls)\n. Renowned director\nTerrence Malick (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000517/?ls)\n's first film in nearly twenty years, the film had dozens of famous actors in the cast, including\nSean Penn (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000576/?ls)\n,\nWoody Harrelson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000437/?ls)\n,\nJohn Travolta (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000237/?ls)\n,\nNick Nolte (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000560/?ls)\nand\nElias Koteas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000480/?ls)\n, to name a few. The film went through much editing, leaving several actors out of the final version, but Leto luckily remained in the film.\nThe Thin Red Line (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120863/?ls)\nwas nominated for seven Oscars and was a moderate success at the box office. Leto's fame had just begun. He had supporting roles in both\nJames Mangold (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003506/?ls)\n's\nGirl, Interrupted (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172493/?ls)\n, and in\nDavid Fincher (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399/?ls)\n's cult classic,\nFight Club (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/?ls)\n, dealing with masculinity, commercialism, fascism and insomnia. While\nEdward Norton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001570/?ls)\nand\nBrad Pitt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/?ls)\nwere the lead roles, Leto took a supporting role and dyed his hair blond. The film remains hailed by many, but at the time, Leto was already pushing himself further into controversial films. He played a supporting role of \"Paul Allen\" in the infamous\nAmerican Psycho (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/?ls)\n, starring\nChristian Bale (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/?ls)\n, and he played the lead role in\nDarren Aronofsky (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004716/?ls)\n's\nRequiem for a Dream (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093/?ls)\n, which had Leto take grueling measures to prepare for his role as a heroin addict trying to put his plans to reality and escape the hell he is in. Both films were massive successes, if controversially received.\nThe 2000s brought up new film opportunities for Leto. He reunited with\nDavid Fincher (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399/?ls)\nin\nPanic Room (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258000/?ls)\n, which was another success for Leto, as well as\nOliver Stone (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000231/?ls)\n's epic passion project,\nAlexander (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346491/?ls)\n. The theatrical cut was poorly received domestically (although it recouped its budget through DVD sales and international profit), and though a Final Cut was released that much improved the film in all aspects, it continues to be frowned upon by the majority of film goers. Leto rebounded with\nLord of War (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/?ls)\n,\nwhich starred\nNicolas Cage (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/?ls)\nas an arms dealer who ships weapons to war zones, with Leto playing his hapless but more moral-minded brother. The film was an astounding look at the arms industry, but was not a big financial success. Leto's flush of successes suddenly ran dry when he acted in the period piece,\nLonely Hearts (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441774/?ls)\n, which had Leto playing \"Ray Fernandez\", one of the two infamous \"Lonely Hearts Killers\" in the 1940s. The film was a financial failure and only received mixed responses. Leto then underwent a massive weight gain to play \"Mark David Chapman\", infamous murderer of\nJohn Lennon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006168/?ls)\n, in the movie,\nChapter 27 (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488988/?ls)\n. While Leto did a fantastic job embodying the behavior and speech patterns of Chapman, the film was a complete flop, and was a critical bomb to boot. It was during this period that Leto focused increasingly on his band, turning down such films as\nClint Eastwood (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142/?ls)\n's World War 2 film,\nFlags of Our Fathers (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418689/?ls)\n.\nIn 2009, however, Leto returned to acting with\nMr. Nobody (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/?ls)\n. Leto's role as \"Nemo Nobody\" required him to play the character as far aged as 118, even as he undergoes a soul-searching as to whether his life turned out the way he wanted it to. The film was mostly funded through Belgian and French financiers, and was given limited release in only certain countries. Critical response, however, has praised the film's artistry and Leto's acting.\nHe made his directorial debut in 2012 with the documentary film\nArtifact (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2370718/?ls)\n.\nLeto remains the lead vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and main songwriter for Thirty Seconds to Mars. Their debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was released to positive reviews but only to limited success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005). Their following releases, This Is War (2009) and Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), received further critical and commercial success.\nAfter a five years hiatus from filming, Leto returned to act in the drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and co-starring Matthew McConaughey. Leto portrayed Rayon, a drug-addicted transgender woman with AIDS who befriends McConaughey's character Ron Woodroof. Leto's performance earned him an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor. In order to accurately portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body. He stated the portrayal was grounded in his meeting transgender people while researching the role. During filming, Leto refused to break character. Dallas Buyers Club received widespread critical acclaim and became a financial success, resulting in various accolades for Leto, who was awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role and a variety of film critics' circle awards for the role.\nIn 2016, he played the Joker in the super villain film\nSuicide Squad (2016) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386697/?ls)\n.\nLeto is considered to be a method actor, known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles. He often remains completely in character for the duration of the shooting schedules of his films, even to the point of adversely affecting his health.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1524440/?ref_=ls_i_39)\n39.

After conducting her first cold read, agents told her mother that \"it was the best cold read by a 14-year-old they had ever heard,\" and tried to convince her stage mother that she needed to spend the summer in Manhattan. After leaving the agency, Jennifer was spotted by an agent in the midst of shooting an H&M ad and asked to take her picture.

Mark Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000242/?ref_=ls_t_1)\nProducer\nActor\nComposer\nThe Fighter (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964517/?ref_=ls_knf_1)\nAmerican actor Mark Wahlberg is one of a handful of respected entertainers who successfully made the transition from teen pop idol to acclaimed actor. A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for\nThe Departed (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/?ls)\nwho went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in\nThe Fighter (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964517/?ls)\n, Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in\nTed (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637725/?ls)\n.\nMark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), French-Canadian, English, Irish and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn't have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark's mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son's subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He'd spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.\nThe young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.\nAround this time, his older brother\nDonnie Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005531/?ls)\nhad become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band\nNew Kids on the Block (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578753/?ls)\n. A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.\nDonnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his \"Funky Bunch\" and \"Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch\" was born. His debut album, \"Music for the People\", was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper's willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping \"bad boy\". Record producer\nDavid Geffen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311691/?ls)\nsaw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer\nCalvin Klein (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0458681/?ls)\n, Marky Mark was set up as the designer's chief underwear model.\nHis scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the\nNew Kids on the Block (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578753/?ls)\n's fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, \"Marky Mark's\" bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with\nMadonna (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000187/?ls)\nand her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper\nShabba Ranks (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1133072/?ls)\n, he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, \"You Gotta Believe\", had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.\nAdding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the \"Marky Mark\" moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in\nPenny Marshall (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001508/?ls)\n's\nRenaissance Man (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110971/?ls)\n. Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In\nRenaissance Man (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110971/?ls)\n, he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial\nThe Basketball Diaries (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112461/?ls)\nand chilled them in\nFear (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116287/?ls)\nas every father's worst nightmare.\nThe major turning point in Wahlberg's career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in\nPaul Thomas Anderson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000759/?ls)\n's\nBoogie Nights (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/?ls)\n. Since then, Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability, starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as\nThree Kings (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120188/?ls)\nand\nThe Perfect Storm (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177971/?ls)\n, popcorn flicks like\nPlanet of the Apes (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133152/?ls)\nand\nContraband (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1524137/?ls)\n, and even indies such as\nI Heart Huckabees (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/?ls)\n.\nWahlberg was the executive producer of such television series as\nBoardwalk Empire (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979432/?ls)\n,\nIn Treatment (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0835434/?ls)\nand the highly successful comedy\nEntourage (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387199/?ls)\n, which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood.\nWahlberg and his wife\nRhea Durham (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1081113/?ls)\nhave four children.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nActor/director/producer megastar, former Calvin Klein model\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255/?ref_=ls_i_2)\n2. Ben Affleck (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255/?ref_=ls_t_2)\nProducer\nActor\nWriter\nArgo (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/?ref_=ls_knf_2)\nBenjamin Géza \"Ben\" Affleck-Boldt was born on August 15, 1972 in Berkeley, California and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to mother Chris Anne (Boldt), a school teacher, and father Timothy Byers \"Tim\" Affleck, a social worker. Ben has a younger brother, actor\nCasey Affleck (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000729/?ls)\n, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, Géza, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor.\nAffleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series,\nThe Voyage of the Mimi (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124265/?ls)\n. It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor,\nMatt Damon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/?ls)\n. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including\nHands of a Stranger (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093141/?ls)\nand\nThe Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278695/?ls)\n. He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in\nDazed and Confused (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106677/?ls)\n. After that, he did mostly independent films like\nKevin Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/?ls)\n's\nMallrats (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/?ls)\nand\nChasing Amy (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118842/?ls)\nwhich were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for\nGood Will Hunting (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/?ls)\n, they gave it to their agent,\nPatrick Whitesell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925877/?ls)\n, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend\nKevin Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/?ls)\nwho took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997,\nGood Will Hunting (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/?ls)\nwas released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.\nAffleck chose such roles in the blockbusters\nArmageddon (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/?ls)\n,\nShakespeare in Love (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138097/?ls)\n, and\nPearl Harbor (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213149/?ls)\n. In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits\nChanging Lanes (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264472/?ls)\n,\nThe Sum of All Fears (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164184/?ls)\n, and\nDaredevil (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287978/?ls)\n, as well as the disappointing comedies\nGigli (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299930/?ls)\nand\nSurviving Christmas (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252028/?ls)\n. While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in\nHollywoodland (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427969/?ls)\n. In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films\nSmokin' Aces (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475394/?ls)\n,\nHe's Just Not That Into You (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001508/?ls)\n,\nState of Play (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473705/?ls)\n, and\nExtract (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1225822/?ls)\n. He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller\nGone Baby Gone (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452623/?ls)\n, which starred his brother,\nCasey Affleck (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000729/?ls)\n, and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in\nThe Town (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840361/?ls)\n, which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller\nArgo (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/?ls)\n, which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck's second Oscar win).\nIn 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller\nGone Girl (2014) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2267998/?ls)\n. He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2975590/?ls)\n,\nSuicide Squad (2016) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386697/?ls)\n, and\nJustice League (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974015/?ls)\n. He reprised the role in\nZack Snyder's Justice League (2021) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12361974/?ls)\nand he will next appear as Batman in\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9663764/?ls)\nand\nThe Flash (2023) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439572/?ls)\n.\nRecently he has given praise-worthy performances in\nThe Way Back (2020) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8544498/?ls)\nas a recovering alcoholic,\nThe Last Duel (2021) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4244994/?ls)\n(notably he also co-wrote the script), and a scene-stealing golden globe nominated performance in\nThe Tender Bar (2021) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3108894/?ls)\n.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nActor/director, broke into showbiz with childhood pal Matt Damon\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/?ref_=ls_i_3)\n3. Matt Damon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/?ref_=ls_t_3)\nProducer\nActor\nWriter\nGood Will Hunting (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/?ref_=ls_knf_3)\nMatthew Paige Damon was born on October 8, 1970, in Boston, Massachusetts, to\nKent Damon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1497320/?ls)\n, a stockbroker, realtor and tax preparer, and\nNancy Carlsson-Paige (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1497472/?ls)\n, an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother, Kyle, a sculptor. His father was of English and Scottish descent, and his mother is of Finnish and Swedish ancestry. The family lived in Newton until his parents divorced in 1973, when Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community, and was raised near actor\nBen Affleck (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255/?ls)\n.\nDamon attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. He attended Harvard University as an English major. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film,\nRising Son (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100497/?ls)\n, and prep-school drama,\nSchool Ties (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105327/?ls)\n. It was until his film,\nGeronimo: An American Legend (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107004/?ls)\n, was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely. Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy,\nMystic Pizza (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095690/?ls)\n. However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in\nSchool Ties (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105327/?ls)\n. Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie,\nCourage Under Fire (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115956/?ls)\n. Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems.\nThe following year, he garnered accolades for\nGood Will Hunting (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/?ls)\n, a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University.\nGood Will Hunting (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/?ls)\nwas nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with\nBen Affleck (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255/?ls)\n.

With an Academy Award under his belt and a reputation as a powerful leading man, Casey Affleck has established himself as one of the most compelling and versatile actors in contemporary cinema. Throughout his career, he has consistently delivered performances of exceptional depth and nuance in a wide range of film genres.\nAffleck's breakout role came in Andrew Dominik's critically acclaimed character drama, \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" (2007). His performance as Robert Ford, a young man consumed by a complex cocktail of admiration and resentment for the notorious outlaw Jesse James (portrayed by Brad Pitt), earned him widespread recognition, including Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.\nHe solidified his critical acclaim with a starring role in his brother Ben Affleck's directorial debut, \"Gone, Baby, Gone\" (2007). This gripping neo-noir followed two Boston-based private detectives searching for an abducted young girl. Affleck's performance, showcasing both vulnerability and determination, further cemented his reputation as a rising dramatic force.\nThe following decade saw Affleck continue to diversify his roles, venturing outside the realm of independent drama to blockbuster productions. He was seen in Christopher Nolan's ambitious sci-fi epic \"Interstellar\" (2014) alongside an ensemble cast including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. Affleck also appeared in Scott Cooper's gritty crime thriller, \"Out of the Furnace\" (2013), where he shared the screen with Christian Bale.\nHis versatility continued to shine with his performance in the independent film \"Ain't Them Bodies Saints\" (2013), showcasing a quieter, more brooding side to his acting talents. That same year, Affleck turned his attention to production, establishing The Affleck/Middleton Project with John Powers Middleton as a platform to develop and produce a diverse array of film and television projects.\nAffleck's directorial work came to fruition with the release of the mockumentary \"I'm Still Here\" (2010), which he directed, wrote, and produced, featuring Joaquin Phoenix in a performance art piece that blurred the lines between fiction and reality. This experimental project demonstrated Affleck's willingness to challenge conventional storytelling formats.\nIn 2016, Affleck returned to the spotlight with his career-defining performance in Kenneth Lonergan's profoundly moving drama, \"Manchester by the Sea.\" His portrayal of Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken man coping with immense loss, earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. This raw and unforgettable performance cemented Affleck's status as one of the industry's finest dramatic actors.\n2016 also saw Affleck star in several other notable films, including the action thriller \"Triple 9\" (2016) and Disney's historical drama, \"The Finest Hours.\" He further expanded his range with roles in independent films like David Lowery's \"A Ghost Story\" (2017), a meditative exploration of loss and the passage of time.\nAffleck has continued to take on challenging projects that have pushed his boundaries as an actor. Most recently, he starred opposite Elisabeth Moss in the psychological thriller \"Light of My Life\" (2019), which he also wrote and directed.\nHis upcoming projects include a pivotal role in Christopher Nolan's highly-anticipated \"Oppenheimer\" (2023), where he portrays theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer himself. Affleck is also slated to star in \"Slingshot\" (2024), a science fiction thriller set in space.\nCasey Affleck's talent for embodying complex, flawed characters with profound authenticity has made him one of the most sought-after actors in the industry. With his captivating performances, dedication to his craft, and his discerning eye for unique storytelling projects, the future remains bright for this remarkable actor.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nStar of\nGone Baby Gone\n, film director, brother of Ben Affleck\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005531/?ref_=ls_i_5)\n5. Donnie Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005531/?ref_=ls_t_5)\nActor\nProducer\nComposer\nSaw II (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432348/?ref_=ls_knf_5)\nDonald Edmond \"Donnie\" Wahlberg Jr. was born on August 17, 1969 in Boston, Massachusetts into a family of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), Irish, and more distant French-Canadian, English, and Scottish, descent. He is the eighth of nine children of Alma Elaine Conroy (née Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk & Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. His parents eventually divorced and Donnie, finding himself already in trouble, discovered a positive outlet performing in school plays and became involved in varied aspects of theater -- acting, writing, and directing. At 15, he became a member of the teen vocal group originally called NYNUK. Donnie's little brother,\nMark Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000242/?ls)\nwas originally one of the Boys but balked at the direction the group was taking and backed out.\nA founding member of the boy band \"New Kids on the Block,\" the five teens survived a false start with their debut album and proceeded to hit #1 with the single \"Please Don't Go Girl\" on their second in 1988. They continued to bombard the market with one-after-another \"Top Ten\" hits including \"The Right Stuff\" and \"I'll Be Loving You Forever.\" Leaving the young girls panting for more, they became one of the hottest young singing/line-dancing groups to hit the late 80s/early 90s. The Boys went on to sell over 70 million albums worldwide, and provoke the spawning of other five-member harmony groups such as Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. During its heyday, Donnie played up his resident \"bad boy\" persona by tallying up several run-ins with the law, including an alleged arson at a Kentucky hotel (charges were dropped). He also delved into \"body art\" with numerous tattoos and body piercings in an effort to buck their already-cloying image. Amid intergroup dissension and Milli Vanilli-like charges of not contributing all the vocals to their albums, the pop band finally disbanded in 1994 -- partly out of frustration but also having outgrown the group's juvenile moniker.\nUnsure of his direction while attracting more trouble in the tabloids, Donnie, who helped write, arrange and produce brother Mark's Funky Bunch group's first two albums a few years earlier, switched gears. He rapped some and modeled some, then transformed himself into an actor, a route taken earlier by his talented bro. While Mark has turned out to become the bigger film star over the years, Donnie has stepped out of his shadows to receive raves and renewed respect for his own tense and compelling character work.\nHe first showed up in big screen action. Making his debut as a \"tough guy\" thug in the\nMickey Rourke (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000620/?ls)\nurban outing\nBullet (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115781/?ls)\n, filmed in 1994 but not released until two years later. Usually cast as an amoral heavy, Donnie moved up the quality ladder with director\nRon Howard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/?ls)\n's thriller\nRansom (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117438/?ls)\nas part of a gang of kidnappers who nab\nMel Gibson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000154/?ls)\n's son, to their eventual regret, of course. His next repellent took the form of a drug dealer in the goth indie horror\nBlack Circle Boys (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118730/?ls)\n, but the film came and went. After a couple of TV movies, he finally nabbed a starring role in the film\nSouthie (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118766/?ls)\nplaying more or less himself as an Irish-American prodigal son who returns to the mean streets of his native Boston. The movie also featured another brother\nRobert Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906301/?ls)\nwho also was testing the acting waters.\nIronically, one of Donnie's most powerful roles during this period was also one of his briefest. Seen in the opening sequence, he is nearly unrecognizable (having dropped an alarming amount of weight) portraying a deranged former patient of psychiatrist\nBruce Willis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/?ls)\nwhose sudden explosion into unfathomable violence sets up the clever twists and turns that turned\nM.

Donnie's opening bit was mouth dropping and jarring in its horror. He also proved he wasn't a flash in the pan by backing up this performance with a major role as a WWII paratrooper in the critically-hailed ten-part epic\nBand of Brothers (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/?ls)\n, which won multiple Emmy awards (6).\nThis TV role directly led to his casting as a gritty L.A. detective in the NBC dramatic series\nBoomtown (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319960/?ls)\n, an acclaimed series that didn't survive a second season. Since then Donnie has patented his unrefined intensity into a number of films such as\nTriggermen (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283077/?ls)\n,\nDreamcatcher (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285531/?ls)\n,\nSaw II (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432348/?ls)\n,\nAnnapolis (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417433/?ls)\n,\nSaw III (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489270/?ls)\n,\nSaw IV (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0890870/?ls)\nand\nZookeeper (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1222817/?ls)\n. He has also clocked in lead roles for such roughhewn TV series as\nRunaway (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805665/?ls)\n,\nThe Kill Point (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862593/?ls)\n,\nReturn of the Mac (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6329316/?ls)\nand, most notably, as detective Danny Reagan in\nBlue Bloods (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1595859/?ls)\n.\nDonny has two sons, Xavier and Elijah, by first wife Kim Fey, and is married to actress/producer/writer\nJenny McCarthy-Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000189/?ls)\n. As a former teen heartthrob seemingly headed down a troubled and dangerous path after his initial success, he somehow managed to avoid the traditional pitfalls of drugs and self-destruction, and has since proven himself an actor with \"the right stuff.\" In addition, the \"New Kids on the Block\" reteamed in 2007 in recording and book tours. The group received a Hollywood Walk of Fame star in 2014.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFormer 'New Kid On The Block', actor, brother of Mark Wahlberg\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000235/?ref_=ls_i_6)\n6. Uma Thurman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000235/?ref_=ls_t_6)\nActress\nProducer\nWriter\nKill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/?ref_=ls_knf_6)\nUma Karuna Thurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a highly\nunorthodox and internationally minded family. She is the daughter of\nNena Thurman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862200/?ls)\n(née Birgitte Caroline von\nSchlebrügge), a fashion model and socialite who now runs a mountain\nretreat, and of\nRobert Thurman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862201/?ls)\n(Robert Alexander Farrar Thurman), a professor and academic who is one\nof the nation's foremost Buddhist scholars. Uma's mother was born in\nMexico City, Mexico, to a German father and a Swedish mother (who\nherself was of Swedish, Danish, and German descent). Uma's father, a\nNew Yorker, has English, Scots-Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry.\nUma grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts, where her father worked at\nAmherst College.\nShe and her siblings all have names deriving from Buddhist mythology;\nand Middle American behavior was little understood, much less pursued.\nAnd so it was that the young Thurman confronted childhood with an odd\nname and eccentric home life -- and nature seemingly conspired against\nher as well. She is six feet tall, and from an early age towered over\neveryone else in class. Her famously large feet would soon sprout to\nsize 11 -- and even beyond that -- and although they would eventually\nbe lovingly filmed by director\nQuentin Tarantino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/?ls)\n, as a child she\ngenerally wore the biggest shoes in class, which only provided another\nsubject of ridicule. Even her long nose moved one of her mother's\nfriends to helpfully suggest rhinoplasty -- to the ten-year-old\nThurman. To make matters worse yet, the family constantly relocated,\nmaking the gangly, socially inept Thurman perpetually the new kid in\nclass. The result was an exceptionally awkward, self-conscious, lonely\nand alienated childhood.\nUnsurprisingly, the young Thurman enjoyed making believe she was\nsomeone other than herself, and so thrived at acting in school plays --\nher sole successful extracurricular activity. This interest, and her\nlanky frame, perfect for modeling, led the 15-year-old Thurman to New\nYork City for high school and modeling work (including a layout in\nGlamour Magazine) as she sought acting roles. The roles soon came,\nstarting with a few formulaic and forgettable Hollywood products, but\nimmediately followed by\nTerry Gilliam (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/?ls)\n's\nThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096764/?ls)\nand\nStephen Frears (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001241/?ls)\n'\nDangerous Liaisons (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/?ls)\n,\nboth of which brought much attention to her unorthodox sensuality and\nperformances that intriguingly combined innocence and worldliness. The\nweird, gangly girl became a sex symbol virtually overnight.\nThurman continued to be offered good roles in Hollywood pictures into\nthe early\n'90s, the least commercially successful but probably best-known of which was her smoldering, astonishingly-adult performance as June,\nHenry Miller (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588469/?ls)\n's\nwife, in\nHenry & June (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099762/?ls)\n, the\nfirst movie to actually receive the dreaded NC-17 rating in the USA.\nAfter a celebrated start, Thurman's career stalled in the early '90s\nwith movies such as the mediocre\nMad Dog and Glory (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107473/?ls)\n.\nWorse, her first starring role was in\nEven Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/?ls)\n,\nwhich had endured a tortured journey from cult-favorite book to\nbig-budget movie, and was a critical and financial debacle.\nFortunately, Uma bounced back with a brilliant performance as Mia\nWallace, that most unorthodox of all gangster's molls, in Tarantino's\nlauded, hugely successful\nPulp Fiction (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/?ls)\n, a role for\nwhich Thurman received an Academy Award nomination.\nSince then, Thurman has had periods of flirting with roles in arty\nindependents such as\nA Month by the Lake (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113849/?ls)\n,\nand supporting roles in which she has lent some glamorous presence to a\nmixed batch of movies, such as\nBeautiful Girls (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115639/?ls)\nand\nThe Truth About Cats & Dogs (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117979/?ls)\n.\nThurman returned to smaller films after playing the villainess Poison\nIvy in the reviled\nJoel Schumacher (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001708/?ls)\neffort\nBatman & Robin (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/?ls)\nand\nEmma Peel in a remake of\nThe Avengers (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118661/?ls)\n.

The\nrenewed attention was not altogether welcome because Thurman was\ndealing with the break-up of her marriage with Hawke at about this\ntime. Thurman handled the situation with grace, however, and took her\nsurging popularity in stride. She garnered critical acclaim for her\nwork in\nKill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/?ls)\nand\nwas hailed as Tarantino's muse.

While in high school, she felt left out and had low self-esteem because, at 6 feet, she was the tallest girl in school. After high school graduation, Geena entered New England College in New Hampshire and then transferred the next year to Boston University, where she majored in drama. In 1979, she dropped out and moved to New York to start her career. Her career consisted of sales clerk and waitress. She worked at Ann Taylor, where she eventually rose to Saturday window mannequin while trying to get a job with a modeling agency.

Her parents divorced when she was 10. She and her sister were raised by their mother. Her early interest was dance. To Bette, dancers led a glamorous life, but then she discovered the stage, and gave up dancing for acting. To her, it presented much more of a challenge.\nAfter graduation from Cushing Academy, she was refused admittance to\nEva Le Gallienne (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0499170/?ls)\n's Manhattan Civic Repertory. She enrolled in\nJohn Murray Anderson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0026960/?ls)\n's Dramatic School and was the star pupil. She was in the off-Broadway play \"The Earth Between\" (1923), and her Broadway debut in 1929 was in \"Broken Dishes\". She also appeared in \"Solid South\". Late in 1930, she was hired by Universal, where she made her first film, called\nBad Sister (1931) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021636/?ls)\n. When she arrived in Hollywood, the studio representative who went to meet her train left without her because he could find no one who looked like a movie star. An official at Universal complained she had \"as much sex appeal as\nSlim Summerville (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838843/?ls)\n\" and her performance in \"Bad Sister\" didn't impress.\nIn 1932, she signed a seven-year deal with Warner Brothers Pictures. Her first film with them was\nThe Man Who Played God (1932) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023181/?ls)\n. She became a star after this appearance, known as the actress that could play a variety of very strong and complex roles. More fairly successful movies followed, but it was the role of Mildred Rogers in RKO's\nOf Human Bondage (1934) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025586/?ls)\nthat would give Bette major acclaim from the film critics. She had a significant number of write-in votes for the Best Actress Oscar, but didn't win. Warner Bros. felt their seven-year deal with Bette was more than justified. They had a genuine star on their hands. With this success under her belt, she began pushing for stronger and more meaningful roles. In 1935, she received her first Oscar for her role in\nDangerous (1935) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026261/?ls)\nas Joyce Heath.\nIn 1936, she was suspended without pay for turning down a role that she deemed unworthy of her talent. She went to England, where she had planned to make movies, but was stopped by Warner Bros. because she was still under contract to them. They did not want her to work anywhere. Although she sued to get out of her contract, she lost. Still, they began to take her more seriously after that.\nReturning after losing her lawsuit, her roles improved dramatically. In 1938, Bette received a second Academy Award win for her work in\nJezebel (1938) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030287/?ls)\nopposite the soon-to-be-legendary\nHenry Fonda (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000020/?ls)\n. The only role she didn't get that she wanted was Scarlett O'Hara in\nGone with the Wind (1939) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031381/?ls)\n. Warners wouldn't loan her to\nDavid O. Selznick (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006388/?ls)\nunless he hired\nErrol Flynn (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001224/?ls)\nto play Rhett Butler,\nwhich both Selznick and Davis thought was a terrible choice. It was rumored she had numerous affairs, among them\nGeorge Brent (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0107575/?ls)\nand\nWilliam Wyler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943758/?ls)\n, and she was married four times, three of which ended in divorce. She admitted her career always came first.\nShe made many successful films in the 1940s, but each picture was weaker than the last and by the time her Warner Brothers contract had ended in 1949, she had been reduced to appearing in such films as the unintentionally hilarious\nBeyond the Forest (1949) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041172/?ls)\n. She made a huge comeback in 1950 when she replaced an ill\nClaudette Colbert (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001055/?ls)\nin, and\nreceived an Oscar nomination for,\nAll About Eve (1950) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042192/?ls)\n. She worked in films through the 1950s, but her career eventually came to a standstill, and in 1961 she placed a now famous Job Wanted ad in the trade papers.\nShe received an Oscar nomination for her role as a demented former child star in\nWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056687/?ls)\n. This brought about a new round of super-stardom for generations of fans who were not familiar with her work. Two years later, she starred in\nHush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058213/?ls)\n. Bette was married four times.\nIn 1977 she received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award and in 1979 she won a Best Actress Emmy for\nStrangers: The Story of a Mother and Daughter (1979) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079956/?ls)\n. In 1977-78 she moved from Connecticut to Los Angeles and filmed a pilot for the series\nHotel (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085032/?ls)\n, which she called Brothel. She refused to do the TV series and suffered a stroke during this time.\nHer last marriage, to actor\nGary Merrill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0581282/?ls)\n, lasted ten years, longer than any of the previous three. In 1985, her daughter Barbara Davis (\"B.D.\") Hyman published a scandalous book about Bette called \"My Mother's Keeper.\" Bette worked in the later 1980s in films and TV, even though a stroke had impaired her appearance and mobility. She wrote a book, \"This 'N That\", during her recovery from the stroke. Her last book was \"Bette Davis, The Lonely Life\", issued in paperback in 1990. It included an update from 1962 to 1989. She wrote the last chapter in San Sebastian, Spain.\nSadly, Bette Davis died on October 6, 1989, of metastasized breast cancer, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France.

Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.\nHe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is former U.S. Representative\nMike Capuano (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4576629/?ls)\n. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister,\nCarly Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2869049/?ls)\n, and two younger siblings, a brother named\nScott Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3268924/?ls)\n, who is also an actor, and a sister named\nShana Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4974640/?ls)\n. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the\nLee Strasberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833448/?ls)\nTheatre Institute.\nOn the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on\nThe Fugitive (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247097/?ls)\n(CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring\nHarrison Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/?ls)\n. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in\nCherry Falls (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175526/?ls)\nand\nThe Newcomers (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221431/?ls)\n- two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in\nBoston Public (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247081/?ls)\n(Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature,\nNot Another Teen Movie (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277371/?ls)\n, a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (\nChyler Leigh (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500200/?ls)\n) into prom queen.\nAfter filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful -\nJust Married (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305711/?ls)\nand\nEastwick (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362585/?ls)\n- he appeared in another listless teen comedy,\nThe Perfect Score (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314498/?ls)\n, playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\n, a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and\nKim Basinger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000107/?ls)\nas the damsel in distress,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\nfailed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in\nFantastic Four (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120667/?ls)\n, 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.\nThe year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance.\nThe Nanny Diaries (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489237/?ls)\n, where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie\nStreet Kings (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421073/?ls)\n, playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris.

Olympia Dukakis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001156/?ref_=ls_t_21)\nActress\nProducer\nMoonstruck (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093565/?ref_=ls_knf_21)\nLong a vital, respected thespian of the classic and contemporary stage, this grand lady did not become a household name and sought-after film actress until age 56 when she turned in a glorious, Oscar-winning performance as\nCher (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000333/?ls)\n's sardonic mother in the romantic comedy\nMoonstruck (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093565/?ls)\n. Movie (and TV) fans then discovered what East coast theater-going audiences had uncovered decades before -- Olympia Dukakis was an acting treasure. Her adaptability to various ethnicities (Greek, Italian, Jewish, Eastern European, etc.), as well her chameleon-like versatility in everything from cutting edge comedy to stark tragedy, kept her in high demand for 30 years as one of Hollywood's topnotch character players.\nOlympia Dukakis was born on June 20, 1931, in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Greek immigrants, Alexandra (Christos), from the Peloponnese, and Constantine S. Dukakis, from Anatolia. She majored in physical therapy at Boston University, where she graduated with a BA. Olympia practiced as a physical therapist during the polio epidemic. She later returned to her alma mater and entered the graduate program in performing arts, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree.\nOlympia found early success by distinguishing herself first on stage performing in summer stock and with several repertory and Shakespearean companies throughout the county. She made her Broadway debut as an understudy in \"The Aspern Papers\" at age 30, followed by very short runs in the plays \"Abraham Cochrane\" (1964) and \"Who's Who in Hell\" (1974). In 1999, she premiered a one-woman play \"Rose,\" at the National Theatre in London and subsequently on Broadway in 2000. The play earned her an Outer Critics Circle Award and Drama Desk Award nomination and she continues to tour the country with it.\nOlympia was seen on the New York stage in the Roundabout Theatre's production of \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\" (2011), in San Francisco in A.C.T.'s production of \"Vigil\" (2011) and as \"Prospera\" in \"The Tempest\" (2012) at Shakespeare & Co. She has performed in over 130 productions Off-Broadway and regionally at theaters including the Public Theatre, A.C.T., Shakespeare in the Park, Shakespeare & Co., and the Williamstown Summer Theatre Festival, where she also served as Associate Director. She was seen again at Shakespeare & Co. in the summer of 2013 as the title role in \"Mother Courage and Her Children.\"\nOlympia married Yugoslav-American actor\nLouis Zorich (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0957922/?ls)\nin 1962. The New York-based couple went on to co-found The Whole Theatre Company in Montclair, New Jersey, and ran the company for 19 years (1971-1990). As actress, director, producer and teacher, she still found the time to raise their three young children. She also became a master instructor at New York University for fourteen years. She scored theater triumphs in \"A Man's a Man,\" for which she won an Off-Broadway Obie Award in 1962; several productions of \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Mother Courage\"; \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\"; \"The Rose Tattoo\"; \"The Seagull\"; \"The Marriage of Bette and Boo\" (another Obie Award); and, more notably, her many performances as the title role in \"Hecuba.\" A good portion of her successes was launched within the walls of her own theater company, which encouraged the birth of new and untried plays.\nOlympia's prolific stage directing credits include many of the classics: \"Orpheus Descending,\" \"The House of Bernarda Alba,\" \"Uncle Vanya,\" and \"A Touch of the Poet,\" as well as the more contemporary (\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"Kennedy's Children\"). She also adapted such plays as \"Mother Courage\" and \"The Trojan Women\" for the theater company. Over the duration of their marriage, she and her husband have experienced shared successes, appearing together in \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" \"Camino Real, \"The Three Sisters\" and \"The Seagull,\" among many others. Both are master interpreters of Chekhovian plays -- one of their more recent acting collaborations was in \"The Chekhov Cycle\" in 2003.\nMaking an inauspicious debut in a bit role as a mental patient in\nLilith (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058294/?ls)\n, she tended to gravitate toward off-the-wall films with various offshoots of the ethnic mother. She played mom to such leads as\nDustin Hoffman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000163/?ls)\nin\nJohn and Mary (1969) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064513/?ls)\n,\nJoseph Bologna (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004767/?ls)\nin the cult comedy\nMade for Each Other (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067377/?ls)\nand\nRay Sharkey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788829/?ls)\nin\nThe Idolmaker (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080913/?ls)\n. Interestingly, it was her scene-stealing work on Broadway in the comedy \"Social Security\" (1986) that caught director\nNorman Jewison (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0422484/?ls)\n's eye and earned her the\nMoonstruck (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093565/?ls)\nmovie role. The Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actress was the last of a stream of awards she earned for that part, including the Los Angeles Film Critics, Golden Globe and American Comedy awards.\nFrom then on, silver-haired Olympia was frequently first in line for a number of cream-of-the-crop matron roles:\nSteel Magnolias (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098384/?ls)\n,\nDad (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097142/?ls)\n,\nLook Who's Talking (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097778/?ls)\n,\nThe Cemetery Club (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106536/?ls)\n,\nMr. Holland's Opus (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113862/?ls)\nand\nMother (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117090/?ls)\n.\nOn TV, she received high praise for her work especially for her sympathetic trans-gendered landlady Anna Madrigal in the acclaimed miniseries\nTales of the City (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106148/?ls)\nand its sequels\nMore Tales of the City (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120574/?ls)\n(Emmy Nominee) and\nFurther Tales of the City (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245625/?ls)\n.

He lost. But a seed was planted and he knew comedy was his\ncalling. College didn't seem to suit his growing fascination with\nstand-up comedy, and in 1986 he dropped out of college after only\nattending a single semester.\nIn 1993 he moved to Los Angeles and began performing comedy full time.\nIt didn't take long for the networks to take notice of him and in 1994,\nstarred in the Fox Television pilot, \"Howe High.\" From there he went on\nto a co-starring role as Barry Wallenstein on the WB series, \"Unhappily\nEver After,\" (Created by Ron Leavitt of Married with Children).\nThroughout his career, ANT has appeared on many series and specials\nincluding the remake of To Tell The Truth where he replaced Paula\nPoundstone as a regular celebrity panelist.

An odd and compelling beauty, she came from an upscale Bostonian family and was raised in the Hyde Park district.\nBorn February 3, 1965, the eldest child of three of Pat, a real estate agent, and Joseph M. Tierney, a prosperous politician and city councilman, Maura Lynn Tierney initially studied at New York University. She left school prior to graduation when she hooked up with the Circle-in-the-Square theater school. Following some stage plays including \"Baby with the Bathwater\" and \"Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,\" she moved to the West Coast in the late 1980s finding minor roles here and there in TV-movies and making the rounds on episodic shows such as\nGrowing Pains (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088527/?ls)\n,\nFamily Ties (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083413/?ls)\nand\nLaw & Order (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098844/?ls)\n.

A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for\nThe Departed (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/?ls)\nwho went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in\nThe Fighter (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964517/?ls)\n, Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in\nTed (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637725/?ls)\n.\nMark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), French-Canadian, English, Irish and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn't have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark's mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son's subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He'd spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.\nThe young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.\nAround this time, his older brother\nDonnie Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005531/?ls)\nhad become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band\nNew Kids on the Block (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578753/?ls)\n. A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.\nDonnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his \"Funky Bunch\" and \"Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch\" was born. His debut album, \"Music for the People\", was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper's willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping \"bad boy\". Record producer\nDavid Geffen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311691/?ls)\nsaw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer\nCalvin Klein (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0458681/?ls)\n, Marky Mark was set up as the designer's chief underwear model.\nHis scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the\nNew Kids on the Block (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578753/?ls)\n's fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, \"Marky Mark's\" bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with\nMadonna (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000187/?ls)\nand her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper\nShabba Ranks (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1133072/?ls)\n, he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, \"You Gotta Believe\", had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.\nAdding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the \"Marky Mark\" moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in\nPenny Marshall (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001508/?ls)\n's\nRenaissance Man (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110971/?ls)\n. Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In\nRenaissance Man (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110971/?ls)\n, he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial\nThe Basketball Diaries (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112461/?ls)\nand chilled them in\nFear (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116287/?ls)\nas every father's worst nightmare.\nThe major turning point in Wahlberg's career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in\nPaul Thomas Anderson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000759/?ls)\n's\nBoogie Nights (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/?ls)\n. Since then, Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability, starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as\nThree Kings (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120188/?ls)\nand\nThe Perfect Storm (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177971/?ls)\n, popcorn flicks like\nPlanet of the Apes (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133152/?ls)\nand\nContraband (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1524137/?ls)\n, and even indies such as\nI Heart Huckabees (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/?ls)\n.\nWahlberg was the executive producer of such television series as\nBoardwalk Empire (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979432/?ls)\n,\nIn Treatment (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0835434/?ls)\nand the highly successful comedy\nEntourage (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387199/?ls)\n, which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood.\nWahlberg and his wife\nRhea Durham (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1081113/?ls)\nhave four children.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nActor/director/producer megastar, former Calvin Klein model\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512934/?ref_=ls_i_67)\n67.

Ben has a younger brother, actor\nCasey Affleck (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000729/?ls)\n, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, Géza, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor.\nAffleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series,\nThe Voyage of the Mimi (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124265/?ls)\n. It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor,\nMatt Damon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/?ls)\n. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including\nHands of a Stranger (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093141/?ls)\nand\nThe Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278695/?ls)\n. He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in\nDazed and Confused (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106677/?ls)\n. After that, he did mostly independent films like\nKevin Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/?ls)\n's\nMallrats (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/?ls)\nand\nChasing Amy (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118842/?ls)\nwhich were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for\nGood Will Hunting (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/?ls)\n, they gave it to their agent,\nPatrick Whitesell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925877/?ls)\n, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend\nKevin Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/?ls)\nwho took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997,\nGood Will Hunting (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/?ls)\nwas released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.\nAffleck chose such roles in the blockbusters\nArmageddon (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/?ls)\n,\nShakespeare in Love (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138097/?ls)\n, and\nPearl Harbor (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213149/?ls)\n. In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits\nChanging Lanes (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264472/?ls)\n,\nThe Sum of All Fears (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164184/?ls)\n, and\nDaredevil (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287978/?ls)\n, as well as the disappointing comedies\nGigli (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299930/?ls)\nand\nSurviving Christmas (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252028/?ls)\n. While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in\nHollywoodland (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427969/?ls)\n.

Matt has an older brother, Kyle, a sculptor. His father was of English and Scottish descent, and his mother is of Finnish and Swedish ancestry. The family lived in Newton until his parents divorced in 1973, when Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community, and was raised near actor\nBen Affleck (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255/?ls)\n.\nDamon attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. He attended Harvard University as an English major.

It was until his film,\nGeronimo: An American Legend (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107004/?ls)\n, was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely. Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy,\nMystic Pizza (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095690/?ls)\n. However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in\nSchool Ties (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105327/?ls)\n.

With an Academy Award under his belt and a reputation as a powerful leading man, Casey Affleck has established himself as one of the most compelling and versatile actors in contemporary cinema. Throughout his career, he has consistently delivered performances of exceptional depth and nuance in a wide range of film genres.\nAffleck's breakout role came in Andrew Dominik's critically acclaimed character drama, \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" (2007). His performance as Robert Ford, a young man consumed by a complex cocktail of admiration and resentment for the notorious outlaw Jesse James (portrayed by Brad Pitt), earned him widespread recognition, including Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.\nHe solidified his critical acclaim with a starring role in his brother Ben Affleck's directorial debut, \"Gone, Baby, Gone\" (2007). This gripping neo-noir followed two Boston-based private detectives searching for an abducted young girl. Affleck's performance, showcasing both vulnerability and determination, further cemented his reputation as a rising dramatic force.\nThe following decade saw Affleck continue to diversify his roles, venturing outside the realm of independent drama to blockbuster productions. He was seen in Christopher Nolan's ambitious sci-fi epic \"Interstellar\" (2014) alongside an ensemble cast including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. Affleck also appeared in Scott Cooper's gritty crime thriller, \"Out of the Furnace\" (2013), where he shared the screen with Christian Bale.\nHis versatility continued to shine with his performance in the independent film \"Ain't Them Bodies Saints\" (2013), showcasing a quieter, more brooding side to his acting talents. That same year, Affleck turned his attention to production, establishing The Affleck/Middleton Project with John Powers Middleton as a platform to develop and produce a diverse array of film and television projects.\nAffleck's directorial work came to fruition with the release of the mockumentary \"I'm Still Here\" (2010), which he directed, wrote, and produced, featuring Joaquin Phoenix in a performance art piece that blurred the lines between fiction and reality. This experimental project demonstrated Affleck's willingness to challenge conventional storytelling formats.\nIn 2016, Affleck returned to the spotlight with his career-defining performance in Kenneth Lonergan's profoundly moving drama, \"Manchester by the Sea.\" His portrayal of Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken man coping with immense loss, earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. This raw and unforgettable performance cemented Affleck's status as one of the industry's finest dramatic actors.\n2016 also saw Affleck star in several other notable films, including the action thriller \"Triple 9\" (2016) and Disney's historical drama, \"The Finest Hours.\" He further expanded his range with roles in independent films like David Lowery's \"A Ghost Story\" (2017), a meditative exploration of loss and the passage of time.\nAffleck has continued to take on challenging projects that have pushed his boundaries as an actor. Most recently, he starred opposite Elisabeth Moss in the psychological thriller \"Light of My Life\" (2019), which he also wrote and directed.\nHis upcoming projects include a pivotal role in Christopher Nolan's highly-anticipated \"Oppenheimer\" (2023), where he portrays theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer himself. Affleck is also slated to star in \"Slingshot\" (2024), a science fiction thriller set in space.\nCasey Affleck's talent for embodying complex, flawed characters with profound authenticity has made him one of the most sought-after actors in the industry. With his captivating performances, dedication to his craft, and his discerning eye for unique storytelling projects, the future remains bright for this remarkable actor.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nStar of\nGone Baby Gone\n, film director, brother of Ben Affleck\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0898634/?ref_=ls_i_73)\n73.

However, Billy Batts is better known to a legion of crime-film fans as the talented actor, musician, and comedian Frank Vincent. He was born in North Adams, Massachusetts, but was raised in the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey. Frank studied music at St. Pauls Grammar School and became a keen drummer at a young age, while his father introduced him to the dramatic arts. Vincent went on to became quite an accomplished musician and played with some of the key 1960s recording artists including\nTrini López (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0530382/?ls)\n,\nDel Shannon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788272/?ls)\nand\nPaul Anka (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001912/?ls)\n.

With the recognition of his talents, various new opportunities work followed, and Frank lent his skills to contributing and appearing on video games, in television commercials and even rock-music clips with artists including DMX, T-Boz and Hype Williams. He also had the role of gangster Phil Leotardo in the legendary HBO series\nThe Sopranos (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141842/?ls)\n.\nFrank Vincent was also the proud recipient of the Italian American Entertainer of the Year Award, and was also acknowledged with a Lifetime Achievement Award presented by the Back East Picture Show.\nNorth Adams, Massachusetts\nCo-star in\nGoodfellas\n,\nCasino\n, and on HBO's\nThe Sopranos\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005531/?ref_=ls_i_74)\n74. Donnie Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005531/?ref_=ls_t_74)\nActor\nProducer\nComposer\nSaw II (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432348/?ref_=ls_knf_74)\nDonald Edmond \"Donnie\" Wahlberg Jr. was born on August 17, 1969 in Boston, Massachusetts into a family of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), Irish, and more distant French-Canadian, English, and Scottish, descent. He is the eighth of nine children of Alma Elaine Conroy (née Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk & Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. His parents eventually divorced and Donnie, finding himself already in trouble, discovered a positive outlet performing in school plays and became involved in varied aspects of theater -- acting, writing, and directing. At 15, he became a member of the teen vocal group originally called NYNUK. Donnie's little brother,\nMark Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000242/?ls)\nwas originally one of the Boys but balked at the direction the group was taking and backed out.\nA founding member of the boy band \"New Kids on the Block,\" the five teens survived a false start with their debut album and proceeded to hit #1 with the single \"Please Don't Go Girl\" on their second in 1988. They continued to bombard the market with one-after-another \"Top Ten\" hits including \"The Right Stuff\" and \"I'll Be Loving You Forever.\" Leaving the young girls panting for more, they became one of the hottest young singing/line-dancing groups to hit the late 80s/early 90s. The Boys went on to sell over 70 million albums worldwide, and provoke the spawning of other five-member harmony groups such as Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. During its heyday, Donnie played up his resident \"bad boy\" persona by tallying up several run-ins with the law, including an alleged arson at a Kentucky hotel (charges were dropped). He also delved into \"body art\" with numerous tattoos and body piercings in an effort to buck their already-cloying image. Amid intergroup dissension and Milli Vanilli-like charges of not contributing all the vocals to their albums, the pop band finally disbanded in 1994 -- partly out of frustration but also having outgrown the group's juvenile moniker.\nUnsure of his direction while attracting more trouble in the tabloids, Donnie, who helped write, arrange and produce brother Mark's Funky Bunch group's first two albums a few years earlier, switched gears. He rapped some and modeled some, then transformed himself into an actor, a route taken earlier by his talented bro. While Mark has turned out to become the bigger film star over the years, Donnie has stepped out of his shadows to receive raves and renewed respect for his own tense and compelling character work.\nHe first showed up in big screen action. Making his debut as a \"tough guy\" thug in the\nMickey Rourke (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000620/?ls)\nurban outing\nBullet (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115781/?ls)\n, filmed in 1994 but not released until two years later. Usually cast as an amoral heavy, Donnie moved up the quality ladder with director\nRon Howard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/?ls)\n's thriller\nRansom (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117438/?ls)\nas part of a gang of kidnappers who nab\nMel Gibson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000154/?ls)\n's son, to their eventual regret, of course. His next repellent took the form of a drug dealer in the goth indie horror\nBlack Circle Boys (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118730/?ls)\n, but the film came and went. After a couple of TV movies, he finally nabbed a starring role in the film\nSouthie (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118766/?ls)\nplaying more or less himself as an Irish-American prodigal son who returns to the mean streets of his native Boston. The movie also featured another brother\nRobert Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906301/?ls)\nwho also was testing the acting waters.\nIronically, one of Donnie's most powerful roles during this period was also one of his briefest. Seen in the opening sequence, he is nearly unrecognizable (having dropped an alarming amount of weight) portraying a deranged former patient of psychiatrist\nBruce Willis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/?ls)\nwhose sudden explosion into unfathomable violence sets up the clever twists and turns that turned\nM.

Donnie's opening bit was mouth dropping and jarring in its horror. He also proved he wasn't a flash in the pan by backing up this performance with a major role as a WWII paratrooper in the critically-hailed ten-part epic\nBand of Brothers (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/?ls)\n, which won multiple Emmy awards (6).\nThis TV role directly led to his casting as a gritty L.A. detective in the NBC dramatic series\nBoomtown (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319960/?ls)\n, an acclaimed series that didn't survive a second season. Since then Donnie has patented his unrefined intensity into a number of films such as\nTriggermen (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283077/?ls)\n,\nDreamcatcher (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285531/?ls)\n,\nSaw II (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432348/?ls)\n,\nAnnapolis (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417433/?ls)\n,\nSaw III (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489270/?ls)\n,\nSaw IV (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0890870/?ls)\nand\nZookeeper (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1222817/?ls)\n. He has also clocked in lead roles for such roughhewn TV series as\nRunaway (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805665/?ls)\n,\nThe Kill Point (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862593/?ls)\n,\nReturn of the Mac (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6329316/?ls)\nand, most notably, as detective Danny Reagan in\nBlue Bloods (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1595859/?ls)\n.\nDonny has two sons, Xavier and Elijah, by first wife Kim Fey, and is married to actress/producer/writer\nJenny McCarthy-Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000189/?ls)\n.

Uma Thurman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000235/?ref_=ls_t_76)\nActress\nProducer\nWriter\nKill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/?ref_=ls_knf_76)\nUma Karuna Thurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a highly\nunorthodox and internationally minded family. She is the daughter of\nNena Thurman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862200/?ls)\n(née Birgitte Caroline von\nSchlebrügge), a fashion model and socialite who now runs a mountain\nretreat, and of\nRobert Thurman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862201/?ls)\n(Robert Alexander Farrar Thurman), a professor and academic who is one\nof the nation's foremost Buddhist scholars. Uma's mother was born in\nMexico City, Mexico, to a German father and a Swedish mother (who\nherself was of Swedish, Danish, and German descent). Uma's father, a\nNew Yorker, has English, Scots-Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry.\nUma grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts, where her father worked at\nAmherst College.\nShe and her siblings all have names deriving from Buddhist mythology;\nand Middle American behavior was little understood, much less pursued.\nAnd so it was that the young Thurman confronted childhood with an odd\nname and eccentric home life -- and nature seemingly conspired against\nher as well. She is six feet tall, and from an early age towered over\neveryone else in class. Her famously large feet would soon sprout to\nsize 11 -- and even beyond that -- and although they would eventually\nbe lovingly filmed by director\nQuentin Tarantino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/?ls)\n, as a child she\ngenerally wore the biggest shoes in class, which only provided another\nsubject of ridicule. Even her long nose moved one of her mother's\nfriends to helpfully suggest rhinoplasty -- to the ten-year-old\nThurman. To make matters worse yet, the family constantly relocated,\nmaking the gangly, socially inept Thurman perpetually the new kid in\nclass. The result was an exceptionally awkward, self-conscious, lonely\nand alienated childhood.\nUnsurprisingly, the young Thurman enjoyed making believe she was\nsomeone other than herself, and so thrived at acting in school plays --\nher sole successful extracurricular activity. This interest, and her\nlanky frame, perfect for modeling, led the 15-year-old Thurman to New\nYork City for high school and modeling work (including a layout in\nGlamour Magazine) as she sought acting roles. The roles soon came,\nstarting with a few formulaic and forgettable Hollywood products, but\nimmediately followed by\nTerry Gilliam (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/?ls)\n's\nThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096764/?ls)\nand\nStephen Frears (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001241/?ls)\n'\nDangerous Liaisons (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/?ls)\n,\nboth of which brought much attention to her unorthodox sensuality and\nperformances that intriguingly combined innocence and worldliness. The\nweird, gangly girl became a sex symbol virtually overnight.\nThurman continued to be offered good roles in Hollywood pictures into\nthe early\n'90s, the least commercially successful but probably best-known of which was her smoldering, astonishingly-adult performance as June,\nHenry Miller (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588469/?ls)\n's\nwife, in\nHenry & June (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099762/?ls)\n, the\nfirst movie to actually receive the dreaded NC-17 rating in the USA.\nAfter a celebrated start, Thurman's career stalled in the early '90s\nwith movies such as the mediocre\nMad Dog and Glory (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107473/?ls)\n.\nWorse, her first starring role was in\nEven Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/?ls)\n,\nwhich had endured a tortured journey from cult-favorite book to\nbig-budget movie, and was a critical and financial debacle.\nFortunately, Uma bounced back with a brilliant performance as Mia\nWallace, that most unorthodox of all gangster's molls, in Tarantino's\nlauded, hugely successful\nPulp Fiction (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/?ls)\n, a role for\nwhich Thurman received an Academy Award nomination.\nSince then, Thurman has had periods of flirting with roles in arty\nindependents such as\nA Month by the Lake (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113849/?ls)\n,\nand supporting roles in which she has lent some glamorous presence to a\nmixed batch of movies, such as\nBeautiful Girls (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115639/?ls)\nand\nThe Truth About Cats & Dogs (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117979/?ls)\n.\nThurman returned to smaller films after playing the villainess Poison\nIvy in the reviled\nJoel Schumacher (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001708/?ls)\neffort\nBatman & Robin (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/?ls)\nand\nEmma Peel in a remake of\nThe Avengers (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118661/?ls)\n.

Thurman also won\na Golden Globe award for her turn in the made-for-television film\nHysterical Blindness (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290664/?ls)\n,\ndirected by\nMira Nair (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619762/?ls)\n.\nA return to the mainstream spotlight came when Thurman re-teamed with\nQuentin Tarantino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/?ls)\nfor\nKill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/?ls)\n, a\nrevenge flick the two had dreamed up on the set of\nPulp Fiction (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/?ls)\n. She also turned\nup in the\nJohn Woo (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000247/?ls)\ncautioner\nPaycheck (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338337/?ls)\nthat same year. The\nrenewed attention was not altogether welcome because Thurman was\ndealing with the break-up of her marriage with Hawke at about this\ntime. Thurman handled the situation with grace, however, and took her\nsurging popularity in stride. She garnered critical acclaim for her\nwork in\nKill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/?ls)\nand\nwas hailed as Tarantino's muse. Thurman reunited with\nPulp Fiction (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/?ls)\ndance partner\nJohn Travolta (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000237/?ls)\nfor the\nGet Shorty (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113161/?ls)\nsequel\nBe Cool (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377471/?ls)\nand played Ulla in\nThe Producers (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395251/?ls)\n.\nThurman had been briefly married to\nGary Oldman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000198/?ls)\n, from 1990 to 1992.

While in high school, she felt left out and had low self-esteem because, at 6 feet, she was the tallest girl in school. After high school graduation, Geena entered New England College in New Hampshire and then transferred the next year to Boston University, where she majored in drama. In 1979, she dropped out and moved to New York to start her career. Her career consisted of sales clerk and waitress. She worked at Ann Taylor, where she eventually rose to Saturday window mannequin while trying to get a job with a modeling agency. Eventually signed by the Zoli Agency, she wound up as a model in the Victoria Secret's Catalogue. Ever vigilant,\nSydney Pollack (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001628/?ls)\nwas looking for new talent in the catalog when he spotted Geena and cast her in\nTootsie (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084805/?ls)\n. With good reviews, Geena moved to Los Angeles where she was cast as Wendy in the short-lived but critically acclaimed television series\nBuffalo Bill (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084992/?ls)\nwith\nDabney Coleman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001056/?ls)\n. Her next appearance on television was in her own series\nSara (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088599/?ls)\n, which was also good, but soon canceled. Geena then returned to the big screen in the below-average\nTransylvania 6-5000 (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090196/?ls)\nfollowed by the successful\nChevy Chase (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000331/?ls)\nmovie\nFletch (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089155/?ls)\n.

Then she married director\nRenny Harlin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001317/?ls)\nand they set up a production and development company called \"The Forge.\" Their first film was\nSpeechless (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111256/?ls)\n, which flopped at the box office. Undeterred, Renny decided to film the big-budget\nCutthroat Island (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112760/?ls)\n, starring Geena as pirate leader Morgan, which also flopped. Geena has since starred in the thriller\nThe Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116908/?ls)\nand played Eleanor Little in\nStuart Little (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164912/?ls)\nand\nStuart Little 2 (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243585/?ls)\n.

Her parents divorced when she was 10. She and her sister were raised by their mother. Her early interest was dance. To Bette, dancers led a glamorous life, but then she discovered the stage, and gave up dancing for acting. To her, it presented much more of a challenge.\nAfter graduation from Cushing Academy, she was refused admittance to\nEva Le Gallienne (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0499170/?ls)\n's Manhattan Civic Repertory. She enrolled in\nJohn Murray Anderson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0026960/?ls)\n's Dramatic School and was the star pupil. She was in the off-Broadway play \"The Earth Between\" (1923), and her Broadway debut in 1929 was in \"Broken Dishes\". She also appeared in \"Solid South\". Late in 1930, she was hired by Universal, where she made her first film, called\nBad Sister (1931) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021636/?ls)\n. When she arrived in Hollywood, the studio representative who went to meet her train left without her because he could find no one who looked like a movie star. An official at Universal complained she had \"as much sex appeal as\nSlim Summerville (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838843/?ls)\n\" and her performance in \"Bad Sister\" didn't impress.\nIn 1932, she signed a seven-year deal with Warner Brothers Pictures. Her first film with them was\nThe Man Who Played God (1932) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023181/?ls)\n. She became a star after this appearance, known as the actress that could play a variety of very strong and complex roles. More fairly successful movies followed, but it was the role of Mildred Rogers in RKO's\nOf Human Bondage (1934) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025586/?ls)\nthat would give Bette major acclaim from the film critics. She had a significant number of write-in votes for the Best Actress Oscar, but didn't win. Warner Bros. felt their seven-year deal with Bette was more than justified. They had a genuine star on their hands. With this success under her belt, she began pushing for stronger and more meaningful roles. In 1935, she received her first Oscar for her role in\nDangerous (1935) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026261/?ls)\nas Joyce Heath.\nIn 1936, she was suspended without pay for turning down a role that she deemed unworthy of her talent. She went to England, where she had planned to make movies, but was stopped by Warner Bros. because she was still under contract to them. They did not want her to work anywhere. Although she sued to get out of her contract, she lost. Still, they began to take her more seriously after that.\nReturning after losing her lawsuit, her roles improved dramatically. In 1938, Bette received a second Academy Award win for her work in\nJezebel (1938) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030287/?ls)\nopposite the soon-to-be-legendary\nHenry Fonda (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000020/?ls)\n. The only role she didn't get that she wanted was Scarlett O'Hara in\nGone with the Wind (1939) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031381/?ls)\n. Warners wouldn't loan her to\nDavid O. Selznick (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006388/?ls)\nunless he hired\nErrol Flynn (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001224/?ls)\nto play Rhett Butler,\nwhich both Selznick and Davis thought was a terrible choice. It was rumored she had numerous affairs, among them\nGeorge Brent (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0107575/?ls)\nand\nWilliam Wyler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943758/?ls)\n, and she was married four times, three of which ended in divorce. She admitted her career always came first.\nShe made many successful films in the 1940s, but each picture was weaker than the last and by the time her Warner Brothers contract had ended in 1949, she had been reduced to appearing in such films as the unintentionally hilarious\nBeyond the Forest (1949) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041172/?ls)\n. She made a huge comeback in 1950 when she replaced an ill\nClaudette Colbert (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001055/?ls)\nin, and\nreceived an Oscar nomination for,\nAll About Eve (1950) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042192/?ls)\n. She worked in films through the 1950s, but her career eventually came to a standstill, and in 1961 she placed a now famous Job Wanted ad in the trade papers.\nShe received an Oscar nomination for her role as a demented former child star in\nWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056687/?ls)\n. This brought about a new round of super-stardom for generations of fans who were not familiar with her work. Two years later, she starred in\nHush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058213/?ls)\n. Bette was married four times.\nIn 1977 she received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award and in 1979 she won a Best Actress Emmy for\nStrangers: The Story of a Mother and Daughter (1979) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079956/?ls)\n. In 1977-78 she moved from Connecticut to Los Angeles and filmed a pilot for the series\nHotel (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085032/?ls)\n, which she called Brothel. She refused to do the TV series and suffered a stroke during this time.\nHer last marriage, to actor\nGary Merrill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0581282/?ls)\n, lasted ten years, longer than any of the previous three. In 1985, her daughter Barbara Davis (\"B.D.\") Hyman published a scandalous book about Bette called \"My Mother's Keeper.\" Bette worked in the later 1980s in films and TV, even though a stroke had impaired her appearance and mobility. She wrote a book, \"This 'N That\", during her recovery from the stroke. Her last book was \"Bette Davis, The Lonely Life\", issued in paperback in 1990. It included an update from 1962 to 1989. She wrote the last chapter in San Sebastian, Spain.\nSadly, Bette Davis died on October 6, 1989, of metastasized breast cancer, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France. Many of her fans refused to believe she was gone.\nLowell, Massachusetts\nFilm superstar and cultural icon. 1908 - 1989\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001860/?ref_=ls_i_91)\n91.

She will next be seen starring opposite Nicholas Cage in the thriller Longlegs, set for a 2024 worldwide theatrical release. She also just appeared on Fox's The Masked Singer as Dandelion, winning her first episode with her rendition of Over The Rainbow. Recent sightings include psychological drama Fuzzy Head (2023); I Care A Lot (2021) on Netflix, starring Rosamund Pike and Dianne Wiest; as a killer in Lifetime Network's true crime drama The Disappearance of Cari Farver (2022) and as Zelda on the final season of Orange Is The New Black.\nAlicia is also a familiar face to Christmas audiences for her 10 holiday movies, many of which have featured her original music and continue to air every year.\nWitt spent 5 weeks in the Billboard Top 30 AC Radio chart with her single Chasing Shadows, off her 2021 album The Conduit, which she co-produced alongside Jordan Lehning and Bill Reynolds. Her newest release is 2023's Witness, led by the title track, which debuted in April. A classically trained former competitive pianist, Alicia's music has been described as 'sharply personal, boldly melodic pop originals in the Carole King/Billy Joel vein' and 'touching lost-and-found love ballads' (Philadelphia Inquirer).\nWitt's many films include Two Weeks' Notice, Last Holiday, The Upside of Anger, Mr. Holland's Opus, Urban Legend, Four Rooms, 88 Minutes, Vanilla Sky, and Fun, for which she was awarded the Special Jury Recognition Award from the Sundance Film Festival, and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.\nAlicia received rave reviews for her role as Paula in Season 6 of AMC's critically acclaimed series The Walking Dead. Witt also appeared during Season 4 of ABC's 'Nashville' as country star Autumn Chase and in Season 3 of David Lynch's Twin Peaks on Showtime, reprising her role from the original as Gerstein Hayward.

Her 2018 release, 15000 Days, was produced by Grammy-winning producer Jacquire King (James Bay, Norah Jones, Kings of Leon, Dawes). Witt's previous album, Revisionary History, was produced by Ben Folds and was hailed as 'Grey Seal era Elton John, an alt-universe Fiona Apple, and a film noir chanteuse notching her nights in cigarette burns on the fallboard' (Nashville Scene).\nWitt's first book, Small Changes, came out in Fall 2021 from Harper Horizon. The book is an inspiring, welcoming and simple yet effective guide to health, happiness and sustainable living. Instead of promoting a rigid diet, Small Changes offers readers a stress-and-judgment-free approach for enacting easy, incremental changes across all areas of life.\nOn stage, Witt starred in Neil LaBute's Tony nominated play Reasons to Be Pretty at the Geffen Playhouse. She also appeared at London's Royal Court theatre in Terry Johnson's Piano/Forte and made her West End debut with The Shape of Things.

Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.\nHe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is former U.S. Representative\nMike Capuano (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4576629/?ls)\n. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister,\nCarly Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2869049/?ls)\n, and two younger siblings, a brother named\nScott Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3268924/?ls)\n, who is also an actor, and a sister named\nShana Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4974640/?ls)\n. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the\nLee Strasberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833448/?ls)\nTheatre Institute.\nOn the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on\nThe Fugitive (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247097/?ls)\n(CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring\nHarrison Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/?ls)\n. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in\nCherry Falls (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175526/?ls)\nand\nThe Newcomers (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221431/?ls)\n- two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in\nBoston Public (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247081/?ls)\n(Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature,\nNot Another Teen Movie (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277371/?ls)\n, a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (\nChyler Leigh (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500200/?ls)\n) into prom queen.\nAfter filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful -\nJust Married (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305711/?ls)\nand\nEastwick (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362585/?ls)\n- he appeared in another listless teen comedy,\nThe Perfect Score (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314498/?ls)\n, playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\n, a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and\nKim Basinger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000107/?ls)\nas the damsel in distress,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\nfailed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in\nFantastic Four (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120667/?ls)\n, 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.\nThe year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance.\nThe Nanny Diaries (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489237/?ls)\n, where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie\nStreet Kings (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421073/?ls)\n, playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris.

Movie (and TV) fans then discovered what East coast theater-going audiences had uncovered decades before -- Olympia Dukakis was an acting treasure. Her adaptability to various ethnicities (Greek, Italian, Jewish, Eastern European, etc.), as well her chameleon-like versatility in everything from cutting edge comedy to stark tragedy, kept her in high demand for 30 years as one of Hollywood's topnotch character players.\nOlympia Dukakis was born on June 20, 1931, in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Greek immigrants, Alexandra (Christos), from the Peloponnese, and Constantine S. Dukakis, from Anatolia. She majored in physical therapy at Boston University, where she graduated with a BA. Olympia practiced as a physical therapist during the polio epidemic. She later returned to her alma mater and entered the graduate program in performing arts, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree.\nOlympia found early success by distinguishing herself first on stage performing in summer stock and with several repertory and Shakespearean companies throughout the county. She made her Broadway debut as an understudy in \"The Aspern Papers\" at age 30, followed by very short runs in the plays \"Abraham Cochrane\" (1964) and \"Who's Who in Hell\" (1974). In 1999, she premiered a one-woman play \"Rose,\" at the National Theatre in London and subsequently on Broadway in 2000. The play earned her an Outer Critics Circle Award and Drama Desk Award nomination and she continues to tour the country with it.\nOlympia was seen on the New York stage in the Roundabout Theatre's production of \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\" (2011), in San Francisco in A.C.T.'s production of \"Vigil\" (2011) and as \"Prospera\" in \"The Tempest\" (2012) at Shakespeare & Co. She has performed in over 130 productions Off-Broadway and regionally at theaters including the Public Theatre, A.C.T., Shakespeare in the Park, Shakespeare & Co., and the Williamstown Summer Theatre Festival, where she also served as Associate Director. She was seen again at Shakespeare & Co. in the summer of 2013 as the title role in \"Mother Courage and Her Children.\"\nOlympia married Yugoslav-American actor\nLouis Zorich (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0957922/?ls)\nin 1962. The New York-based couple went on to co-found The Whole Theatre Company in Montclair, New Jersey, and ran the company for 19 years (1971-1990). As actress, director, producer and teacher, she still found the time to raise their three young children. She also became a master instructor at New York University for fourteen years. She scored theater triumphs in \"A Man's a Man,\" for which she won an Off-Broadway Obie Award in 1962; several productions of \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Mother Courage\"; \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\"; \"The Rose Tattoo\"; \"The Seagull\"; \"The Marriage of Bette and Boo\" (another Obie Award); and, more notably, her many performances as the title role in \"Hecuba.\" A good portion of her successes was launched within the walls of her own theater company, which encouraged the birth of new and untried plays.\nOlympia's prolific stage directing credits include many of the classics: \"Orpheus Descending,\" \"The House of Bernarda Alba,\" \"Uncle Vanya,\" and \"A Touch of the Poet,\" as well as the more contemporary (\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"Kennedy's Children\"). She also adapted such plays as \"Mother Courage\" and \"The Trojan Women\" for the theater company. Over the duration of their marriage, she and her husband have experienced shared successes, appearing together in \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" \"Camino Real, \"The Three Sisters\" and \"The Seagull,\" among many others. Both are master interpreters of Chekhovian plays -- one of their more recent acting collaborations was in \"The Chekhov Cycle\" in 2003.\nMaking an inauspicious debut in a bit role as a mental patient in\nLilith (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058294/?ls)\n, she tended to gravitate toward off-the-wall films with various offshoots of the ethnic mother. She played mom to such leads as\nDustin Hoffman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000163/?ls)\nin\nJohn and Mary (1969) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064513/?ls)\n,\nJoseph Bologna (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004767/?ls)\nin the cult comedy\nMade for Each Other (1971) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067377/?ls)\nand\nRay Sharkey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788829/?ls)\nin\nThe Idolmaker (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080913/?ls)\n. Interestingly, it was her scene-stealing work on Broadway in the comedy \"Social Security\" (1986) that caught director\nNorman Jewison (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0422484/?ls)\n's eye and earned her the\nMoonstruck (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093565/?ls)\nmovie role. The Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actress was the last of a stream of awards she earned for that part, including the Los Angeles Film Critics, Golden Globe and American Comedy awards.\nFrom then on, silver-haired Olympia was frequently first in line for a number of cream-of-the-crop matron roles:\nSteel Magnolias (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098384/?ls)\n,\nDad (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097142/?ls)\n,\nLook Who's Talking (1989) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097778/?ls)\n,\nThe Cemetery Club (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106536/?ls)\n,\nMr. Holland's Opus (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113862/?ls)\nand\nMother (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117090/?ls)\n.\nOn TV, she received high praise for her work especially for her sympathetic trans-gendered landlady Anna Madrigal in the acclaimed miniseries\nTales of the City (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106148/?ls)\nand its sequels\nMore Tales of the City (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120574/?ls)\n(Emmy Nominee) and\nFurther Tales of the City (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245625/?ls)\n. She was additionally seen in episodes of\nBored to Death (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2318413/?ls)\n, and TV movies\nThe Last of the Blonde Bombshells (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0220608/?ls)\n(Judi Dench),\nSinatra (1992) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105413/?ls)\n(Golden Globe Nominee), and\nThe Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151137/?ls)\n(Emmy Nominee).

Moreover, she was a strong advocate of women's rights and environmental causes. Olympia published her best-selling autobiography \"Ask Me Again Tomorrow: A Life in Progress\" in 2003, an introspective chronicle full of her trademark candor and wry humor.

A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for\nThe Departed (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/?ls)\nwho went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in\nThe Fighter (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964517/?ls)\n, Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in\nTed (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637725/?ls)\n.\nMark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), French-Canadian, English, Irish and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn't have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark's mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son's subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He'd spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.\nThe young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.\nAround this time, his older brother\nDonnie Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005531/?ls)\nhad become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band\nNew Kids on the Block (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578753/?ls)\n. A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.\nDonnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his \"Funky Bunch\" and \"Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch\" was born. His debut album, \"Music for the People\", was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper's willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping \"bad boy\". Record producer\nDavid Geffen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311691/?ls)\nsaw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer\nCalvin Klein (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0458681/?ls)\n, Marky Mark was set up as the designer's chief underwear model.\nHis scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the\nNew Kids on the Block (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578753/?ls)\n's fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, \"Marky Mark's\" bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with\nMadonna (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000187/?ls)\nand her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper\nShabba Ranks (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1133072/?ls)\n, he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, \"You Gotta Believe\", had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.\nAdding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the \"Marky Mark\" moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in\nPenny Marshall (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001508/?ls)\n's\nRenaissance Man (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110971/?ls)\n. Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In\nRenaissance Man (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110971/?ls)\n, he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial\nThe Basketball Diaries (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112461/?ls)\nand chilled them in\nFear (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116287/?ls)\nas every father's worst nightmare.\nThe major turning point in Wahlberg's career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in\nPaul Thomas Anderson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000759/?ls)\n's\nBoogie Nights (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/?ls)\n. Since then, Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability, starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as\nThree Kings (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120188/?ls)\nand\nThe Perfect Storm (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177971/?ls)\n, popcorn flicks like\nPlanet of the Apes (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133152/?ls)\nand\nContraband (2012) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1524137/?ls)\n, and even indies such as\nI Heart Huckabees (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/?ls)\n.\nWahlberg was the executive producer of such television series as\nBoardwalk Empire (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979432/?ls)\n,\nIn Treatment (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0835434/?ls)\nand the highly successful comedy\nEntourage (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387199/?ls)\n, which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood.\nWahlberg and his wife\nRhea Durham (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1081113/?ls)\nhave four children.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nActor/director/producer megastar, former Calvin Klein model\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068551/?ref_=ls_i_113)\n113.

Ben has a younger brother, actor\nCasey Affleck (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000729/?ls)\n, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, Géza, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor.\nAffleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series,\nThe Voyage of the Mimi (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124265/?ls)\n. It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor,\nMatt Damon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/?ls)\n. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including\nHands of a Stranger (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093141/?ls)\nand\nThe Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278695/?ls)\n. He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in\nDazed and Confused (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106677/?ls)\n. After that, he did mostly independent films like\nKevin Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/?ls)\n's\nMallrats (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/?ls)\nand\nChasing Amy (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118842/?ls)\nwhich were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for\nGood Will Hunting (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/?ls)\n, they gave it to their agent,\nPatrick Whitesell (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925877/?ls)\n, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend\nKevin Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/?ls)\nwho took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997,\nGood Will Hunting (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/?ls)\nwas released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.\nAffleck chose such roles in the blockbusters\nArmageddon (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/?ls)\n,\nShakespeare in Love (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138097/?ls)\n, and\nPearl Harbor (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213149/?ls)\n.

While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in\nHollywoodland (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427969/?ls)\n. In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films\nSmokin' Aces (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475394/?ls)\n,\nHe's Just Not That Into You (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001508/?ls)\n,\nState of Play (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473705/?ls)\n, and\nExtract (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1225822/?ls)\n.

He is an actor, comedian , host, producer and\nwriter. In July 1993, he legally changed his name to ANT from Anthony\nSteven Kalloniatis. The correct orthography is ANT, spelled in all\ncaps.\nBorn to Greek immigrant parents (Lee and Maria - whom he talks about\nfrequently in his stand-up routines), Ant was raised strict Greek\nOrthodox. As he entered adulthood he ventured away from strict\nOrthodoxy and studied many other religions including Taoism, Hinduism\nand even Scientology. ANT believes that he is just a spiritual being\nlooking for answers.\nANT attended Londonderry High School and the University of New\nHampshire where he was affectionately known as \"what's your name\nagain?\" Inebriated at a bar one night, he got up on stage at a local\ntalent contest and performed a crude stand-up routine for the first\ntime. He lost. But a seed was planted and he knew comedy was his\ncalling. College didn't seem to suit his growing fascination with\nstand-up comedy, and in 1986 he dropped out of college after only\nattending a single semester.\nIn 1993 he moved to Los Angeles and began performing comedy full time.\nIt didn't take long for the networks to take notice of him and in 1994,\nstarred in the Fox Television pilot, \"Howe High.\" From there he went on\nto a co-starring role as Barry Wallenstein on the WB series, \"Unhappily\nEver After,\" (Created by Ron Leavitt of Married with Children).\nThroughout his career, ANT has appeared on many series and specials\nincluding the remake of To Tell The Truth where he replaced Paula\nPoundstone as a regular celebrity panelist. Other shows include;\nTosh.0, America's Next Top Model, The Insider, Kathy Griffin: My life\non the D list, The Jamie Foxx Show, For your love, Son of a beach, Gene\nSimmons: Family Jewels, Sweet Valley High, Queer as Folk, Weekends at\nthe DL, Nightstand, The Dennis Miller Show, But Can They Sing, Steve\nHarvey's Big Time, The Tyra Banks show, Comics Unleashed and many\nothers.\nHis big opportunity came with NBC's Last Comic Standing. A weekly\nreality show featuring stand-up comedians competing to be crowned the\nfunniest comic in America. Over 10,000 comedians tried out. ANT\nadvanced all the way to the semi-finals in Las Vegas but did not make\nit into the house. The second season, he made it into the house and was\n6th runner up out of hundreds of thousands of comedians. Then NBC\nordered a third season of LCS, and the format was changed slightly.\nSeason one would do battle against season two in LCS: The Battle of the\nBest. With ANT's hilarious help season (2) easily bested season one and\nwent on to win every head to head challenge and ultimately the\ncompetition.\nHe used that forward momentum parlaying it into a hosting job on the\nVH1 series, Celebrity Fit Club. He has been the host of the hit series\nfor 6 of its 7 unprecedented seasons (no other VH1 series has gone on\nto 7 seasons). That year he also released his hit live performance DVD\nentitled, \"ANT: America's Ready\".\nIn 1997, ANT moved out of his comfort zone, becoming a celebrity\nparticipant on the VH1 series, CelebraCadabra (magic with the stars).\nThere he revealed a deep rooted fear of clowns. He was eliminated 2nd\nwhen dressed as a grocery store candy aisle; he was mauled by a\nrambunctious group of 2nd graders all vying for something sweet. After\nhis departure from the series, the ratings tumbled and VH1 brought ANT\nback in subsequent episodes to appease angry fans.\nOver his career, ANT has appeared on numerous occasions on the Tonight\nShow with Jay Leno (9 times), The Howard Stern Radio show, and garnered\nhis own series on MTV Network's Logo Channel which bears his name: The\nU.S of ANT.\nIn features, he can be seen in Twin Falls, Idaho, I am Comic, Circuit,\nAngels Baby!, Another Gay Movie, National Lampoon's Totally Baked, The\nUnderground Comedy Movie (with Michael Clarke Duncan), and Sister Mary.\nHe has 3 siblings, Andrea, Althea and Frank.

With an Academy Award under his belt and a reputation as a powerful leading man, Casey Affleck has established himself as one of the most compelling and versatile actors in contemporary cinema.

His performance as Robert Ford, a young man consumed by a complex cocktail of admiration and resentment for the notorious outlaw Jesse James (portrayed by Brad Pitt), earned him widespread recognition, including Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.\nHe solidified his critical acclaim with a starring role in his brother Ben Affleck's directorial debut, \"Gone, Baby, Gone\" (2007). This gripping neo-noir followed two Boston-based private detectives searching for an abducted young girl. Affleck's performance, showcasing both vulnerability and determination, further cemented his reputation as a rising dramatic force.\nThe following decade saw Affleck continue to diversify his roles, venturing outside the realm of independent drama to blockbuster productions.

He is the eighth of nine children of Alma Elaine Conroy (née Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk & Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. His parents eventually divorced and Donnie, finding himself already in trouble, discovered a positive outlet performing in school plays and became involved in varied aspects of theater -- acting, writing, and directing. At 15, he became a member of the teen vocal group originally called NYNUK. Donnie's little brother,\nMark Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000242/?ls)\nwas originally one of the Boys but balked at the direction the group was taking and backed out.\nA founding member of the boy band \"New Kids on the Block,\" the five teens survived a false start with their debut album and proceeded to hit #1 with the single \"Please Don't Go Girl\" on their second in 1988. They continued to bombard the market with one-after-another \"Top Ten\" hits including \"The Right Stuff\" and \"I'll Be Loving You Forever.\" Leaving the young girls panting for more, they became one of the hottest young singing/line-dancing groups to hit the late 80s/early 90s. The Boys went on to sell over 70 million albums worldwide, and provoke the spawning of other five-member harmony groups such as Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. During its heyday, Donnie played up his resident \"bad boy\" persona by tallying up several run-ins with the law, including an alleged arson at a Kentucky hotel (charges were dropped). He also delved into \"body art\" with numerous tattoos and body piercings in an effort to buck their already-cloying image. Amid intergroup dissension and Milli Vanilli-like charges of not contributing all the vocals to their albums, the pop band finally disbanded in 1994 -- partly out of frustration but also having outgrown the group's juvenile moniker.\nUnsure of his direction while attracting more trouble in the tabloids, Donnie, who helped write, arrange and produce brother Mark's Funky Bunch group's first two albums a few years earlier, switched gears. He rapped some and modeled some, then transformed himself into an actor, a route taken earlier by his talented bro. While Mark has turned out to become the bigger film star over the years, Donnie has stepped out of his shadows to receive raves and renewed respect for his own tense and compelling character work.\nHe first showed up in big screen action. Making his debut as a \"tough guy\" thug in the\nMickey Rourke (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000620/?ls)\nurban outing\nBullet (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115781/?ls)\n, filmed in 1994 but not released until two years later. Usually cast as an amoral heavy, Donnie moved up the quality ladder with director\nRon Howard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/?ls)\n's thriller\nRansom (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117438/?ls)\nas part of a gang of kidnappers who nab\nMel Gibson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000154/?ls)\n's son, to their eventual regret, of course. His next repellent took the form of a drug dealer in the goth indie horror\nBlack Circle Boys (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118730/?ls)\n, but the film came and went. After a couple of TV movies, he finally nabbed a starring role in the film\nSouthie (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118766/?ls)\nplaying more or less himself as an Irish-American prodigal son who returns to the mean streets of his native Boston. The movie also featured another brother\nRobert Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906301/?ls)\nwho also was testing the acting waters.\nIronically, one of Donnie's most powerful roles during this period was also one of his briefest. Seen in the opening sequence, he is nearly unrecognizable (having dropped an alarming amount of weight) portraying a deranged former patient of psychiatrist\nBruce Willis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/?ls)\nwhose sudden explosion into unfathomable violence sets up the clever twists and turns that turned\nM. Night Shyamalan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0796117/?ls)\n's classic psychological thriller\nThe Sixth Sense (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167404/?ls)\ninto a critically-acclaimed box office hit. Donnie's opening bit was mouth dropping and jarring in its horror. He also proved he wasn't a flash in the pan by backing up this performance with a major role as a WWII paratrooper in the critically-hailed ten-part epic\nBand of Brothers (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/?ls)\n, which won multiple Emmy awards (6).\nThis TV role directly led to his casting as a gritty L.A. detective in the NBC dramatic series\nBoomtown (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319960/?ls)\n, an acclaimed series that didn't survive a second season. Since then Donnie has patented his unrefined intensity into a number of films such as\nTriggermen (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283077/?ls)\n,\nDreamcatcher (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285531/?ls)\n,\nSaw II (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432348/?ls)\n,\nAnnapolis (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417433/?ls)\n,\nSaw III (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489270/?ls)\n,\nSaw IV (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0890870/?ls)\nand\nZookeeper (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1222817/?ls)\n. He has also clocked in lead roles for such roughhewn TV series as\nRunaway (2006) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805665/?ls)\n,\nThe Kill Point (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862593/?ls)\n,\nReturn of the Mac (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6329316/?ls)\nand, most notably, as detective Danny Reagan in\nBlue Bloods (2010) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1595859/?ls)\n.\nDonny has two sons, Xavier and Elijah, by first wife Kim Fey, and is married to actress/producer/writer\nJenny McCarthy-Wahlberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000189/?ls)\n. As a former teen heartthrob seemingly headed down a troubled and dangerous path after his initial success, he somehow managed to avoid the traditional pitfalls of drugs and self-destruction, and has since proven himself an actor with \"the right stuff.\" In addition, the \"New Kids on the Block\" reteamed in 2007 in recording and book tours. The group received a Hollywood Walk of Fame star in 2014.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFormer 'New Kid On The Block', actor, brother of Mark Wahlberg\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0744834/?ref_=ls_i_125)\n125.

Roth, a psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, and clinical professor. His family is Jewish (from Austria, Hungary, Russia, and Poland). He began shooting Super 8 films at the age of eight; after watching Ridley Scott's\nAlien (1979) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/?ls)\nand vomiting, and deciding he wanted to be a producer/director. With his brothers and friends, ketchup for blood, and his father's power tools, he made over 50 short films before attending film school at NYU, where he won a student Academy Award and graduated summa cum laude in 1994.\nEli worked in film and theater production in New York City for many years, doing every job from production assistant to assistant editor to assistant to the director. At the age of 20, Roth was development head for producer Fred Zollo, a position he soon left to write full time. To earn a living, Roth did budgets and schedules for the films\nA Price Above Rubies (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120793/?ls)\nand\nIlluminata (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120709/?ls)\n, and often worked as a stand-in, where he could watch directors work with the actors. In 1995, Roth co-wrote the script that would eventually become\nCabin Fever (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303816/?ls)\nwith friend\nRandy Pearlstein (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0669132/?ls)\n, and the two spent many years unsuccessfully trying to get the film financed. Roth left New York in 1999 to live in Los Angeles, and within four months got funding for his animation series\nChowdaheads (1999) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235905/?ls)\n. Roth and friend\nNoah Belson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0069553/?ls)\n(\nCabin Fever (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303816/?ls)\n's Guitar Man) wrote and voiced the episodes, which Roth produced, directed, and designed. The episodes were due to run on WCW's #1 rated series\nWCW Monday Nitro (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185130/?ls)\nbut the CEO was fired a day before they were scheduled to air, and the episodes never ran. Roth used the episodes to set up a stop motion series called\nThe Rotten Fruit (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402052/?ls)\nwhich he produced, directed, and animated, as well as co-wrote and voiced with friend Belson. Between the two animated series, Roth worked closely with director\nDavid Lynch (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/?ls)\n, producing content for the website davidlynch.com.\nIn 2001, Roth filmed\nCabin Fever (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303816/?ls)\non a shoestring budget of $1.5 million, with private equity he and his producers raised\nfrom friends and their family. The film was the subject of a bidding war at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, eventually won by Lion's Gate,\ninstantly doubling their investors' money. It went on to not only be the highest-grossing film for Lion's Gate in 2003, but the most\nprofitable horror film released that year, garnering critical acclaim from The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Empire Magazine, and such filmmakers as\nPeter Jackson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001392/?ls)\n,\nQuentin Tarantino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/?ls)\n, and\nTobe Hooper (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001361/?ls)\n. Roth used the film's success to launch a slew of projects, including\nThe Box (2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362478/?ls)\n, a horror thriller he co-wrote with\nRichard Kelly (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0446819/?ls)\n.

Uma Thurman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000235/?ref_=ls_t_127)\nActress\nProducer\nWriter\nKill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/?ref_=ls_knf_127)\nUma Karuna Thurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a highly\nunorthodox and internationally minded family. She is the daughter of\nNena Thurman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862200/?ls)\n(née Birgitte Caroline von\nSchlebrügge), a fashion model and socialite who now runs a mountain\nretreat, and of\nRobert Thurman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862201/?ls)\n(Robert Alexander Farrar Thurman), a professor and academic who is one\nof the nation's foremost Buddhist scholars. Uma's mother was born in\nMexico City, Mexico, to a German father and a Swedish mother (who\nherself was of Swedish, Danish, and German descent). Uma's father, a\nNew Yorker, has English, Scots-Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry.\nUma grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts, where her father worked at\nAmherst College.\nShe and her siblings all have names deriving from Buddhist mythology;\nand Middle American behavior was little understood, much less pursued.\nAnd so it was that the young Thurman confronted childhood with an odd\nname and eccentric home life -- and nature seemingly conspired against\nher as well. She is six feet tall, and from an early age towered over\neveryone else in class. Her famously large feet would soon sprout to\nsize 11 -- and even beyond that -- and although they would eventually\nbe lovingly filmed by director\nQuentin Tarantino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/?ls)\n, as a child she\ngenerally wore the biggest shoes in class, which only provided another\nsubject of ridicule. Even her long nose moved one of her mother's\nfriends to helpfully suggest rhinoplasty -- to the ten-year-old\nThurman. To make matters worse yet, the family constantly relocated,\nmaking the gangly, socially inept Thurman perpetually the new kid in\nclass. The result was an exceptionally awkward, self-conscious, lonely\nand alienated childhood.\nUnsurprisingly, the young Thurman enjoyed making believe she was\nsomeone other than herself, and so thrived at acting in school plays --\nher sole successful extracurricular activity. This interest, and her\nlanky frame, perfect for modeling, led the 15-year-old Thurman to New\nYork City for high school and modeling work (including a layout in\nGlamour Magazine) as she sought acting roles. The roles soon came,\nstarting with a few formulaic and forgettable Hollywood products, but\nimmediately followed by\nTerry Gilliam (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/?ls)\n's\nThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096764/?ls)\nand\nStephen Frears (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001241/?ls)\n'\nDangerous Liaisons (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/?ls)\n,\nboth of which brought much attention to her unorthodox sensuality and\nperformances that intriguingly combined innocence and worldliness. The\nweird, gangly girl became a sex symbol virtually overnight.\nThurman continued to be offered good roles in Hollywood pictures into\nthe early\n'90s, the least commercially successful but probably best-known of which was her smoldering, astonishingly-adult performance as June,\nHenry Miller (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588469/?ls)\n's\nwife, in\nHenry & June (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099762/?ls)\n, the\nfirst movie to actually receive the dreaded NC-17 rating in the USA.\nAfter a celebrated start, Thurman's career stalled in the early '90s\nwith movies such as the mediocre\nMad Dog and Glory (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107473/?ls)\n.\nWorse, her first starring role was in\nEven Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/?ls)\n,\nwhich had endured a tortured journey from cult-favorite book to\nbig-budget movie, and was a critical and financial debacle.\nFortunately, Uma bounced back with a brilliant performance as Mia\nWallace, that most unorthodox of all gangster's molls, in Tarantino's\nlauded, hugely successful\nPulp Fiction (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/?ls)\n, a role for\nwhich Thurman received an Academy Award nomination.\nSince then, Thurman has had periods of flirting with roles in arty\nindependents such as\nA Month by the Lake (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113849/?ls)\n,\nand supporting roles in which she has lent some glamorous presence to a\nmixed batch of movies, such as\nBeautiful Girls (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115639/?ls)\nand\nThe Truth About Cats & Dogs (1996) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117979/?ls)\n.\nThurman returned to smaller films after playing the villainess Poison\nIvy in the reviled\nJoel Schumacher (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001708/?ls)\neffort\nBatman & Robin (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/?ls)\nand\nEmma Peel in a remake of\nThe Avengers (1998) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118661/?ls)\n.

Thurman also won\na Golden Globe award for her turn in the made-for-television film\nHysterical Blindness (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290664/?ls)\n,\ndirected by\nMira Nair (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619762/?ls)\n.\nA return to the mainstream spotlight came when Thurman re-teamed with\nQuentin Tarantino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/?ls)\nfor\nKill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/?ls)\n, a\nrevenge flick the two had dreamed up on the set of\nPulp Fiction (1994) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/?ls)\n. She also turned\nup in the\nJohn Woo (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000247/?ls)\ncautioner\nPaycheck (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338337/?ls)\nthat same year. The\nrenewed attention was not altogether welcome because Thurman was\ndealing with the break-up of her marriage with Hawke at about this\ntime. Thurman handled the situation with grace, however, and took her\nsurging popularity in stride. She garnered critical acclaim for her\nwork in\nKill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/?ls)\nand\nwas hailed as Tarantino's muse.

Raised with unwavering support from his parents, Dave developed a passion for the arts, leading him to the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. There, he majored in Theater Studies, performing in several plays as well as establishing a program for students called, \"The Experimental Stage,\" a creative outlet for free speech and the performing arts on campus.\nAfter college, Dave moved to Miami, and was cast in his first professional theater production as King Philip of France, in \"A Lion In Winter.\" A chance encounter with Frances Grill, founder of the CLICK modeling agency led to a meeting with fashion photographer Bruce Weber, who booked Dave for ads for Versace, Ralph Lauren, Brooks Bothers among others. Dave's focus, however, remained on acting as he used his newfound opportunity to move to New York and enroll in the acclaimed Herbert Bergdorf studio, studying under the late, celebrated actor, William Hickey, as well as an acceptance into the \"Absolute Theater Company,\" which produced off Broadway plays. After benefiting from a donation from Al Pacino, the Company was able to produce a showcase in Los Angeles, which in turn, allowed Dave to make his destined move out west.\nWith experience and a solid resume, Dave quickly booked a role in the final installment of the Crow franchise, The Crow: Wicked Prayer, for Dimension Films in 2005, opposite Danny Trejo and Dennis Hopper. Several parts in film and television followed, including recurring roles in NBC's \"Miss Match,\" alongside Alicia Silverstone and Ryan O'Neil, \"Las Vegas,\" opposite Josh Duhamel and Vanessa Marcil, and a five-episode arc on Showtime's \"Dexter,\" where Dave played Gabriel, the boyfriend to the title character's sister.\nDave can also be seen in the feature Mothers and Daughters, opposite Sharon Stone, Susan Sarandon, Selma Blair, Christina Ricci, and Courteney Cox, playing a doctor who develops a personal relationship with Selma Blair's character, as she struggles to make a tough decision regarding an unexpected pregnancy.\nOther credits include the Daytime Episodic, \"Days of Our Lives,\" CBS' \"The Mentalist,\" The CW fantasy-drama, \"The Secret Circle,\" the long-running Paramount comedy, \"All of Us,\" co-created by Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, and the popular IFC series \"Maron\" in 2015, along with countless commercials for brands such as, Bud Light, Craftsman, Honda, Toyota, Buick, Caress, Verizon and AT&T, among others.\nFor Dave, acting is a companion to his natural thirst for life and intense reflection into his own soul. He is keenly aware that an actors journey never ends, the craft never perfected, but only built layer upon layer. This intense passion has led Dave to a new endeavor as he transitions into teaching the craft as well, sharing his experience, trade-craft and unique insights of the industry that has fulfilled him for over a decade.\nNew Bedford, Massachusetts\nBest known for playing 'Gabriel' on Showtime's\nDexter\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0136797/?ref_=ls_i_136)\n136.

Her parents divorced when she was 10. She and her sister were raised by their mother. Her early interest was dance. To Bette, dancers led a glamorous life, but then she discovered the stage, and gave up dancing for acting. To her, it presented much more of a challenge.\nAfter graduation from Cushing Academy, she was refused admittance to\nEva Le Gallienne (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0499170/?ls)\n's Manhattan Civic Repertory. She enrolled in\nJohn Murray Anderson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0026960/?ls)\n's Dramatic School and was the star pupil. She was in the off-Broadway play \"The Earth Between\" (1923), and her Broadway debut in 1929 was in \"Broken Dishes\". She also appeared in \"Solid South\". Late in 1930, she was hired by Universal, where she made her first film, called\nBad Sister (1931) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021636/?ls)\n. When she arrived in Hollywood, the studio representative who went to meet her train left without her because he could find no one who looked like a movie star. An official at Universal complained she had \"as much sex appeal as\nSlim Summerville (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838843/?ls)\n\" and her performance in \"Bad Sister\" didn't impress.\nIn 1932, she signed a seven-year deal with Warner Brothers Pictures. Her first film with them was\nThe Man Who Played God (1932) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023181/?ls)\n. She became a star after this appearance, known as the actress that could play a variety of very strong and complex roles. More fairly successful movies followed, but it was the role of Mildred Rogers in RKO's\nOf Human Bondage (1934) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025586/?ls)\nthat would give Bette major acclaim from the film critics. She had a significant number of write-in votes for the Best Actress Oscar, but didn't win. Warner Bros. felt their seven-year deal with Bette was more than justified. They had a genuine star on their hands. With this success under her belt, she began pushing for stronger and more meaningful roles. In 1935, she received her first Oscar for her role in\nDangerous (1935) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026261/?ls)\nas Joyce Heath.\nIn 1936, she was suspended without pay for turning down a role that she deemed unworthy of her talent. She went to England, where she had planned to make movies, but was stopped by Warner Bros. because she was still under contract to them. They did not want her to work anywhere. Although she sued to get out of her contract, she lost. Still, they began to take her more seriously after that.\nReturning after losing her lawsuit, her roles improved dramatically. In 1938, Bette received a second Academy Award win for her work in\nJezebel (1938) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030287/?ls)\nopposite the soon-to-be-legendary\nHenry Fonda (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000020/?ls)\n. The only role she didn't get that she wanted was Scarlett O'Hara in\nGone with the Wind (1939) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031381/?ls)\n. Warners wouldn't loan her to\nDavid O. Selznick (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006388/?ls)\nunless he hired\nErrol Flynn (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001224/?ls)\nto play Rhett Butler,\nwhich both Selznick and Davis thought was a terrible choice. It was rumored she had numerous affairs, among them\nGeorge Brent (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0107575/?ls)\nand\nWilliam Wyler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943758/?ls)\n, and she was married four times, three of which ended in divorce. She admitted her career always came first.\nShe made many successful films in the 1940s, but each picture was weaker than the last and by the time her Warner Brothers contract had ended in 1949, she had been reduced to appearing in such films as the unintentionally hilarious\nBeyond the Forest (1949) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041172/?ls)\n. She made a huge comeback in 1950 when she replaced an ill\nClaudette Colbert (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001055/?ls)\nin, and\nreceived an Oscar nomination for,\nAll About Eve (1950) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042192/?ls)\n. She worked in films through the 1950s, but her career eventually came to a standstill, and in 1961 she placed a now famous Job Wanted ad in the trade papers.\nShe received an Oscar nomination for her role as a demented former child star in\nWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056687/?ls)\n. This brought about a new round of super-stardom for generations of fans who were not familiar with her work. Two years later, she starred in\nHush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058213/?ls)\n. Bette was married four times.\nIn 1977 she received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award and in 1979 she won a Best Actress Emmy for\nStrangers: The Story of a Mother and Daughter (1979) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079956/?ls)\n. In 1977-78 she moved from Connecticut to Los Angeles and filmed a pilot for the series\nHotel (1983) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085032/?ls)\n, which she called Brothel. She refused to do the TV series and suffered a stroke during this time.\nHer last marriage, to actor\nGary Merrill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0581282/?ls)\n, lasted ten years, longer than any of the previous three. In 1985, her daughter Barbara Davis (\"B.D.\") Hyman published a scandalous book about Bette called \"My Mother's Keeper.\" Bette worked in the later 1980s in films and TV, even though a stroke had impaired her appearance and mobility. She wrote a book, \"This 'N That\", during her recovery from the stroke. Her last book was \"Bette Davis, The Lonely Life\", issued in paperback in 1990. It included an update from 1962 to 1989. She wrote the last chapter in San Sebastian, Spain.\nSadly, Bette Davis died on October 6, 1989, of metastasized breast cancer, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France.

Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.\nHe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is former U.S. Representative\nMike Capuano (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4576629/?ls)\n. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister,\nCarly Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2869049/?ls)\n, and two younger siblings, a brother named\nScott Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3268924/?ls)\n, who is also an actor, and a sister named\nShana Evans (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4974640/?ls)\n. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the\nLee Strasberg (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833448/?ls)\nTheatre Institute.\nOn the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on\nThe Fugitive (2000) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247097/?ls)\n(CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring\nHarrison Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/?ls)\n.

He then appeared in his first major feature,\nNot Another Teen Movie (2001) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277371/?ls)\n, a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (\nChyler Leigh (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500200/?ls)\n) into prom queen.\nAfter filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful -\nJust Married (2003) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305711/?ls)\nand\nEastwick (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362585/?ls)\n- he appeared in another listless teen comedy,\nThe Perfect Score (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314498/?ls)\n, playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\n, a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and\nKim Basinger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000107/?ls)\nas the damsel in distress,\nCellular (2004) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337921/?ls)\nfailed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in\nFantastic Four (2005) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120667/?ls)\n, 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.\nThe year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance.\nThe Nanny Diaries (2007) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489237/?ls)\n, where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive.

Movie (and TV) fans then discovered what East coast theater-going audiences had uncovered decades before -- Olympia Dukakis was an acting treasure. Her adaptability to various ethnicities (Greek, Italian, Jewish, Eastern European, etc.), as well her chameleon-like versatility in everything from cutting edge comedy to stark tragedy, kept her in high demand for 30 years as one of Hollywood's topnotch character players.\nOlympia Dukakis was born on June 20, 1931, in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Greek immigrants, Alexandra (Christos), from the Peloponnese, and Constantine S. Dukakis, from Anatolia. She majored in physical therapy at Boston University, where she graduated with a BA. Olympia practiced as a physical therapist during the polio epidemic. She later returned to her alma mater and entered the graduate program in performing arts, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree.\nOlympia found early success by distinguishing herself first on stage performing in summer stock and with several repertory and Shakespearean companies throughout the county. She made her Broadway debut as an understudy in \"The Aspern Papers\" at age 30, followed by very short runs in the plays \"Abraham Cochrane\" (1964) and \"Who's Who in Hell\" (1974). In 1999, she premiered a one-woman play \"Rose,\" at the National Theatre in London and subsequently on Broadway in 2000. The play earned her an Outer Critics Circle Award and Drama Desk Award nomination and she continues to tour the country with it.\nOlympia was seen on the New York stage in the Roundabout Theatre's production of \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\" (2011), in San Francisco in A.C.T.'s production of \"Vigil\" (2011) and as \"Prospera\" in \"The Tempest\" (2012) at Shakespeare & Co. She has performed in over 130 productions Off-Broadway and regionally at theaters including the Public Theatre, A.C.T., Shakespeare in the Park, Shakespeare & Co., and the Williamstown Summer Theatre Festival, where she also served as Associate Director. She was seen again at Shakespeare & Co. in the summer of 2013 as the title role in \"Mother Courage and Her Children.\"\nOlympia married Yugoslav-American actor\nLouis Zorich (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0957922/?ls)\nin 1962. The New York-based couple went on to co-found The Whole Theatre Company in Montclair, New Jersey, and ran the company for 19 years (1971-1990). As actress, director, producer and teacher, she still found the time to raise their three young children. She also became a master instructor at New York University for fourteen years. She scored theater triumphs in \"A Man's a Man,\" for which she won an Off-Broadway Obie Award in 1962; several productions of \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Mother Courage\"; \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\"; \"The Rose Tattoo\"; \"The Seagull\"; \"The Marriage of Bette and Boo\" (another Obie Award); and, more notably, her many performances as the title role in \"Hecuba.\" A good portion of her successes was launched within the walls of her own theater company, which encouraged the birth of new and untried plays.\nOlympia's prolific stage directing credits include many of the classics: \"Orpheus Descending,\" \"The House of Bernarda Alba,\" \"Uncle Vanya,\" and \"A Touch of the Poet,\" as well as the more contemporary (\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"Kennedy's Children\"). She also adapted such plays as \"Mother Courage\" and \"The Trojan Women\" for the theater company. Over the duration of their marriage, she and her husband have experienced shared successes, appearing together in \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" \"Camino Real, \"The Three Sisters\" and \"The Seagull,\" among many others. Both are master interpreters of Chekhovian plays -- one of their more recent acting collaborations was in \"The Chekhov Cycle\" in 2003.\nMaking an inauspicious debut in a bit role as a mental patient in\nLilith (1964) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058294/?ls)\n, she tended to gravitate toward off-the-wall films with various offshoots of the ethnic mother.

He is an actor, comedian , host, producer and\nwriter. In July 1993, he legally changed his name to ANT from Anthony\nSteven Kalloniatis. The correct orthography is ANT, spelled in all\ncaps.\nBorn to Greek immigrant parents (Lee and Maria - whom he talks about\nfrequently in his stand-up routines), Ant was raised strict Greek\nOrthodox. As he entered adulthood he ventured away from strict\nOrthodoxy and studied many other religions including Taoism, Hinduism\nand even Scientology. ANT believes that he is just a spiritual being\nlooking for answers.\nANT attended Londonderry High School and the University of New\nHampshire where he was affectionately known as \"what's your name\nagain?\" Inebriated at a bar one night, he got up on stage at a local\ntalent contest and performed a crude stand-up routine for the first\ntime. He lost. But a seed was planted and he knew comedy was his\ncalling. College didn't seem to suit his growing fascination with\nstand-up comedy, and in 1986 he dropped out of college after only\nattending a single semester.\nIn 1993 he moved to Los Angeles and began performing comedy full time.\nIt didn't take long for the networks to take notice of him and in 1994,\nstarred in the Fox Television pilot, \"Howe High.\" From there he went on\nto a co-starring role as Barry Wallenstein on the WB series, \"Unhappily\nEver After,\" (Created by Ron Leavitt of Married with Children).\nThroughout his career, ANT has appeared on many series and specials\nincluding the remake of To Tell The Truth where he replaced Paula\nPoundstone as a regular celebrity panelist. Other shows include;\nTosh.0, America's Next Top Model, The Insider, Kathy Griffin: My life\non the D list, The Jamie Foxx Show, For your love, Son of a beach, Gene\nSimmons: Family Jewels, Sweet Valley High, Queer as Folk, Weekends at\nthe DL, Nightstand, The Dennis Miller Show, But Can They Sing, Steve\nHarvey's Big Time, The Tyra Banks show, Comics Unleashed and many\nothers.\nHis big opportunity came with NBC's Last Comic Standing. A weekly\nreality show featuring stand-up comedians competing to be crowned the\nfunniest comic in America. Over 10,000 comedians tried out. ANT\nadvanced all the way to the semi-finals in Las Vegas but did not make\nit into the house. The second season, he made it into the house and was\n6th runner up out of hundreds of thousands of comedians. Then NBC\nordered a third season of LCS, and the format was changed slightly.\nSeason one would do battle against season two in LCS: The Battle of the\nBest. With ANT's hilarious help season (2) easily bested season one and\nwent on to win every head to head challenge and ultimately the\ncompetition.\nHe used that forward momentum parlaying it into a hosting job on the\nVH1 series, Celebrity Fit Club. He has been the host of the hit series\nfor 6 of its 7 unprecedented seasons (no other VH1 series has gone on\nto 7 seasons). That year he also released his hit live performance DVD\nentitled, \"ANT: America's Ready\".\nIn 1997, ANT moved out of his comfort zone, becoming a celebrity\nparticipant on the VH1 series, CelebraCadabra (magic with the stars).\nThere he revealed a deep rooted fear of clowns. He was eliminated 2nd\nwhen dressed as a grocery store candy aisle; he was mauled by a\nrambunctious group of 2nd graders all vying for something sweet. After\nhis departure from the series, the ratings tumbled and VH1 brought ANT\nback in subsequent episodes to appease angry fans.\nOver his career, ANT has appeared on numerous occasions on the Tonight\nShow with Jay Leno (9 times), The Howard Stern Radio show, and garnered\nhis own series on MTV Network's Logo Channel which bears his name: The\nU.S of ANT.\nIn features, he can be seen in Twin Falls, Idaho, I am Comic, Circuit,\nAngels Baby!, Another Gay Movie, National Lampoon's Totally Baked, The\nUnderground Comedy Movie (with Michael Clarke Duncan), and Sister Mary.\nHe has 3 siblings, Andrea, Althea and Frank. In January of 2007 he\nsigned on to be a Spokesman for the diet company Nutrisystem after\nlosing 43 pounds on their program.

Maura Tierney (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005491/?ref_=ls_t_186)\nActress\nProducer\nSoundtrack\nER (1999–2009) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108757/?ref_=ls_knf_186)\nOn the viewing horizon since the late 1980s, actress Maura Tierney has been a steady product of independent features, some hits and some misses, for close to a decade and a half. An odd and compelling beauty, she came from an upscale Bostonian family and was raised in the Hyde Park district.\nBorn February 3, 1965, the eldest child of three of Pat, a real estate agent, and Joseph M. Tierney, a prosperous politician and city councilman, Maura Lynn Tierney initially studied at New York University. She left school prior to graduation when she hooked up with the Circle-in-the-Square theater school. Following some stage plays including \"Baby with the Bathwater\" and \"Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,\" she moved to the West Coast in the late 1980s finding minor roles here and there in TV-movies and making the rounds on episodic shows such as\nGrowing Pains (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088527/?ls)\n,\nFamily Ties (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083413/?ls)\nand\nLaw & Order (1990) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098844/?ls)\n. She met actor/husband\nBilly Morrissette (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607365/?ls)\nafter both were fired from the set of an eventually-scrapped\nRalph Macchio (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001494/?ls)\nseries.\nAfter a few other failed pilots and a short-lived TV series, Maura made a minor film debut with\nThe Linguini Incident (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102313/?ls)\nand progressed to leading lady status in the B-movie spoof\nDead Women in Lingerie (1991) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101676/?ls)\n, which didn't go over well. She finally hit paydirt on TV when she won a female co-lead as smart but insecure newswriter Lisa Miller on the comedy series\nNewsRadio (1995) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112095/?ls)\n. The show sailed along for a number of seasons due to the fine comedy instincts of\nDave Foley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004929/?ls)\n,\nAndy Dick (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004873/?ls)\nand the late\nSaturday Night Live (1975) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072562/?ls)\nplayer\nPhil Hartman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0367005/?ls)\n.

The show couldn't escape its bad aura, and it was gone the following year.\nMaura's work on the TV sitcom thrust her into the film comedy limelight with prominent roles in such films as the\nJim Carrey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000120/?ls)\nvehicle\nLiar Liar (1997) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119528/?ls)\n.

Appointed by the Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army, Washington led the Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War and served as the president of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which created the Constitution of the United States and the American federal government. Washington has been called the \"Father of the Nation\" for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the country.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1547016/?ref_=ls_i_2)\n2.

He was previously the second vice president of the United States under John Adams and the first United States secretary of state under George Washington. The principal author of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was a proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, motivating American colonists to break from the Kingdom of Great Britain and form a new nation. He produced formative documents and decisions at state, national, and international levels.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7136057/?ref_=ls_i_4)\n4. James Madison (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7136057/?ref_=ls_t_4)\nWriter\n1787 the American Constitution (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12148002/?ref_=ls_knf_4)\nHe enjoyed a humanistic school education. Madison completed his studies in 1771 with a Bachelor of Arts. He showed particular interest in the new ideas of the time, the Enlightenment, with which he dealt intensively. He became politically active at an early age. In 1776 he was elected to the Virginia Convention, which advocated independence and a constitution. During the American Revolution he campaigned for the colonial resistance movement against Great Britain in Virginia. Here he met the governor and later President Thomas Jefferson, with whom he became lifelong friends. In 1780, James Madison was elected to the Continental Congress, where he advocated for a strong central government that would help complete American liberation. The planter was instrumental in the preparations for the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention, where he drafted the so-called \"Virginia Plan\" in May 1787.\nIn it, Madison advocated for a strong national central government that would guarantee personal freedoms, party diversity, and federal freedoms. With this model of a balanced party system that should lead to a mutual sharing of power, Madison founded the basic principle of the republican system of government in the USA. From 1789 to 1797, Madison represented Virginia in Congress. In 1794 he married Dolley Payne Todd. After supporting the presidential campaign of his friend Thomas Jefferson, Madison was appointed Secretary of State when he took office in 1801. In the election campaign of 1808, Madison himself was elected fourth president of the United States. Although he became embroiled in war with Great Britain on June 18, 1812, Madison was re-elected to a second term that same year.\nThe war with Great Britain was initially very disadvantageous for the USA. In 1814, Madison watched as the Capitol and White House were set ablaze by British troops. Nevertheless, the President was able to end the war with an advantageous peace agreement within the end of the year. A hugely popular leader, Madison left the office of president in March 1817. In the coming years he assisted Jefferson in planning the University of Virginia. He acted as an advisor to the next President James Monroe. In 1829, Madison officially returned to political life to attend the Virginia Constitutional Convention. He then withdrew into private life as a quiet observer of politics.\nJames Madison died on June 28, 1836 in Montpelier, Virginia.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1129526/?ref_=ls_i_5)\n5. James Monroe (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1129526/?ref_=ls_t_5)\nWriter\nJames Monroe was born on 28 April 1758 in Westmoreland County, Virginia, USA. He was a writer. He was married to Elizabeth Kortright. He died on 4 July 1831 in New York City, New York, USA.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9633522/?ref_=ls_i_6)\n6. John Quincy Adams (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9633522/?ref_=ls_t_6)\nHis father, John Adams, served as the second president of the United States from 1797 to 1801. In 1779, at the age of 12, the young Adams accompanied his father to Europe. There the linguistically gifted boy supported the US embassy as a translator and secretary. When Adams enrolled at Harvard in 1785, he already had knowledge of Greek, Latin, French, Dutch and German. After studying law, he began working as a lawyer in Boston in 1790. At the same time, he gained a certain level of notoriety by writing political essays for the press in support of George Washington's administration. In 1793 the young Adams was sent to the Netherlands as a diplomat. On a diplomatic mission to London he met the American consulate's daughter Louisa Catherine Johnson, whom he married in 1797. In the same year Adams was sent as an envoy to Prussia.\nReturning to the United States, he was elected to the Massachusetts Senate in 1801. In 1803 he was appointed to the US Senate, where he served until 1808. In 1809, Adams went on a diplomatic mission to Russia, where he was able to win over Tsar Alexander as a mediator in the American conflict with Great Britain. In 1812 he helped negotiate the peace treaty with Great Britain. From 1815 Adams worked as an ambassador in London. Two years later, he was appointed Secretary of State by President James Monroe. In complete agreement with the president, in this role until 1825 he contributed to raising the USA to an equal size with the European powers, giving them independent diplomacy and helping them make territorial gains. In this context, Adams was instrumental in the negotiations that led to the acquisition of Florida and the securing of Louisiana's western border. In 1823 he contributed to the development of the \"Monroe Doctrine\".\nIn 1824, Adams won the American presidential election to become the sixth president of the United States for one term from the following year. However, his policy of internal reform and national consolidation was largely unsuccessful due to opposition resistance. In the election campaign of 1828, John Quincy Adams was overwhelmingly defeated by Andrew Jackson, who succeeded him as president a year later. After a temporary withdrawal from political life, Adams was elected to the House of Representatives in 1831, where he served until his death in 1848. As an independent, he took up the demand for the abolition of slavery without joining the ranks of the abolitionists. Soon after, he suffered a stroke in the House of Representatives.\nJohn Quincy Adams died on February 23, 1848 in Washington.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1757329/?ref_=ls_i_7)\n7.

Before being elected to the presidency, Jackson gained fame as a general in the United States Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. An expansionist president, Jackson sought to advance the rights of the \"common man\" against a \"corrupt aristocracy\" and to preserve the Union.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9616897/?ref_=ls_i_8)\n8.

William Henry Harrison (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8813136/?ref_=ls_t_9)\nHarrison, who was born on a plantation, also came from a distinguished family of planters and politicians. His father, Benjamin Harrison, was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. He was governor of Virginia between 1781 and 1784. William Harrison initially studied at college and at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1792 he joined the army. In 1794 he was used against the Indians in Ohio. A year later, Harrison married Anna Tuthill Symmes, an Ohio girl. In 1798, Harrison left the army as a captain. Harrison was then elected as a representative in the US Congress. In 1801, President John Adams made him governor of Indiana. During his 12 years in office, Harrison proved himself in the fight against the Indians, who had come together to form a federation under the leadership of Tecumseh.\nDuring the war with Great Britain from 1812 to 1814, he secured American rule over Indiana and the Northwest. Returning to Ohio, William Harrison was elected to the House of Representatives in 1816, where he was represented until 1819. In 1825 he was elected to the US Senate, where William Harrison was active until 1828. In 1828, President John Quincy Adams sent Harrison as an envoy to Colombia, but he was recalled the following year. After a temporary withdrawal from politics, Harrison was considered a candidate in the presidential election in 1836, which was won by Martin van Buren. In the following election campaign in 1840, Harrison was able to garner the majority of votes. In March 1841 he took office as the ninth President of the USA.\nWilliam Henry Harrison died of pneumonia in Washington just one month later, on April 4, 1841. He was succeeded by John Tyler.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8271830/?ref_=ls_i_10)\n10. John Tyler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8271830/?ref_=ls_t_10)\nHis father was governor of Virginia and a judge. After graduating from college in 1807, Tyler studied law. At 19 he was admitted to the bar. From 1811 to 1815, Tyler sat in the Virginia House of Delegates. He then served as a Democratic member of the US House of Representatives from 1817 to 1821. Tyler was appointed governor of Virginia in 1825. In 1827 he resigned from this position because he was now elected to the US Senate, where he was represented until 1836. In these positions, Tyler distinguished himself as a staunch advocate of the \"states' rights\" theory and a faithful interpretation of the Constitution. The doctrine advocated the primary sovereignty and independence of the US states over the federal government. After turning away from the Democratic Party, Tyler was elected vice president in 1840 as the Whig candidate.\nHowever, the new President William Harrison died in 1841 after only a month in office. Therefore, Tyler succeeded him as the tenth President of the USA on April 4, 1841. Differences with his new Whig party blocked the new president's key domestic policy initiatives. As a southern aristocrat, the former Virginia governor and senator was only put forward to win southern voters for Harrison. However, his political views were opposed to those of the Whig Party, which represented the interests of the northeastern states with their emerging industry and business community - so he vetoed the establishment of a national bank, which was a fundamental concern of the Whigs and their most prominent senator, Henry Clay. In the fall of 1841, he was expelled from the Whig Party. In 1842, when he vetoed the tariff bill, Congress tried, but failed, to impeach him.\nIn the area of foreign policy, Tyler prepared the incorporation of Texas into the Union after his presidency. In 1842, his Secretary of State Daniel Webster was able to reach a border treaty with Great Britain that established the border between Maine and Canada. In the run-up to the Civil War, he campaigned for secession and was elected to the Congress of the Confederacy, but died of a stroke before he could take office. In the presidential election of 1844, Tyler was no longer a candidate. Tyler was replaced in 1845 by James Knox Polk. After his presidency, however, Tyler remained involved in political life. Shortly before his death, he was elected to the Congress of the Confederate States of America in 1861. The politician died before its meetings opened.\nJohn Tyler died on January 18, 1862 in Richmond, Virginia.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8813142/?ref_=ls_i_11)\n11. Zachary Taylor (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8813142/?ref_=ls_t_11)\nZachary Taylor was an American military leader who served as the 12th president of the United States from 1849 until his death in 1850. Taylor previously was a career officer in the United States Army, rising to the rank of major general and becoming a national hero as a result of his victories in the Mexican-American War. As a result, he won election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs. His top priority as president was preserving the Union. He died sixteen months into his term, having made no progress on the most divisive issue in Congress, slavery.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9078718/?ref_=ls_i_12)\n12. James Buchanan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9078718/?ref_=ls_t_12)\nAfter graduating from college in 1809, Buchanan became a lawyer. In 1814 he entered the Pennsylvania Assembly as a Federalist representative. In 1820 Buchanan was elected to the US House of Representatives, where he served until 1831. At the same time he served as envoy to Russia from 1823 to 1833. He became a leading figure in the newly emerging Democratic Party in Pennsylvania. From 1834 to 1845 he served in the US Senate, where he supported the southern states' position on the slave issue. Under the presidency of James Knox Polk (1845-1849), Buchanan played a key role in his expansionist policies as Secretary of State.\nMeanwhile, he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations from 1836 to 1841. He reached an agreement with Great Britain on the Oregon issue. In the war against Mexico (1846-1848) he advocated the annexation of large parts of the neighboring country. President Franklin Pierce sent Buchanan as an envoy to Great Britain from 1853 to 1856. In 1856 he won the US presidential election as the Democratic candidate. The following year he began his term in the White House. Buchanan was the only unmarried President of the United States. His niece, Harriet Lane, served as \"First Lady\" during his term.\nAs with his predecessor Franklin Pierce, Buchanan's efforts at reconciliation and compromise were doomed to failure in view of the increasingly irreconcilable conflict over the slave issue. During his presidency, the Democratic Party was increasingly divided into northern and southern factions. An economic depression and conflict with the Mormons in Utah continued to complicate the domestic political environment of Buchanan's administration. Having already lost the 1860 presidential election to Abraham Lincoln, Buchanan faced his final crisis in office with the secession of South Carolina.\nThe US President lacked the ability to take decisive action to counteract the southern state's secession from the Union. Amid allegations of having been responsible for the dissolution of the Union and the outbreak of the American Civil War, Buchanan bitterly withdrew from the presidency and politics in 1861.\nJames Buchanan died on June 1, 1868 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1118823/?ref_=ls_i_13)\n13. Abraham Lincoln (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1118823/?ref_=ls_t_13)\nWriter\nSoundtrack\nLincoln's Gettysburg Address (1912) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002309/?ref_=ls_knf_13)\nAbraham Lincoln was an American politician from Kentucky. He was the second presidential candidate of the then-new Republican Party, following John Charles Frémont (1813 - 1890). He served as President of the United States from 1861 to 1865, during the American Civil War. He was assassinated in April 1865, the first of four American presidents to be assassinated during their term in office.\nIn February 1809, Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin, located on the Sinking Spring Farm . The Farm itself was located near the modern city of Hodgenville, Kentucky, which was incorporated in 1836. Lincoln was the second child born to the illiterate farmer Thomas Lincoln (1778-1851) and his first wife Nancy Hanks (1784-1818). Both of his parents were born in Virginia.\nLincoln was a namesake grandson of Captain Abraham Lincoln (1744 - 1786), a military veteran of the American Revolutionary War. The senior Abraham was born in Pennsylvania, and settled in the areas of modern Kentucky in 1781. He was shot by an unnamed Native American in May 1786, while working in his field. The Lincoln family were descendants of Samuel Lincoln (1622 - 1690), an English weaver who had settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1637.\nLincoln's father Thomas bought or leased various farms in Kentucky, but lost most of his land in court disputes over property titles. In 1816, the Lincoln family settled in Indiana, which at the time had a more reliable and surveying system. Indiana was a \"free-state\", having abolished slave-holding in 1816. This suited Thomas' religious beliefs. He had joined the Separate Baptists, a religious group which forbade its members to own slaves.\nIn October 1818, Lincoln's mother Nancy died due to milk sickness. She had ingested milk cow containing the poison tremetol. She was 34-years-old at the time of her death. Lincoln was only 9-years-old at the time. The boy's primary caregiver for a while was his older sister Sarah Lincoln (1807 - 1828), who took over most household duties.\nIn December 1819, Lincoln's father married his second wife Sarah Bush (1788 - 1869). She was a widow, with three children of her own from a previous marriage. Lincoln grew close to his stepmother, and started calling her mother. By that time, Lincoln was old enough to start working in the farm. He reportedly never liked the physical labor, and his family regarded him as particularly lazy.\nLincoln received little formal schooling, relying on brief tutoring by itinerant teachers. He learned to read at the age of 7, but was not trained to write for several years. However, he became a bibliophile and spend most of his free time \"reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc\" He was largely self-educated, reading on a variety of topics.\nAs a teenager, Lincoln was \"tall, strong, and athletic\". He was trained in the \"catch-as-catch-can\" style of wrestling, a grappling style, and had a career as an amateur wrestler. He earned his reputation in the sport by defeating the leader of \"the Clary's Grove Boys\", a local gang of troublemakers.\nIn 1830, the Lincoln family moved to Macon County, Illinois. By that time, Lincoln was 21-years-old, legally entering adulthood. His relationship with his father Thomas became difficult, as young Lincoln craved for financial independence. In 1831, Thomas and most of his family settled in a new homestead, located in Coles County, Illinois. Lincoln decided not to follow them, and started living on his own. He settled for a few years in New Salem, Illinois.\nIn 1831, Lincoln and his partner Denton Offutt purchased a general store in New Salem. Lincoln gained a reputation of honesty, when he realized that he had accidentally overcharged a customer and voluntarily returned the money to him. By 1832, the general store had failed. The partnership was dissolved.\nAlso In 1832, Lincoln stood as a candidate for the Illinois General Assembly. He was an unlikely candidate, as he was rather poor and lacked political connections. He received 277 votes, nearly every vote in the village of New Salem. He lost the election as he was unknown outside this village.\nIn the early 1830s, Lincoln worked as New Salem's postmaster, and then as county surveyor. He aspired to become a lawyer, and read law on his own. He extensively studied legal texts in order to qualify. He later claimed that he was entirely self-taught. In 1834, Lincoln sought election to the Illinois General Assembly again. This time, he stood as a candidate for the powerful Whig Party and won the election. He served four terms in the General Assembly.\nLincoln's first known romantic relationship involved Ann Rutledge (1813 - 1835), a local woman who was reputedly engaged to another man. Rutledge died in August 1835, during a typhoid epidemic. She was only 22-years-old at the time of her death. Lincoln became severely depressed following her death. Biographers think that he wrote the poem \"The Suicide's Soliloquy\"(1838), to record his own suicidal thoughts during this period.\nIn 1836, Lincoln was admitted to the Illinois bar, and moved to Springfield Illinois to practice law. He started his career as a lawyer by practicing law under experienced lawyer John Todd Stuart (1807 - 1885), who happened to be a long-time friend of Lincoln. Lincoln gained a reputation as a formidable trial lawyer in cases involving cross-examinations.\nIn his political career in the 1830s, Lincoln championed the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which connected the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. He later served as a Canal Commissioner. He voted to expand suffrage to all white males, not only white landowners. He adopted a \"free soil\" policy, vocally opposing both slavery and abolitionism. He favored the plan of the Whig party leader Henry Clay (1777 - 1852) to use freedmen in the colonization of Liberia.\nIn 1839, Lincoln became romantically interested in Mary Todd (1818 - 1882), a daughter of the wealthy businessman Robert Smith Todd (1791-1849). They were engaged in 1840, and were married in 1842. They had four sons. Mary had a higher social standing than Lincoln, being part of the gentry in Springfield, Illinois. She had reputedly rejected several suitors. Her most notable suitor before Lincoln was the successful lawyer Stephen Arnold Douglas (1813 -1861).\nIn 1842, Lincoln's last term in the Illinois General Assembly ended. In 1843, he sought the Whig nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lost the nomination to John Jay Hardin (1810 - 1847), but convinced party officials to not renominate Hardin in the next election. Lincoln won the Whig nomination in 1846, and went on to win the election. He served as a congressman from 1847 to 1849. During this time, Lincoln was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation.\nDuring his term in congress, Lincoln proposed a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and to compensate slave owners for the loss of property. The bill failed to gain sufficient support, even from his own party. Lincoln spoke out against the country's involvement in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), warning that the price of glory would be \"showers of blood\".\nLincoln did not seek renomination to Congress in the 1848 election, honoring a 1846 pledge to serve a single term. He supported Zachary Taylor's campaign to win the Whig nomination for the presidency. When Taylor won the presidential election, Lincoln expected political favors from the new president. Taylor offered to Lincoln an appointment as secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory, which was at that time a stronghold of the Democratic Party. Lincoln declined the offer, as it would require him to abandon his legal career in Illinois. He resumed life as a lawyer.\nDuring the 1850s, Lincoln was one of Illinois' leading lawyers. He appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, and was the sole counsel in 51 of these cases. He solidified his reputation as a defense lawyer in two murder trials. In the trial of Duff Armstrong (1833-1899), Lincoln was able to prove that a key eyewitness was actually lying about what he had seen. Lincoln found that the witness stood at too great a distance in nighttime conditions to have seen anything. In the trial of Simeon Quinn \"Peachy\" Harrison (a cousin of Lincoln), Lincoln was able to convince a judge that the dying declaration of the murder victim should not be excluded as hearsay, That declaration was that the victim had actively provoked Harrison into attacking, helping the defense's case.\nIn 1854, Lincoln resumed his active participation in political life by speaking out against the controversial Kansas-Nebraska Act, a law that repealing the Missouri Compromise (1820), and would allow for the expansion of slavery to the new territories of Kansas and Nebraska. The Whig Party split in two due to its factions' different reactions to the new law. The Party's anti-slavery faction helped establish the new Republican Party, which also attracted anti-slavery politicians from the Free Soil Party, the Liberty Party, and the Democratic Party.\nIn 1854, Lincoln stood as a Whig candidate to the United States Senate. He was not able to secure the election, but managed to convince his supporters to vote for Lyman Trumbull (1813 - 1896), an anti-slavery Democrat with similar views to their own. Trumbull won the election. In 1856, Lincoln formally joined the Republican Party. At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, Lincoln was one of the candidates for the party's nomination for Vice President of the United States. Lincoln received 110 votes, finishing second among the candidates. The vice-presidential nomination was instead won by William Lewis Dayton (1807 - 1864).\nIn 1858, Lincoln stood as a Republican candidate for the United States Senate. His opponent was Stephen Arnold Douglas, a leading Democrat politician. The Senate campaign featured seven debates between Lincoln and Douglas, which attracted nationwide attention. The candidates argued extensively over the legal and moral status of slavery in the United States. In this elections, the Republican Party won the popular vote, but the Democratic Party won more seats. The legislature re-appointed Douglas to the Senate. But Lincoln had become nationally famous, and he was often mentioned by the press as a likely presidential candidate.\nIn 1860, Lincoln received early endorsements as a presidential candidate. In the 1860 Republican National Convention, he secured the party's nomination. His most significant rival for the nomination was William Henry Seward (1801-1872), who finished second among the various candidates. Only Lincoln and Seward received over 50 votes from delegates. The party's nomination for vice president was secured by Hannibal Hamlin (1809 - 1891), a former Democrat who had opposed slavery for most of his career.\nIn the 1860 United States presidential election, the Democratic Party was split into two rival factions, which nominated different candidates. In the election, Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the popular vote. In the electoral college, he received 180 votes, winning the election. Lincoln every one of the free Northern states, plus California and Oregon in the recently annexed Western United States. He received no votes at all in 10 of the 15 slave states.\nLincoln started his presidency in March 1861. By that time, 7 states had already seceded from the Union in reaction to his victory (in chronological order: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas). The American Civil War started in April 1861 with the Battle of Fort Sumter, a bombardment of a Union fort located near Charleston, South Carolina. On April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send a total of 75,000 volunteer troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and \"preserve the Union\". In Baltimore rioting crowds started attacking Union forces. Lincoln suspended the right of habeas corpus in select areas, allowing the government forces to confine people without formal trials. Thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers were confined.\nLincoln soon established his executive control over the Union's war effort, and helped shape its military strategy, He expanded his war powers, and exercising \"unprecedented authority\" over the country. He had the full support of the Republican-controlled Congress, as well as popular support in states loyal to the Union. His political opposition consisted of two different factions, the Copperheads and the Radical Republicans. The Copperheads were a faction of the Democratic Party which demanded a compromise on the matter of slavery, and a peace settlement with the Confederates. The Radical Republicans were a faction of the Republican Party which demanded the \"permanent eradication of slavery\", and rejected any ideas concerning compromises with slave-owners.\nIn September 1862, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the emancipation of slaves in 10 Confederate states. The Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln had started recruiting \"black troops\" in massive numbers. By the end of the year, 20 regiments of African Americans from the Mississippi Valley had been recruited by the Union.\nLincoln ran for re-election in the 1864 United States presidential election. He united the main factions of the Republican Party and the War Democrats (a pro-Union faction of the Democratic Party) into a coalition known as Union Party. The remaining factions of the Democratic Party made the mistake of nominating retired general George Brinton McClellan (1826 - 1885) as their presidential candidate. McClellan held a grudge against Lincoln, but rejected any ideas concerning peace with the Confederates. Meaning that the Copperheads could see little difference between him and Lincoln.\nLincoln won the presidential election with 2,218,388 votes, representing 55.0% of the popular vote. 78% of Union soldiers. voted fort him, as they did not want a compromise to end the War. Lincoln won 212 electoral votes, and had the support of 22 out of the Union's 25 states. His new vice-president was Andrew Johnson (1808 - 1875), a prominent War Democrat.\nIn 1865, the Union seemed to be winning the American Civil War. On April 14, 1865, Lincoln and his wife attended Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. They wanted to see a performance of the then-popular British play \"Our American Cousin\" (1858) by Tom Taylor (1817 - 1880). During the performance, Lincoln was assassinated by the well-known actor John Wilkes Booth (1838 - 1865). Booth was a Confederate sympathizer, and hoped to turn the tide of the War. Lincoln was 56-years-old at the time of his death.\nLincoln's corpse was returned for burial to Springfield, Illinois, where he had lived for decades. On May 4, 1865, Lincoln was interred at the Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. The Lincoln Tomb later became a state historic site. His wife and three of their four sons were later buried there as well.\nHistorians tend to rank Lincoln among the top Presidents of the United States. Due to his violent death, he came to be regarded as \"a national martyr\". Several political factions trace their origins to Lincoln's ideas and policies. He has been described as \"a classical liberal\" of the 19th-century, and is well-regarded for his policies favoring trade and business.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4667103/?ref_=ls_i_14)\n14. Andrew Johnson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4667103/?ref_=ls_t_14)\nWithout sufficient schooling, he trained as a tailor. Johnson then moved to Greeneville, Tennessee, where he opened a tailor shop in 1826. A year later he married Eliza McCardle, who helped him learn to read and write. Johnson's business began to prosper and gained him great public profile in the local community. There he became increasingly politically active. Johnson served in Congress from 1843 to 1853. He then served as Governor of Tennessee until 1857.\nIn the same year he was finally elected to the US Senate. At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Johnson was the only southern senator to support the continued existence of the Union. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee. There he supported the state's reincorporation into the Union and convened a constitutional convention that abolished slavery in Tennessee in January 1865. In 1864, Johnson was elevated to vice president of the United States. After Lincoln died on April 15, 1865 as a result of an assassination attempt, Johnson assumed the presidency. The new president carried the heavy legacy of restoring the American Union after the Civil War.\nHe initiated the adoption of new constitutions for the southern states and implemented amnesties. However, since the southern states undermined anti-slavery regulations in many areas, Johnson increasingly came into conflict with Congress with his Reconstruction policy. The conflict reached its climax when the President vetoed a congressional legislative initiative in 1866 that aimed to increase rights for freed slaves. On February 25, 1868, Congress initiated impeachment proceedings against the US President. The primary motive for the impeachment proceedings was Johnson's violation of formal rules.\nHowever, the real reason for the unusual measure - Johnson was the first and only US president to be affected by it - was the obvious resistance with which the president met the will of Congress. The impeachment failed by one vote in the Senate. Johnson was able to continue in office until he handed it over to his successor Ulysses Grant in 1869. In 1875, Johnson was re-elected to the U.S. Senate as a representative from Tennessee. However, a stroke prevented him from performing this function.\nAndrew Johnson died shortly thereafter on July 31, 1875 in Carter Station, Tennessee.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5061578/?ref_=ls_i_15)\n15.

Born on October 4, 1822, in Delaware, Ohio,the former\nCivil War general served a single term in the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives from 1865 and 1867 and then served as Governor of Ohio\nfrom 1868 to 1872 and from 1876 to 1877, when he surrendered that\noffice for the presidency. He won the Republican nomination in 1876\nbecause reform-minded Republicans blocked the bid of former President\nUlysses S. Grant, whose two terms in office had been marked by\nunprecedented political corruption, for a non-consecutive third term.\nHe won the nickname \"Rutherfraud\" for winning election as the 19th\nPresident of the United States by being virtually appointed by an\nelectoral commission adjudicating the disputed 1876 election. (The\ncommission made a deal granting the Republicans the presidency in\nreturn for the Democrats' request to end Reconstruction in the former\nConfederate States. The deal damned black freedmen to quasi-slavery for\nnearly 100 more years.) It was an electoral anomaly that wouldn't be\nrepeated until 2000, when the right-wing Rhenquist Court virtually\nanointed GOP contender\nGeorge W.

He was admitted to the bar in\n1864 and began a law practice in Indianapolis, Indiana, but soon became\ninvolved in Republican politics. He held some minor party and appointed\noffices, During the Civil War he organized an army unit, the 70th\nIndiana Infantry, which he commanded as a colonel. The unit was posted\nto mostly garrison duty in Kentucky and Tennessee, and in 1864 it was\nattached to the forces of Gen. William T.

He ran in the Republican primary for the\ngubernatorial nomination in 1872, but was unsuccessful. In 1876 he\nfinally got the nomination, but lost the election. In 1880 he headed\nthe Indiana delegation to the Republican convention and was a major\nfactor in securing the presidential nomination for James A. Garfield,\nwho won the election.

He ran against Democrat\nGrover Cleveland (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166479/?ls)\n, and although\nCleveland won the popular vote, Harrison received more votes in the\nelectoral college, therefore winning the presidency.\nAs President, Harrison's most notable accomplishments occurred in\nforeign affairs, and he sponsored the first Pan-American Conference in\n1889 between the US and Latin America. On the domestic front, his\nadministration secured passage of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, which was\npopular with the public, but it also passed the highly unpopular\nMcKinley Tariff Act and the even more unpopular Sherman Silver Purchase\nAct.

Yet history doesn't really support this\ncaricature of a man who actually was a highly intelligent and complex\nindividual.\nThough self-contained and terse, Coolidge was an extremely intelligent\nman and a fine scholar (his wedding gift to his wife, Grace Goodhue,\nwas his own translation of\nDante Alighieri (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0019604/?ls)\n's \"Inferno\".

Coolidge was a laissez-faire proponent, believing, like\nJefferson, that the government governs best which governs least. In\nJuly of 1924 his son, Calvin Jr., died of blood poisoning. The younger\nCoolidge, like his mother, was an outgoing and gregarious boy, and his\ndeath affected his father deeply. Although some historians have\ncharacterized Coolidge's behavior in office as marked by laziness or\nindolence, it seems now that it was almost certainly a deep depression\nbrought about by the death of his son.

His\nfamily were devout Quakers. At age eight, Hoover was orphaned and was\nsent to live with relatives. They showed him little affection, but\ntaught him the importance of hard work and industry. In 1891, Hoover\nentered Stanford University's School of Engineering, graduating in\n1895. Four years later, he married his wife, Lou Henry and they had two\nsons, Herbert Jr. and Allan. From an early age, Hoover showed a\nprodigious talent for engineering and was hired by the engineering firm\nBewick and Moering, working in Australia and then in China. He was in\nChina when the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 broke out and he coordinated the\nbarricades of Americans trapped in China. At age forty, his engineering\ncareer was so successful that he was a millionaire. 1914 saw the\noutbreak of World War I in Europe. That was when he left his\nengineering career and entered public service. He organized a relief\neffort to feed starving Belgians, known as the Commission for the\nRelief of Belgium. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, President\nWoodrow Wilson asked Hoover to organize the Food Administration, which\nencouraged Americans to cut down on food consumption to help the war\neffort. After the end of World War I in 1918, Hoover organized a\nmassive relief effort to feed starving peoples in Europe, whose\ncountries had been devastated by the war. From 1921 to 1929, Herbert\nHoover served as Secretary of Commerce, under Presidents Harding and\nCoolidge, expanding the department and making it more active in working\nwith business and labor. In 1928, he was the Republican candidate for\nPresident and easily defeated his opponent, the Democratic Candidate,\nAlfred E. Smith. Herbert Hoover was sworn in as President on March 4,\n1929. Seven months after he entered office, the Stock Market crashed,\nending the \"Roaring Twenties\" and the economic boom of that decade and\nushered in the Great Depression. At first, Hoover was proactive in\nhandling this economic crisis, having meetings with business leaders on\nhow to weather the economic downturn, cutting taxes and increasing\nmoney for corporations and state governments. But none of this was\neffective in the teeth of the worst economic crisis in American\nhistory. He tried to calm the situation with statements like\n\"Prosperity is just around the corner,\" but they were not effective.\nHis dour demeanor and seemingly callous attitudes towards the millions\nof unemployed were what people saw in him, particularly when he refused\nto provide direct relief to the unemployed. Things came to a head in\nthe summer of 1932 when the Bonus Expeditionary Force (BEF), an army of\nWorld War I veterans, marched to Washington demanding immediate payment\nof a bonus promised to them in 1945. But the veterans wanted their\nmoney now. They camped out along the Anacostia River and lobbied for\ntheir bonus. The House of Representatives approved immediate payment,\nbut the Senate voted no. Hoover obtained $100,000 from Congress to buy\nthe veterans train tickets home. Many veterans accepted the offer, but\nmany stayed in Washington. At that point, the US army led by Gen.\nDouglas McArthur forcibly evicted the veterans from Washington, setting\ntheir camps on fire and forcing them out at gunpoint. In so doing,\nMcArthur disobeyed Presidential orders, but Hoover took full\nresponsibility for the eviction of the Bonus Marchers. In the 1932\nelection, Herbert Hoover was defeated in a landslide by Democrat\nFranklin D. Roosevelt. After he left office in 1933, Hoover returned to\nCalifornia and was an unstinting critic of FDR. After the death of his\nwife in 1944, Hoover moved to New York City where he lived his last\ntwenty years at the Waldorf Towers, remaining active in Republican\nParty politics. In 1946, President Harry Truman asked him to undertake\nyet another relief effort for the people of Europe; he and Truman\nbecame surprisingly good friends. In 1953, Hoover chaired a commission\nto increase efficiency in the Executive Branch of the Federal\nGovernment.

FDR was a devoted\nson, but found clever and subtle ways to get around his mother's\ndomination. At 14 he was sent to Groton, an exclusive prep school led\nby the Rev. Endicott Peabody. FDR did not enjoy his time at Groton,\noften being teased by the other kids for having a formal and stuffy\nmanner. Since he had a nephew who was older than him, kids at Groton\ncalled him \"Uncle Frank\". He graduated from Groton in 1900 and went to\nHarvard, where he edited the \"Crimson\" but failed to be accepted into\nthe Porcellian Social Club. He graduated Harvard in 1903. Soon after\nthat he fell madly in love with his sixth cousin,\nEleanor Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740482/?ls)\n. They married in\n1905, with President\nTheodore Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740485/?ls)\ngiving the bride\naway. However, from the start Franklin and Eleanor's marriage was not a\nhappy one. She was quiet and shy, whereas he was boisterous and\noutgoing. The fact that his mother moved into the house next door to\ntheirs, and ran things, did not help. Franklin and Eleanor had six\nchildren (one child died in infancy). In 1910 Franklin was elected to\nthe New York State Legislature from Duchess County. There he made a\nname for himself as a crusading reformer who favored the \"average guy\"\nover big business and championed for honest government. In 1913 he was\nappointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy and served under\nJosephus Daniels (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199993/?ls)\nand President\nWoodrow Wilson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934306/?ls)\n. In 1918 he began\na love affair with his wife's social secretary, Lucy Mercer. When\nEleanor discovered the affair, she was understandably devastated and\ntold Franklin she wanted a divorce. At the urging of his mother,\nFrankilin chose to save the marriage and promised Eleanor that he would\nnever have anything more to do with Lucy. The damage was done, however,\nand Franklin and Eleanor never again shared the intimacies of marriage,\nbecoming more like political partners. In 1921 FDR was stricken with\npolio and paralyzed. He permanently lost the use of his legs, but\nrefused to let that thwart his political ambitions. He spoke at the\n1924 Democratic Convention for the candidacy of\nAlfred E. Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0808341/?ls)\n, then the\nGovernor of New York, calling him the \"Happy Warrior\". In 1928 FDR was\nelected Governor of New York and was well placed when the stock market\ncrashed in 1929. As governor he took the lead in providing relief and\npublic works projects for the millions of unemployed in the state. His\nsuccess as New York's governor made him a strong candidate for the\nPresidency in 1932. He easily beat incumbent President\nHerbert Hoover (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393885/?ls)\n.\nWhen Franklin Roosevelt was sworn in as President on March 4, 1933,\nmore than 15 million Americans were unemployed. Millions more had been\nhard hit by the Depression and the banking system had collapsed. FDR\nwasted no time in launching a radical economic recovery program, known\nas the New Deal. He created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC), which made the federal government the guarantor of people's\nbank deposits - not the banks themselves - and allowed drought-stricken\nfarmers to refinance their mortgages, He created public works programs\nincluding the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Civilian\nConservation Corps (CCC)--thus making the government the employer of\nlast resort--as well as setting up the Social Security system,\ninstituting a minimum wage, outlawing child labor--a widespread\npractice at the time, especially in mines, factories and textile\nmills--and mandating a 40-hour work week with overtime pay. In\nresponding to the Depression, FDR forever changed the role of the\nfederal government in American life. He was easily reelected in 1936,\ndefeating Republican Alf Landon in a landslide. His second term as\npresident was less successful than his first, however. The Supreme\nCourt had ruled a number of New Deal measures unconstitutional. With an\nelectoral mandate in the bank, FDR proposed \"packing\" the Supreme Court\nwith justices of his political persuasion for every judge over the age\nof 70 that did not retire. However, Congress refused to pass the\nSupreme Court packing plan, and from that point on FDR was unable to\nget Congress to pass much of his legislation. Also, fascism was rising\nrapidly throughout Europe and Asia. Germany's\nAdolf Hitler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386944/?ls)\nand Italy's\nBenito Mussolini (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615907/?ls)\nhad both seized power\nand began to conquer other countries, such as Ethiopia, Austria and\nCzechoslovakia. FDR was unable to respond to the threats from Europe\nand Asia, however, because sentiment in the US was strongly\nisolationist and Congress had passed a series of neutrality laws that\ngave the President very little power to respond to international\naggression. World War II began in September 1939 when Hitler invaded\nPoland. Nine months later all of Western Europe had fallen to Hitler.\nThe UK and its Commonwealth and Empire was standing alone. FDR wanted to help Britain, but had\nto move carefully and skillfully. He negotiated a deal in which the US\ngave Britain 50 old destroyers in exchange for bases in the Western\nHemisphere. With World War II underway, FDR took the unprecedented move\nof seeking a third term as president. He won that term in November\n1940, defeating Republican\nWendell Willkie (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932521/?ls)\n. Safely re-elected, he\nproposed a radical new program for helping Britain, known as\nLend-Lease, in which Britain could buy armaments and other supplies\nfrom the US but not have to pay for them until after the war. FDR used\nthe analogy of borrowing a neighbor's hose to put out a house fire to\nsell Lend-Lease. It passed and America became the \"arsenal of\ndemocracy\" as it began to build armaments for Britain and then the Soviet Union,\nwhen Hitler invaded it in mid-1941. Roosevelt met Britain's Prime\nMinister,\nWinston Churchill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0161476/?ls)\n,\nfor the first time in August 1941 where they drew up the Atlantic\nCharter. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise attack\non Pearl Harbor, destroying much of America's Pacific fleet. The next\nday,FDR declared war on Japan, calling December 7 \"a date that will\nlive in infamy.\" America was in the war, and not only against Japan,\nbut also against Germany and Italy. Under FDR's leadership, America quickly\ntransformed itself from a decaying nation of idle factories,\nimpoverished families, abandoned farms and masses of hobos roaming the\nstreets to a nation turning out planes, tanks, guns, military vehicles\nand other armaments on a scale that quickly dwarfed the capability of\nNazi Germany to do the same. World War II also changed American life as\nblacks got better jobs in the war plants and women began working\noutside the home in unprecedented numbers. Helped by Eleanor, FDR used\nthe war as a vehicle for social progress, securing better treatment for\nminorities and women, higher wages and better benefits for workers and\na GI bill, which guaranteed a free college education for all American\nsoldiers who fought in the war. In so doing, he created the American\nmiddle class of today.\nAfter a series of military defeats, the US and its allies began to win\nthe war. Invasions of North Africa and Italy were launched and the US\nstarted retaking islands in the South Pacific it had lost to Japan at\nthe beginning of the war, starting with the Battle of Midway in 1942.\nFDR met with Churchill several times throughout the war and with Soviet\nleader\nJoseph Stalin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0821672/?ls)\nat Tehran in 1943 and\nat Yalta in 1945. The Allied invasion of France, known as D-Day, was\nlaunched on June 6, 1944. As the war ended, FDR pushed for his dream of\na United Nations and for reforms that would ensure that another World\nWar would never happen. The United Nations did come to pass, as well as\nnew global institutions such as the World Bank and IMF. Also, FDR\nadvocated for decolonization of Africa and Asia, leading to the\ncollapse of the old European empires.\nBecause of the war, FDR felt he had no right to leave the presidency\nwhile Americans under his command were still fighting. So he sought a\nfourth term in 1944. His opponent was the new governor of New York,\nThomas E. Dewey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223150/?ls)\n, who ran a campaign of\ninnuendo, hinting that FDR was too ill to lead and that his government\nhad gone stale. FDR retaliated with a speech accusing the Republicans\nof attacking his dog, Fala. FDR won his fourth term in November 1944.\nIn January 1945 he journeyed to Yalta to confer with Churchill and\nStalin for the last time, to settle the postwar world and push for\nRussian participation in the United Nations. By this time FDR was\ngravely ill. After the Yalta Conference, he traveled to his resort at\nWarm Springs, Georgia, where he died suddenly of a massive stroke on\nApril 12, 1945. It was revealed that Lucy Mercer, his one-time lover,\nwas with him when he died and that she had secretly visited him in the\nWhite House a number of times during his last year.\nThere was an elaborate funeral for him, with a train procession from\nWarm Springs to Washington DC, then to Hyde Park, where he was buried.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874288/?ref_=ls_i_28)\n28.

Eisenhower was born on Tuesday, October 14, 1890, as Dwight David Eisenhower, in Denison, Texas. He was the third of seven sons born to David Jacob Eisenhower and Ida Elizabeth Stover. Both of his parents were of German descent. Eisenhower studied at the West Point Military Academy from 1911-1915. He served with the infantry, became the #3 leader of the tank corps, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel by the end of the First World War. From 1922-1924 he served in the Panama Canal Zone as executive officer to General, Fox Conner. From 1925-1926 he studied at the Command and General Staff College in Kansas, and from 1928-1933 he served as executive officer to Gen. George V. Moseley: Assistant Secretary of War, in Washington, DC.\nEisenhower was chief military aide to Gen.\nDouglas MacArthur (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0531274/?ls)\nfrom 1933-1935. He accompanied MacArthur to the Philippines in 1935, and served there as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government until 1939. Back in Washington, he held various staff positions and was promoted to Brigadier General in September 1941. Shortly after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, on Sunday, December 7th, 1941. Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff. There he gradually rose to Assistant Chief of Staff under the Chief of Staff, Gen.\nGeorge C. Marshall (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0550895/?ls)\n. Although Eisenhower had no experience in active military command, Marshall recognized his organizational and administrative strength. It was his association with Marshall that brought Eisenhower to London in June 1942 as Commanding General of the European Theater of Operations. He was also appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces of the North African Theater of Operations, which was renamed the Mediterranean Theater of Operations after the capitulation of the German army in Africa. In September of 1943 Eisenhower oversaw the Allied invasion of Sicily and then of Italy, which led to the immediate surrender of Italian forces in southern Italy. However, the German Winter Line fortifications in Italy, kept fighting even after the fall of Berlin.\nEisenhower was in charge of planning and carrying out the Allied landings in Normandy, France, and the invasion of Germany. The first part of his plan, named Operation Overlord, was the largest seaborne operation in history. Under this plan, 2.8 million Allied troops from 12 nations crossed the English Channel. Starting on Tuesday, June 6th, 1944, known as \"D-Day\", they landed on the beaches of Normandy, France. After extremely fierce heavy fighting, the Allies breached the fortifications and pushed back the defending German forces. Two months later they reached Paris.\nAdolf Hitler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386944/?ls)\nhad ordered the German commander of Paris to destroy the city rather than let it fall into Allied hands, but that officer refused to carry out those orders and eventually surrendered the city to the Allies. After fighting that was not as fierce as was expected, the city of Paris was liberated on Friday, August 25th, 1944. Eisenhower was with French Gen.\nCharles de Gaulle (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0208540/?ls)\nat the Hotel de Ville, where they greeted the Allied forces and took part in the French victory parade. After liberating Belgium and the Netherlands, the Allied troops crossed into Germany. In 1945 US and Soviet armies linked up on the Elbe River, west of Berlin. Soon Eisenhower met with Russian Gen.\nGeorgi Zhukov (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955850/?ls)\nand the two made a trip to the Soviet Union; the first (and only) time Eisenhower did so. After the German surrender on Tuesday, May 8th, 1945, Eisenhower was made the Military Governor of the US Occupied Zone in Germany, based in Frankfurt. He ordered the detailed search, documentation, photographing and widespread dissemination of what went on in the Nazi death camps. By actions such as these, Eisenhower began the process of documenting the horrors of the Holocaust.\nAlthough he had never been in action himself, Eisenhower was respected as a brilliant military strategist and skilled political leader during the Second World War. He successfully dealt with conflicting demands from many sides, and managed to mollify such tough and determined personalities as\nWinston Churchill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0161476/?ls)\n,\nJoseph Stalin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0821672/?ls)\n, Gen.\nBernard L. Montgomery (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0599728/?ls)\nand Gen.\nGeorge S. Patton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0666567/?ls)\n. From 1945 to 1948 Eisenhower was Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, and from 1950-1952 was Supreme Commander of all NATO forces.\nEisenhower won the 1952 US presidential elections, with\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\nas his Vice President, and brought the Republicans back to national power after 20 years. He was President from 1953-1960, becoming the first and only army general to serve as President in the 20th Century, formally becoming a civilian during his term in office. He ended the Korean War and offered peaceful co-existence with the Soviet Union after the death of Stalin in 1953. He authorized the 1953 Iranian coup d'etat and the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat. He invited\nNikita Khrushchev (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451979/?ls)\nto his first visit to the US in 1959, and hosted him at his farm at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where his children and grandchildren met the family of the Soviet leader. Shortly after that, however, the Soviets shot down an American U2 spy plane, captured the pilot and canceled Eisenhower's reciprocal visit to the Soviet Union. Relations between the two superpowers deteriorated very quickly, leading to an increasingly rapid nuclear arms race and a dangerous standoff in the Cold War.\nDomestically, Eisenhower began the modernization and integration of American roads into the interstate highway system, modeled after the autobahn, which he saw in Germany. In spite of some serious setbacks with US-Soviet relations, overall his presidency was a successful example of a non-partisan approach to politics.\nAfter his presidential term expired (US Presidents can only serve two terms), Eisenhower was again commissioned a five-star general in the army. He lived in retirement on his farm in Gettysburg, where he wrote his memoirs. He died on Friday, March 28th, 1969, at the Army Hospital in Washington, DC, and was laid to rest in Abilene, Kansas, at the Eisenhower Presidential Library.\nThe complete lifetime of\nDwight D. Eisenhower (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252032/?ls)\n, was from Tuesday, October 14th, 1890, to Friday, March 28th, 1969. He lived 28,654 days, equaling 4,093 weeks & 3 days.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448123/?ref_=ls_i_30)\n30. John F.

Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448132/?ls)\n. John was named\nafter his maternal grandfather, John \"HoneyFitz\" Fitzgerald, the mayor\nof Boston. John was very ill as a child and was given the last rites\nfive times, the first one being when he was a new-born. He was the\nsecond of four boys born to an Irish Catholic family with nine\nchildren: Joseph Jr., John,\nRobert F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448305/?ls)\n(called Bobby), and\nTed Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448356/?ls)\n(born Edward). Because\nRose made Joe and Jack (the name his family called him) wear matching\nclothes, they fought a lot for attention. When John was young, the\nfamily moved from Boston to New York. John went to Choate, a private\nschool. Most of the time, though, he was too sick to attend. In the\nlate 1930s, father Joe became the ambassador to England. He took sons\nJohn and Robert with him, as well as his wife and daughters Kathleen\nand\nRosemary Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1812993/?ls)\n. John went\nto Princeton, then Harvard, and for his senior thesis, he wrote a piece\nabout why England refused to get into the war until late. It was\npublished in 1940 and called \"Why England Slept\". His older brother Joe\nwas a pilot during the war, and was killed when the bombs his plane was\ncarrying exploded. Not long after that, John's sister Kathleen and her\nhusband died in a plane crash. In the early 1950s, John ran for\nCongress in Massachusetts and won. He married\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448080/?ls)\n(née Jacqueline Lee Bouvier) on September 12, 1953.\nTheir daughter,\nCaroline Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0447952/?ls)\n, was born on\nNovember 27, 1957 and their son,\nJohn Kennedy Jr. (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0447882/?ls)\n, was born on November\n25, 1960. They also had a stillborn daughter named Arabella and a son named Patrick\nBouvier, who died a few days after birth. In 1954, J.F.K. had to\nhave back surgery and in the hospital wrote his second book, \"Profiles\nin Courage\". His father always said that his son Joe was going to be\nPresident of the U.S.; when he died in World War II, though, that task\nwas passed on to John. He ran for president in 1960 against\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\nand narrowly won. His administration\nhad many conflicts, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis being\nkey examples. In November 1963, he and Jackie (his wife's nickname)\nwent on a trip to Texas. Everywhere they went there were signs saying\n\"Jack and Jackie.\" On November 22, 1963, John was to give a speech in\nDallas, but on his way an assassin hidden on the sixth floor of the\nTexas School Book Depository opened fire at Kennedy, who was riding in\nan open car.

His parents separated two weeks after his birth and his mother took him to Grand Rapids, Michigan to live with her parents. On February 1, 1916, his mother Dorothy married Gerald R. Ford, a paint salesman. The Fords began calling their son Gerald R. Ford, Jr. but the name became legal only on December 3, 1935. Aged 13, Ford knew that Gerald Sr., was not his biological father, but it wasn't until 1930 he met his biological father Leslie King, who had made an unexpected stop in Grand Rapids.\nFord grew up in a family with three younger half-brothers, Thomas, Richard, and James. He attended South High School in Grand Rapids, where he already showed his athletics skills, being named to the honor society and the \"All-City\" and \"All-State\" football teams. As a scout he was ranked Eagle Scout in November 1927. He earned money by working in the family paint business and at a local restaurant.\nFord attended The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor from 1931 to 1935. He majored in economics and political science and graduated with a B.A. degree in June 1935. He played on the University's national championship football teams in 1932 and 1933 and was voted MVP of Wolverine in 1934. He also played in All-Star and benefit football games. He denied offers from two professional football teams, (Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers), but chose to become boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach at Yale hoping to attend law school there. Ford earned his law degree in 1941.\nAfter returning to Michigan and passing his bar exam, Ford set up a law partnership in Grand Rapids with Philip Buchen, a University of Michigan fraternity brother (who later served on Ford's White House staff as Counsel to the President).\nIn April 1942 Ford joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and became a physical fitness instructor at a flight school in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In the spring of 1943 he began service in the light aircraft carrier USS Monterey. Ford spent the remainder of the war ashore and was discharged as a lieutenant commander in February 1946. He returned to Grand Rapids to become a partner in the locally prestigious law firm of Butterfield, Keeney, and Amberg.\nHis first political experience was in the summer of 1940 when he was working in the presidential campaign of Wendell Willkie. Six years later he decided to challenge Bartel Jonkman for the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1948 election. Ford won the nomination and after that was elected to Congress on November 2, 1948, receiving 61% of the vote.\nOn October 15 1948, the height of the campaign, Ford married Elizabeth ('Betty') Anne Bloomer Warren, a department store fashion consultant. Betty was born on April 8, 1918 in Chicago, Illinois, but grew up in Grand Rapids. They subsequently had four children: Michael Gerald (March 14, 1950), John Gardner (March 16, 1952), Steven Meigs (May 19, 1956) and Susan Elizabeth (July 6, 1957).\nFord served in the House of Representatives from January 3, 1949 to December 6, 1973. He was re-elected twelve times, winning each time with more than 60% of the vote. As his ambition was to become Speaker of the House already in the early 1950s, he denied offers to run for both the Senate and the Michigan governorship in these years. In 1961 he became chairman of the House Republican Conference. In 1963 President Johnson appointed Ford to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was the last living member of the Warren Commission.\nIn 1965 Ford was chosen as the House minority leader, a post he held until 1973. As minority leader Ford made more than 200 speeches a year all across the country, which made him nationally known. He was not only a close friend of Richard Nixon for many years, but also a loyal supporter in both the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections. As in 1960, Ford was again considered as a vice presidential candidate in 1968. Because the Republicans did not attain a majority in the House, Ford was unable to reach his ultimate political goal, Speaker of the House. Instead, he became President of the Senate.\nLate in 1973 Spiro Agnew pleaded no contest to a charge of income tax evasion and resigned as Vice President. President Nixon was empowered by the 25th Amendment to appoint a new vice president and chose Ford. He was sworn in on December 6, 1973.\nOn August 9, 1974, Nixon became the first president in U.S. history to resign from the office under the threat of impeachment in the Watergate scandal. The same day Gerald R. Ford took the oath of office as 38th President of the United States on August 9, 1974. Also in August 1974, Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller for vice president, which nomination was confirmed by Congress on December 19, 1974.\nOne month after taking office President Ford faced one of the toughest decisions in his career. He decided to grant Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon for all offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in. The public opinion was mostly negative about the pardon and there was even suspicion Ford and Nixon had made a deal to grant a pardon if Nixon would resign. Although this happened on September 8, 1974, it might have cost the re-election of Ford two years later.\nOn November 24, 1974, in the conference hall of the Okeansky Sanitarium, Vladivostok, USSR, President Ford and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev signed the SALT-treaty, following talks on the limitation of strategic offensive arms.\nIn March 1975, during the final days of the Vietnam War, Ford ordered the airlift of about 237,000 Vietnamese refugees to the United States. Two months later, on May 14, 1975, Ford ordered U.S. forces to retake the S.S. Mayaguez after its seizure by Cambodia, an action Ford characterized as an \"act of piracy.\" The operation saved the ship's 39-member crew, but sadly 41 Americans were killed and 50 more wounded during the preparation and execution of the rescue.\nPresident Ford was twice the target of assassination attempts. Both took place in on two separate trips to California in September 1975 and both were 'performed' by women. On September 5, 1975 he survived an assassination attempt in Sacramento, California, by Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, a member of a cult once led by convicted mass murderer Charles Manson. On September 22, 1975, in San Francisco, California, Sara Jane Moore fired a shot at the president, but a bystander diverted the shot.\nDespite his former athletics skills, Gerald Ford tumbled several times during his presidency. No cause was ever communicated. At the Republican National Convention in August 1976, Ford fought off a serious challenge from Californian Governor Ronald Reagan to be nominated as his party's presidential candidate. He chose Senator Robert Dole of Kansas as his running mate.\nAlthough he succeeded in closing in on Democrat Jimmy Carter's large lead in the polls, President Ford finally lost one of the closest elections in history in November 1976. After leaving office, Gerald and Betty Ford returned to private life and moved to California where they built a new house in Rancho Mirage, which became his last residence.\nPresident Ford continued to actively participate in the political process and to speak out on important political issues. He lectured at hundreds of colleges and universities. In 1981, the Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, were dedicated.\nPresident Ford was the recipient of numerous awards and honors by many civic organizations, like the recipient of many honorary Doctor of Law degrees from various public and private colleges and universities.\nIn August 1999, President Bill Clinton presented Ford with the nation's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom. Two months later, in\nOctober 1999, Senate and House leaders presented Ford and his wife, Betty, with the Congressional Gold Medal. Together with former President Carter, he served as honorary Co-Chair of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001. In May 2001 he was presented with the Profiles in Courage award for his controversial decision to pardon former President Nixon.\nIn August 2000 Ford suffered a mild stroke while attending the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On May 16, 2003 following fluctuations in blood pressure and hot weather, Ford suffered dizzy spells on the golf course and taken to hospital. He was released the next day.\nAlthough President Ford cut back on his travel and public appearances in recent years, he attended funeral services for President Ronald Reagan at Washington's National Cathedral, sitting with former Presidents Clinton, Bush and Carter, and their wives in June 2004.\nIn August 2006, he was discharged from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, after doctors tried to reduce or eliminate blockages in his coronary arteries. They also implanted a pacemaker to improve his heart performance. In the fall of 2006 Ford spent several days at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage for medical tests. He was released on October 16.\nOn November 12, 2006, Ford officially became the longest-lived president, surpassing Ronald Reagan. Ford would extend the record by 45 days.\nOn December 26, 2006 at 6:45 p.m., President Ford died in his house in Rancho Mirage, California. He was aged 93 years and 165 days old, making him the longest-lived United States President. No cause of death was communicated. A state funeral and memorial services were held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on January 2, 2007. President Ford was buried at his presidential museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nPresident Gerald Ford was survived by his wife Betty, after more than 58 years of marriage, and by their four children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. He was also survived by his brother, Richard, of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141699/?ref_=ls_i_34)\n34.

Ronald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ref_=ls_t_35)\nActor\nProduction Manager\nAdditional Crew\nKings Row (1942) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034946/?ref_=ls_knf_35)\nRonald Reagan had quite a prolific career, having catapulted from a Warner Bros. contract player and television star, into serving as president of the Screen Actors Guild, the governorship of California (1967-1975), and lastly, two terms as President of the United States (1981-1989).\nRonald Wilson Reagan was born in Tampico, Illinois, to Nelle Clyde (Wilson) and John Edward \"Jack\" Reagan, who was a salesman and storyteller. His father was of Irish descent, and his mother was of half Scottish and half English ancestry.\nA successful actor beginning in the 1930s, the young Reagan was a staunch admirer of President\nFranklin D. Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740483/?ls)\n(even after he evolved into a Republican), and was a Democrat in the 1940s, a self-described 'hemophiliac' liberal. He was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1947 and served five years during the most tumultuous times to ever hit Hollywood. A committed anti-communist, Reagan not only fought more-militantly activist movie industry unions that he and others felt had been infiltrated by communists, but had to deal with the investigation into Hollywood's politics launched by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947, an inquisition that lasted through the 1950s. The House Un-American Activities Committee investigations of Hollywood (which led to the jailing of the \"Hollywood Ten\" in the late '40s) sowed the seeds of the McCarthyism that racked Hollywood and America in the 1950s.\nIn 1950, U.S. Representative\nHelen Gahagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0301099/?ls)\nDouglas (D-CA), the wife of \"Dutch\" Reagan's friend\nMelvyn Douglas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002048/?ls)\n, ran as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate and was opposed by the Republican nominee, the Red-bating Congressman from Whittier,\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\n. While Nixon did not go so far as to accuse Gahagan Douglas of being a communist herself, he did charge her with being soft on communism due to her opposition to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Nixon tarred her as a \"fellow traveler\" of communists, a \"pinko\" who was \"pink right down to her underwear.\" Gahagan Douglas was defeated by the man she was the first to call \"Tricky Dicky\" because of his unethical behavior and dirty campaign tactics. Reagan was on the Douglases' side during that campaign.\nThe Douglases, like Reagan and such other prominent actors as\nHumphrey Bogart (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000007/?ls)\nand\nEdward G. Robinson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000064/?ls)\n, were liberal Democrats, supporters of the late\nFranklin D. Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740483/?ls)\nand his New Deal, a legacy that increasingly was under attack by the right after World War II. They were NOT fellow-travelers; Melvyn Douglas had actually been an active anti-communist and was someone the communists despised. Melvyn Douglas, Robinson and\nHenry Fonda (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000020/?ls)\n- a registered Republican! - wound up \"gray-listed.\" (They weren't explicitly black-listed, they just weren't offered any work.) Reagan, who it was later revealed had been an F.B.I. informant while a union leader (turning in suspected communists), was never hurt that way, as he made S.A.G. an accomplice of the black-listing.\nReagan's career sagged after the late 1940s, and he started appearing in B-movies after he left Warner Bros. to go free-lance. However, he had a eminence grise par excellence in\nLew Wasserman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1348282/?ls)\n, his agent and the head of the Music Corp. of America. Wasserman, later called \"The Pope of Hollywood,\" was the genius who figured out that an actor could make a killing via a tax windfall by turning himself into a corporation. The corporation, which would employ the actor, would own part of a motion picture the actor appeared in, and all monies would accrue to the corporation, which was taxed at a much lower rate than was personal income. Wasserman pioneered this tax avoidance scheme with his client\nJames Stewart (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000071/?ls)\n, beginning with the\nAnthony Mann (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0542649/?ls)\nwestern\nWinchester '73 (1950) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043137/?ls)\n(1950). It made Stewart enormously rich as he became a top box office draw in the 1950s after the success of \"Winchester 73\" and several more Mann-directed westerns, all of which he had an ownership stake in.\nIronically, Reagan became a poor-man's James Stewart in the early 1950s, appearing in westerns, but they were mostly B-pictures. He did not have the acting chops of the great Stewart, but he did have his agent. Wasserman at M.C.A. was one of the pioneers of television syndication, and this was to benefit Reagan enormously. M.C.A. was the only talent agency that was also allowed to be a producer through an exemption to union rules granted by S.A.G. when Reagan was the union president, and it used the exemption to acquire Universal International Pictures. Talent agents were not permitted to be producers as there was an inherent conflict of interest between the two professions, one of which was committed to acquiring talent at the lowest possible cost and the other whose focus was to get the best possible price for their client. When a talent agent was also a producer, like M.C.A. was, it had a habit of steering its clients to its own productions, where they were employed but at a lower price than their potential free market value. It was a system that made M.C.A. and Lew Wasserman, enormously wealthy.\nThe ownership of Universal and its entry into the production of television shows that were syndicated to network made M.C.A. the most successful organization in Hollywood of its time, a real cash cow as television overtook the movies as the #1 business of the entertainment industry. Wasserman repaid Ronald Reagan's largess by structuring a deal by which he hosted and owned part of\nGeneral Electric Theater (1953) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045395/?ls)\n, a western omnibus showcase that ran from 1954 to 1961. It made Reagan very comfortable financially, though it did not make him rich. That came later.\nIn 1960, with the election of the Democratic President\nJohn F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448123/?ls)\n, the black and gray lists went into eclipse. J.F.K. appointed Helen Gahagan Douglas Treasurer of the United States. About this time, as the civil rights movement became stronger and found more support among Democrats and the Kennedy administration, Reagan - fresh from a second stint as S.A.G. president in 1959 - was in the process of undergoing a personal and political metamorphosis into a right-wing Republican, a process that culminated with his endorsing\nBarry Goldwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326400/?ls)\nfor the Republican presidential nomination in 1964. (He narrated a Goldwater campaign film played at the G.O.P. Convention in San Francisco.) Reagan's evolution into a right-wing Republican sundered his friendship with the Douglases. (After Reagan was elected President of the United States in 1980, Melvyn Douglas said of his former friend that Reagan turned to the right after he had begun to believe the pro-business speeches he delivered for General Electric when he was the host of the \"G.E. Theater.\")\nIn 1959, while Reagan was back as a second go-round as S.A.G. president, M.C.A.'s exemption from S.A.G. regulations that forbade a talent agency from being a producer was renewed. However, in 1962, the U.S. Justice Department under Attorney General\nRobert F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448305/?ls)\nsuccessfully forced M.C.A. - known as \"The Octopus\" in Hollywood for its monopolistic tendencies - to divest itself of its talent agency.\nWhen Reagan was tipped by the California Republican Party to be its standard-bearer in the 1965 gubernatorial election against Democratic Governor Pat Brown, Lew Wasserman went back in action. Politics makes strange bedfellows, and though Wasserman was a liberal Democrat, having an old friend like Reagan who had shown his loyalty as S.A.G. president in the state house was good for business. Wasserman and his partner, M.C.A. Chairman Jules Styne (a Republican), helped ensure that Reagan would be financially secure for the rest of his life so that he could enter politics. (At the time, he was the host of \"Death Valley Days\" on TV.)\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Universal sold Reagan a nice piece of land of many acres north of Santa Barbara that had been used for location shooting. The Reagans sold most of the ranch, then converted the rest of it, about 200 acres, into a magnificent estate overlooking the valley and the Pacific Ocean. The Rancho del Cielo became President Reagan's much needed counterpoint to the buzz of Washington, D.C. There, in a setting both rugged and serene, the Reagans could spend time alone or receive political leaders such as the Soviet President\nMikhail Gorbachev (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329784/?ls)\n, Margaret Thatcher, and others.\nReagan was known to the world for his one-liners, the most famous of them was addressed to\nMikhail Gorbachev (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329784/?ls)\nin 1987. \"Mister Gorbachev, tear down this wall\" said Reagan standing in front of the Berlin Wall. That call made an impact on the course of human history.\nRonald Reagan played many roles in his life's seven acts: radio announcer, movie star, union boss, television actor-cum-host, governor, right-wing critic of big government and President of the United States.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124132/?ref_=ls_i_36)\n36.

Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124133/?ls)\n, the 43rd president of the U.S., who is known as \"Bush 43\"), was born on June 12, 1924 in Milton, Massachusetts, a suburb south of Boston. His parents were Dorothy (Walker) and\nPrescott Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1778210/?ls)\n, who was then the president of sales for the Stedman Products Co. of South Braintree, Massachusetts. In 1925, Prescott joined the United States Rubber Co. (New York, NY) as their foreign division manager, necessitating a move to Greenwich, Connecticut.\nPrescott Bush (Yale 1917) made his fortune and name as an investment banker on Wall St., eventually becoming a partner of the white shoe brokerage Brown Bros. Harriman. He was a member of the Yale Corp., the principal governing body of Yale University, from 1944 to 1956 and was on the board of directors of the Columbia Broadcasting System (C.B.S.), after having been introduced to C.B.S. Chairman\nWilliam Paley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1013200/?ls)\nin 1932 by his friend and business partner\nAverell Harriman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364207/?ls)\n, a major Democratic party power-broker.\nGeorge Bush was educated at the exclusive Greenwich Country Day School in Greenwich, Connecticut before moving on to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he matriculated from 1936 to 1942. At Phillips Andover, he captained the baseball and soccer teams and was a member of an exclusive fraternity called the A.U.V, or \"Auctoritas, Unitas, Veritas\", Latin for \"Authority, Unity, Truth\". Like his father before him, Bush was on schedule to attend Yale College and would have in the fall of 1942, but for the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor by the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941 that necessitated the entry of the United States into World War II.\nUpon his graduation from Phillips Andover, George Bush enlisted in the U.S. Navy on June 12, 1942, his 18th birthday, with the intent on becoming an aviator. After completing the 10-month naval aviation course, he was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve three days before his nineteenth birthday, which made him the youngest naval aviator ever at the time.\nGeorge Bush married the former Barbara Pierce on January 6, 1945, and after he was demobilized, they moved to New Haven, Connecticut so that he could attend Yale, where he proved a fine student and captained the baseball team, which made it to the first College World Series. They had their first of six children, future President George Walker Bush, two days after the Fourth of July, 1946. In his senior year, George Bush was tapped for the exclusive secret society Skull & Bones, as had been his father (and as his son would be).\nUsing his father's connections and $2 million in seed money from his relatives (approximately $17 million in 2006 terms), George Bush prospered in the oil industry after graduating from Yale in 1949. Through his father's business and social relationship with a fellow Skull & Bones member, George Bush secured a position with Dresser Industries, on whose board of directors Prescott had served for 22 years.\nAs the son of a moderate Republican senator, it was natural that George Bush would stand for office. At the time, the \"Solid South\" was solidly Democratic, with the Republican Party of Civil War winner (and Civil Rights champion) Abraham Lincoln anathema below the Mason-Dixon line.Good Republican candidates were hard to come by (though John Tower later proved that a Republican could win in the Deep South when he took a Senate seat in 1966). One year after his father left the Seante, his son George stood won the Republican nomination to oppose Democratic Senator Ralph Yarborough, an ally of President 'Lyndon Johnson (I)' (QB), who was on his way to defeating Republican Presidential nominee\nBarry Goldwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326400/?ls)\nin an electoral landslide in 1964. Riding the coat-tails of favorite son Johnson, Yarborough handily won reelection, keeping George Bush in the private sector for two more years.\nBush stood for a House seat in 1966 and won, then won reelection in 1968. In Congress, he established a reputation as a liberal Republican and was known as a supporter of contraception services (his father, Prescott, had been a mainstay of Planned Parenthood). At the request of President\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\n, Bush gave up his seat voluntarily in 1970 to seek the Senate seat of Democratic Senator Ralph Yarborough, who was a fierce Nixon critic. It was felt that Yaborough's liberalism made him vulnerable to a challenge from the right, and it did; however, it was the right-wing of the Democratic Party. Lloyd Bentsen won the Democratic nomination and, endorsed by Yarborough, beat Bush handily in the November general election. (Ironically, Bentsen would one day be the running mate of Bush's 1988 rival for the presidency,\nMichael Dukakis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0241144/?ls)\n.) One of the reason for Bush's defeat was that with Yarborough out of the race, Nixon's support for Bush's campaign was only half-hearted.\nAs a payback to Bush, Nixon appointed him Ambassador to the United Nations, and he later served Nixon as the Chairman of the Republican National Committee during the Watergate crisis. Nixon's successor in the Oval Office,\nGerald Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004934/?ls)\n, briefly considered appointing Bush as his replacement as vice president before going with liberal Republican stalwart\nNelson Rockefeller (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734224/?ls)\n, the four-term governor of the State of New York, but Ford eventually appointed Bush as the first American plenipotentiary to Communist China, then later director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\nAfter losing the 1980 Republican nomination to\nRonald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ls)\n, Bush was chosen as Reagan's running mate and elected Vice President of the United States in Reagan's victory over incumbent President\nJimmy Carter (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141699/?ls)\nin November. In 1988, Bush as vice president was Reagan's heir apparent, and he won the Republican nomination handily, though personally he was not very popular. Bush was perceived as \"weak\" due to his social liberalism, which included support for abortion rights and contraception. As a \"Rockefeller Republican\" (that is, an Eastern Establishment pro-business Republican who is moderate or liberal on social issues), Bush, unlike Reagan, was out-of-step in an increasingly conservative party dominated by voters from the South and West. The well-educated, thoughtful Bush, according to Reagan biographer Edmund Morris, was a genuinely nice and gracious person, and more importantly: sincere. However, he was perceived as not standing for anything, at least not in the stark black & white terms that had inspired the conservative if not reactionary Republican Party faithful during the two terms of the \"Great Communicator\".\nAs president, Bush saw the collapse of the Soviet Union, and he soared to unprecedented levels of public approval after his firm handling of\nSaddam Hussein (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0404010/?ls)\n's invasion of Kuwait pushed the Iraqi army out of the invaded kingdom with a minimum amount of U.S. casualties. However, his popularity plummeted by the time the campaign rolled around in 1992 due to his seeming inability to cope with a recession caused by economic dislocations linked to the end of the Cold War.\nAfter the presidency, George Bush prospered financially as a corporate speaker, reportedly making as much as $10 million from the Reverend\nSun Myung Moon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0600671/?ls)\n. Bush's business ventures through the Carlyle Group, a private equity fund with close ties to the government of Saudi Arabia, have proved very remunerative. Most importantly, he achieved a sort of personal vindication when his son, George Walker Bush, defeated Clinton's vice president, Al Gore, and was elected the 43rd President of the United States.\nIn the twilight of his years, comfortably retired from the political wars, Bush teamed with fellow ex-President Bill Clinton for a uniquely close relationship in which the two jointly led campaigns to help the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 devastation of the Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina via private sector fund-raising.\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush died on November 30, 2018, in Houston, Texas. He joined his wife Barbara, who had passed in April of that year.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001051/?ref_=ls_i_37)\n37.

His mother then moved to New Orleans. Bill Clinton initially grew up with his grandparents. In 1950 his mother returned to Hope. That same year she married car dealer Roger Clinton. As a member of a student delegation from the patriotic American Legion, Clinton met in Washington D.C. with President John F. Kennedy. Clinton was interested in politics from a young age. After graduating from high school, he studied international relations at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. until 1968. He then studied law at Yale and Oxford Universities on a scholarship until 1973. During his studies, Clinton was already involved in various student organizations. He played saxophone in a jazz band and supported himself as a staffer in the office of Senator J. William Fulbright. In 1968, Clinton received a \"Rhodes Scholarship\" that allowed him to travel to the University of Oxford, England.\nFrom 1970 he studied law at Yale University. After receiving his doctorate in 1973, he briefly worked for the House Judiciary Committee. From 1973 to 1976 he was appointed to the University of Arkansas School of Law. In 1974 he ran for a seat in the House of Representatives, but was narrowly defeated by the Republican incumbent John-Paul Hammerschmidt. In 1975, Bill Clinton married Hillary Rodham, Hillary Clinton. In 1976, Clinton was elected to the office of Attorney General of Arkansas. Two years later, in 1978, at just 32 years old, he was appointed governor of Arkansas, the youngest head of government of an American state at the time. After two years he resigned from the senatorial office. His daughter Chelsea was born in 1980. From 1980 to 1983, Bill Clinton worked at the law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings in Little Rock. At the end of 1983 he was re-elected as governor of Arkansas. In 1985 he became a co-founder of the \"Democratic Leadership Council\" and from 1990 its chairman.\nFrom 1986 to 1987, Clinton served as chairman of the National Governors Association. In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president. In July 1991 he was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate. Senator Al Gore, who was running for vice-presidency, went into the election campaign with him. Throughout the entire election campaign, Bill Clinton was in the lead by a clear margin, not least because of his successful connection to the historical myth of former President John F Kennedy. In the presidential election on November 3, 1992, Clinton won over the incumbent George H. W. Bush. He then moved into the White House on January 20, 1993 as the 42nd President of the United States of America. At 46, he was the third youngest president in the history of the United States, after Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. Clinton's top priorities during his term in office were the introduction of health insurance, reconciliation with Vietnam, and combating drug abuse, gun violence, and poverty in the United States and the world.\nOn foreign policy matters, Clinton visited Germany on July 10, 1994. In Berlin he gave a speech in which Clinton, like John F. Kennedy in 1963, said in German \"America is at your side - now and forever.\" In 1994 he received an honorary doctorate from Oxford University. In terms of foreign policy, he supported the Israeli-Jordanian peace process, which led to the peace treaty between the two countries. At the CSCE summit in Budapest in 1995, Clinton, Boris Yeltsin and the presidents of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan exchanged views on the instruments of ratification of the START I Agreement. The Treaty on the Reduction of Nuclear Weapons with a Range of More Than 5,500 km, signed in 1991, thus came into force. In the following presidential election in November 1996, Clinton was able to clearly assert himself in office against Bob Dole. The summit meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Clinton in Helsinki ended in March 1997 without an agreement on the dispute over NATO's eastern expansion. In May 1997, Clinton traveled to Mexico on an official visit. It was the first visit by a US president to the neighboring country since 1979.\nIn May 1997, the \"Basic Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between the North Atlantic Organization and the Russian Federation\" was signed in Paris. After a long budget dispute between the administration and Congress, an agreement on tax cuts was reached. The US budget was brought out of the red for the first time since 1969. President Clinton's second term was overshadowed by allegations of sexually assaulting government employee Paula Jones in a hotel room in 1991. Clinton denied the accusation.\nFor the first time in the history of the United States, a sitting president testified under oath on his own behalf on January 17, 1998. On January 26, 1998, Clinton reaffirmed his sworn statement that he had not had an extramarital affair with his intern, Monica Lewinsky. Clinton also rejected the accusation that he had incited Lewinsky to make false statements with an affidavit. For the first time in 130 years, i.e. H. Since the presidency of Andrew Johnson, impeachment proceedings have again been opened against an American president in office.\nClinton later revised his statement. However, at the end of the investigation in 1999, the allegations were not sufficient for either impeachment or indictment. In March 1998, Clinton became the first US president to undertake an extensive tour of southern Africa. As part of this trip, he announced debt relief for African reform states. Paula Jones' lawsuit against Clinton was dismissed by the Arkansas federal court in April 1998. After bombings at the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the US fired cruise missiles at six suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan in retaliation on August 20, 1998. In October 1998, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat signed a peace agreement in Washington at Clinton's initiative. This got the peace process in the Middle East, which had been stalled for almost two years, back on track. Despite protests from the Chinese government, Clinton received the Dalai Lama at the White House in November 1998. As a result of the 2000 hacker attacks on the World Wide Web, a conference on Internet security issues began in Washington. Clinton advocated for a national security center.\nOn June 2, 2000, during his visit to Germany, Bill Clinton became the first US president to receive the International Charlemagne Prize from the city of Aachen. In his laudatory speech, Gerhard Schröder praised Clinton's commitment to growing together in Europe. That same month, he became the first U.S. president to deliver a speech to the Russian parliament. He offered Russia comprehensive cooperation. During his three-day visit to Moscow, he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and privately visited former President Boris Yeltsin. At the turn of the millennium, Bill Clinton completed his term as one of the most successful presidents of the United States. Above all, his commitment to new companies and technologies gave the USA the longest economic rise in its history. His successor as US President was George W. Bush, who was sworn in as the 43rd President of the United States on February 20, 2001. On June 22, 2004, Bill Clinton published his biography entitled \"My Life\" in New York. The almost 1,000-page work was pre-ordered two million times before publication.\nBill Clinton underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery in New York on September 6, 2004, but he survived without incident. The former US President is committed to fighting poverty, corruption and climate change worldwide with his \"Clinton Global Initiative\", which held its first conference in New York in mid-September 2005. For his tireless efforts to help the poorest, Bill Clinton was awarded the German media prize \"Bambi\" by Hubert Burda Medien in the \"Charity\" category in Germany in December 2005. In 2007 he was honored with the TED Prize and in 2013 Clinton was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States of America's highest civilian honor, by Barack Obama.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124133/?ref_=ls_i_38)\n38. George W. Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124133/?ref_=ls_t_38)\nCamera and Electrical Department\nAdditional Crew\nSoundtrack\nJourneys with George (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312848/?ref_=ls_knf_38)\nThe 43rd President of the United States of America, George Walker Bush (known colloquially as \"W\" to distinguish himself from his father,\nGeorge Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124132/?ls)\n, the 41st president of the U.S.), was born two days after the national holiday of the Fourth of July, 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut. There, his father was attending Yale College in the Class of 1949. His mother was\nBarbara Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124093/?ls)\n(the former Barbara Pierce), whom his father had married on January 6, 1945. \"W\" was their first child. Bush disliked being called \"Junior\" or Bush II, or even having the term \"Jr.\" abbreviated next to his name.\nInitially, W's prospects of living up to his illustrious pedigree were dim. Possibly hobbled by dyslexia (a condition little understood and seldom treated during his childhood), Bush proved an uninspired student in high school. He did maintain a gentlemanly \"C+\" average at Yale and acquired a Masters of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School, but until he turned 40, he seemed to be floundering. He admittedly had a drinking problem in his youth, but a late marriage to Laura Welch helped stabilize him. His rebirth as a believing Christian (he is a Methodist whereas his parents were Episcopalian) in 1986 helped put him on the straight and narrow path that led him to the Presidency.\nBush has been discounted many times in his life and career for being wooden and unintelligent due to his fractured speaking style, but in fact, his academic performance was on par if not slightly better than that of his better-spoken, fellow Yalie\nJohn Kerry (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449902/?ls)\n. As Bush's test scores and subsequent achievements suggest an above average intelligence, it is appropriate to believe that he likely has benefited from other's underestimation of his gifts. This was apparent in the first televised debate with\nAl Gore (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330722/?ls)\nin 2000, when Bush held his own against the condescending vice president, and in doing so, triumphed in the eyes of the political handicappers.\nAfter W. turned his life around in the late 1980s, he began achieving success on his own, though that success inevitably was indebted to his social position and his father's business and political connections, particularly after he himself ascended to the Presidency after the expiration of\nRonald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ls)\n's second term. The first President Bush (Bush 41, as he is colloquially known) had great connections in the Middle East, particularly with the Saudi royal family and the powerful Bin Laden clan. Using his father's Saudi connections, Bush Jr. became a millionaire twice over through Middle Eastern oil projects. His most notable achievement in private life was in becoming president and chief operating partner of the Texas Rangers professional baseball team, which was financially invigorated by the building of a new stadium with taxpayers' funds. For a man whose greatest ambition was not the presidency but to be baseball commissioner, the \"job\" of Rangers owner suited him just fine, and his stint as the amiable owner of the team helped generate good publicity that wiped out his past image as a playboy. When he cashed out his ownership stake, Bush had a $14 million profit. More importantly, ownership of the Rangers positioned him financially and in the public eye for a successful run for the governorship of Texas, which proved to be his springboard to the presidency.\nUnder the quirky Texas constitution, the governor of Texas is primarily a ceremonial position, somewhat akin to that of the president in a Parliamentary system. The true political power in Texas lies with the lieutenant governor, who acts as a prime minister (or provincial premier in Canada) in that that he/she runs the legislature. In a life characterized by luck, the capricious Bush was luckier still in that he was told by the lieutenant governor, a Democrat, that he would make Bush a great governor if he would let him. Bush did and established an enviable reputation, one that crossed both party lines in Texas, where it would have been futile for the governor to act in a partisan fashion.\nWith his father's Eastern Establishment credentials that linked him to the \"Rockefeller Republicans\" (conservative on financial matters, liberal on social issues) and his mother's own noted social liberalism, Bush was seen as being a moderate with a difference. That difference was his connections to the powerful evangelical Christian wing of the Republican Party, due to his own rebirth as a believing Christian and his immersion in day-to-day Texas politics. In the Sun Belt, fundamentalists and evangelicals were considered ordinary, run-of-the-day folk, not the exotics that Washington and the Eastern Establishment looked at them as.\nWith a foot in both wings of the party, Bush was seen as a natural candidate for president after\nBob Dole (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230909/?ls)\n's dolorous 1996 candidacy. That he was a \"straight shooter\" with no scandal attached to him since his misbegotten youth (which he had confessed to and had put behind him) made him attractive to the Republicans, who had tried to terminate William Jefferson Clinton's presidency through impeachment due to his lies linked to his \"bimbo eruptions.\" Bush seemed like a \"Man for All Seasons\" that would be the GOP's best shot of unseating the Clintonistas as represented by Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election.\nWith the Republican Establishment firmly behind him as a kind of \"Great White Hope\" of the Grand Old Party, Bush managed to wrap up the nomination easily, after stumbling initially when confronted with the candidacy of the renegade Republican senator from Arizona,\nJohn McCain (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564587/?ls)\n. Although viewed by most Republicans as a RINO (Republican in name only), McCain dominated the early primaries in states that allowed cross over voting by attracting middle-of-the-road independents and conservative Democrats, but stumbled himself when the primary season headed South. He was badly defeated by Bush in South Carolina, a deeply conservative state that had voted for favorite son (and segregationist)\nStrom Thurmond (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2493440/?ls)\nin 1948, uber-conservative\nBarry Goldwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326400/?ls)\nin 1964, and segregationist\nGeorge Wallace (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908650/?ls)\nin 1968. McCain also was victimized by smear tactics, such as the whispering campaign started by Mississippi Senator\nTrent Lott (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1711619/?ls)\nthat claimed the renegade McCain had been mentally discombobulated by his seven years as a POW in Vietnam. The dirty tricks used against McCain by Bush campaign manager/major domo\nKarl Rove (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1311211/?ls)\nwould prove to be harbingers of the paranoid style of politics that would come to fruition during Bush's first term.\nMcCain, a maverick senator with the support of many moderate Republicans and Independents as well as a following among conservative Democrats, was not only smeared, but his attempts to get on the ballot in such states as New York were stymied until the federal courts stepped in. (In 2004, even though he endorsed Bush against Kerry, McCain found himself smeared again by elements connected with Karl Rove when he defended Kerry's war record and patriotism.) The Republican Establishment were determined to give the nomination to a true blue Republican who could win (the color red was not associated with the GOP until Election Night 2000, when it was used as the map color for the Party after a century wherein the Republicans were blue and the Democrats red). After his defeat of McCain in South Carolina, Bush had as easy a time wrapping up the nomination as if he had been an incumbent.\nAt the beginning of the fall campaign, what with the U.S. still enjoying the tail end of almost eight years of prosperity under President\nBill Clinton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001051/?ls)\n, his vice president, Al Gore, started out as a prohibitive favorite to win the presidency. Gore, whoever, turned out to be unable to shed his past reputation as an uninspiring campaigner, and failed to fire up the uncommitted. Bush, on the other hand, a relative unknown commodity who had enjoyed good press for the past decade as a baseball owner and governor, did not make many errors after appearing at Bob Jones University several weeks after it had banned interracial dating during the early Republican primaries (for which he apologized). He capitalized on the low expectations others had for him, and won respect - and votes - for going the distance without stumbling or embarrassing himself, while Gore had to live down the bimbo eruptions of his past running mate and his own faux pas, such as his claim to have invented the \"Information Superhighway\" (Internet). His stiff, \"Wooden Indian\" style came off as pompous on the campaign trail, giving Bush's persona a boost as it could have been portrayed as bumbling if he had been up against a natural born campaigner such as Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan.\nIn the game of politics as played in the US, Gore had everything to lose and Bush had everything to gain. Gore had to rise and exceed expectations while Bush merely had to live up to lowered expectations to rise above them and gain credence, and he did, beginning with the first debate. Going into the first debate, pundits expected the better-spoken Gore to eviscerate the syntactically challenged Bush (whose intelligence they disparaged), but it did not happen. Gore was haughty, and since Bush held his own, the governor of Texas was adjudged the winner. From there to the end of the campaign, Gore could never consolidate his early lead, which slipped away.\nOn election day, Bush and Gore were locked in a dead heat. In the closest election in a century, it all came down to a matter of 537 votes in Florida. Out of the nearly six million votes cast in the Sunshine State (5,861,785 total, with 36,742 won by third party candidates), Bush was certified as the winner, with a margin representing 0.0087%, less than nine one-thousandths of a percentage point.\nAfter a long drawn-out process involving recounts and court challenges, Bush took the oath of office on January 20, 2001 and won re-election in November 2004 to become the first son of a president to win two terms in office.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1682433/?ref_=ls_i_39)\n39. Barack Obama (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1682433/?ref_=ls_t_39)\nProducer\nActor\nMusic Department\nLeave the World Behind (2023) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12747748/?ref_=ls_knf_39)\nU.S. President Barack Hussein Obama II was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. His mother, Stanley\nAnn Dunham (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5023778/?ls)\n, was a white American from Wichita, Kansas. His father,\nBarack Obama Sr. (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3381194/?ls)\n, who was black, was from Alego, Kenya. They were both young college students at the University of Hawaii. When his father left for Harvard, his mother and Barack stayed behind, and his father ultimately returned alone to Kenya, where he worked as a government economist. Barack's mother remarried an Indonesian oil manager and moved to Jakarta when Barack was six. He later recounted Indonesia as simultaneously lush and a harrowing exposure to tropical poverty. He returned to Hawaii, where he was brought up largely by his grandparents. The family lived in a small apartment - his grandfather was a furniture salesman and an unsuccessful insurance agent and his grandmother worked in a bank - but Barack managed to get into Punahou School, Hawaii's top prep academy. His father wrote to him regularly but, though he traveled around the world on official business for Kenya, he visited only once, when Barack was ten. Obama attended Columbia University, but found New York's racial tension inescapable. He became a community organizer for a small Chicago church-based group for three years, helping poor South Side residents cope with a wave of plant closings. He then attended Harvard Law School, and in 1990 became the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review. He turned down a prestigious judicial clerkship, choosing instead to practice civil-rights law back in Chicago, representing victims of housing and employment discrimination and working on voting-rights legislation. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago Law School, and married Michelle Robinson (now\nMichelle Obama (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2349292/?ls)\n, a fellow attorney; their daughters are\nSasha Obama (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3127877/?ls)\nand\nMalia Obama (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3078497/?ls)\n. Eventually, he was elected to the Illinois state senate, where his district included both Hyde Park and some of the poorest ghettos on the South Side. In 2004, Obama was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, representing Illinois, and he gained national attention by giving a rousing and well-received keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. In 2008 he ran for President, and despite having only four years of national political experience, he won. In January 2009, he was sworn in as the 44th President of the United States, and the first African-American ever elected to that position. Obama was re-elected to a second term in November 2012 - and was sworn in in January 2013. His presidential term ended in January 2017\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874339/?ref_=ls_i_40)\n40. Donald Trump (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874339/?ref_=ls_t_40)\nProducer\nActor\nWriter\nThe Apprentice (2004–2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364782/?ref_=ls_knf_40)\nThe Trump family were German immigrants. Donald Trump's father became a multi-millionaire by building tenements in the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. After graduating from high school, Donald Trump studied economics at Fordham University and graduated from University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He gained his first professional experience in his father's company, and in 1974 he set up his own business in Manhattan. In 1975, Trump bought the old Commodore Hotel in New York and five years later he opened the Grand Hyatt Hotel New York. Donald quickly became known for his willingness to take risks. Trump quickly built up a considerable fortune through real estate in New York. In 1977 he married Ivana Trump. The marriage produced sons Donald Jr. (1977) and Eric (1984) and daughter Ivanka (1981). The divorce took place in 1992. In the 1980s, Trump divided his business areas into real estate, gaming, hotels and residential and commercial buildings, which were reunited under the umbrella of a holding company.\nTrump achieved international popularity in 1983 with the construction of the \"Trump Tower\" on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The building is 202 meters high and has 58 floors. Like John D. Rockefeller, Trump created a monument to his wealth in New York. In 1989, Donald Trump acquired the American airline Eastern Airlines, which he renamed as \"Trump Shuttle\" after the purchase. However, following poor operating figures, the company was sold again after three years. In 1990, Trump opened a gigantic hotel-casino called \"Trump - Taj Mahal\" in Atlantic City near New York. However, the construction resulted in unexpectedly high expenses. In total, commitments totaling around $3 billion were outstanding from other projects. This meant that Trump and his corporate empire were on the verge of ruin in the early 1990s. After negotiations with investors and banks, Donald Trump managed to reorganize his obligations and thus made a comeback as a major investor. He was married to Marla Maple from 1993 to 1999.\nIn 1998, the \"Trump - International Hotel and Tower\" was inaugurated at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. In addition to rental income from the Trump Tower and other exclusive commercial buildings, various casinos in New Jersey and Florida as well as large leisure centers were now also among the empire's sources of income. All facilities and business areas had Trump's name in their logo. Based on ever new gigantic construction projects, one could only speculate about his wealth. Trump owned around ten office and residential towers in excellent locations in New York alone. In 2001, Trump completed the \"Trump World Tower\" in New York. The extremely sophisticated residential and commercial high-rise in Manhattan Midtown is 262 meters high and has 72 floors. From 2003 to 2004 and 2004 to 2005, he appeared on the US television show \"The Apprentice\", in which he sought employees for his corporate empire.\nTwo years after the decision to redevelop \"Ground Zero,\" Trump came forward with a counterproposal in 2005. Instead of Daniel Libeskind's planned \"Freedom Tower,\" Trump wanted to resurrect the destroyed twin towers of the World Trade Center. The plans of the American star architect of Japanese origin Minoru Yamasaki served as a template. Trump married Melania Knauss, 28 years his junior, on January 22, 2005. Their son Barron William was born in 2006. In 2007 he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On June 16, 2015, Trump announced that he would run in the Republican primary as a candidate for the US presidential election in November 2016. In the first primary in the state of New Hampshire on February 9, 2016, Trump was able to clearly assert himself. He already had an absolute majority in May - thanks above all to his election slogan: \"Make America great again\". On July 19, 2016, Trump was officially elected as the presidential candidate at the Republican nomination convention in Cleveland. He formally accepted the election on July 21, 2016.\nOn November 8, 2016, Donald Trump won the US presidential election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. His inauguration in Washington D.C. was set for January 20, 2017 in accordance with the constitution. As President of the United States, Donald Trump pursued a rigorous government policy in all matters right from the start - according to the election motto: \"American first\", which earned him many votes. Not only was and is directly affected by the international trade community, but also US citizens with a migrant background and migrants who want to come to America.\nIn 2019, the American president recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, thereby single-handedly bringing about a momentous paradigm shift in international Middle East policy - which was undesirable by many politically involved. In the same year, 2019, he refused to sign the UN arms trade treaty ATT (Arms Trade Treaty), which has regulated international standards for the trade in conventional weapons since 2014. In addition, Trump's presidency was shaken by, among other things, the Russia affair and the Ukraine affair, which brought him impeachment proceedings, which he survived thanks to the Republican majority in the Senate. The US head of government is shaping a new style of government with his extensive use of the news medium \"Twitter\" by repeatedly disseminating important government announcements and personal opinions there. He continually describes his poor relationship with the public press with the catchphrase \"fake news\" that he has made popular, and which often catches up with his critics. Trump won the 2024 Republican nomination for president, initially campaigning against incumbent Joe Biden. However, when Biden dropped his campaign, Kamala Harris was selected to run in Biden's stead. Trump defeated Harris with both a majority and electoral win to become the 47th president. He will be only the second president to have a non-consecutive second term in office (after President Grover Cleveland).\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0081182/?ref_=ls_i_41)\n41.

William Jennings Bryan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0117021/?ref_=ls_t_1)\nSoundtrack\nProhibition (1915) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0005932/?ref_=ls_knf_1)\nWilliam Jennings Bryan is an American orator and politician from Nebraska. Beginning in 1896, he emerged as a dominant force in the Democratic Party, running three times as the party's nominee for President of the United States in the 1896, 1900, and 1908 elections. He served in the United States House of Representatives and as the United States Secretary of State under\nWoodrow Wilson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934306/?ls)\n.\nBorn and raised in Illinois, WilliamBryan moved to Nebraska in the 1880s. He won election to the House of Representatives in the 1890 elections, serving two terms before making an unsuccessful run for the Senate in 1894. The Democratic convention nominated Bryan for president, making Bryan the youngest major party presidential nominee in U.S. history. Subsequently, Bryan was also nominated for president by the left-wing Populist Party, and many Populists would eventually follow Bryan into the Democratic Party. In the intensely fought 1896 presidential election, Republican nominee\nWilliam McKinley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571838/?ls)\nemerged triumphant. Bryan gained fame as an orator, as he invented the national stumping tour when he reached an audience of 5 million people in 27 states in 1896.\nBryan retained control of the Democratic Party and won the presidential nomination again in 1900. In the election, McKinley again defeated Bryan, winning several Western states that Bryan had won in 1896. Bryan's influence in the party weakened after the 1900 election and the Democrats nominated the conservative\nAlton B. Parker (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3590112/?ls)\nin the 1904 presidential election. Bryan regained his stature in the party after Parker's resounding defeat by\nTheodore Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740485/?ls)\nand voters from both parties increasingly embraced the progressive reforms that had long been championed by Bryan. Bryan won his party's nomination in the 1908 presidential election, but he was defeated by\nWilliam Howard Taft (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1138324/?ls)\n. Along with\nHenry Clay (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10817172/?ls)\n, Bryan is one of the two individuals who never won a presidential election despite receiving electoral votes in three separate presidential elections.\nAfter the Democrats won the presidency in the 1912 election,\nWoodrow Wilson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934306/?ls)\nrewarded Bryan's support with the important cabinet position of Secretary of State. Bryan helped Wilson pass several progressive reforms through Congress. Bryan resigned from his post in 1915.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166479/?ref_=ls_i_2)\n2.

Cleveland was the first president in American history to serve two non-consecutive terms in office. He won the popular vote for three presidential elections-in 1884, 1888, and 1892-and was one of two Democrats (followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912) to be elected president during the era of Republican presidential domination dating from 1861 to 1933.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571838/?ref_=ls_i_3)\n3.

A member of the Republican Party, he was one of the most popular sitting U.S. presidents.

Calvin Coolidge (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177633/?ref_=ls_t_8)\nScreen Snapshots Series 9, No. 14 (1930) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765186/?ref_=ls_knf_8)\nThough three U.S. Presidents have died on the Fourth of July, John\nCalvin Coolidge was the first and only one to have been born on that\ndate, in 1874. He is also the only President to have had the oath of\noffice administered by his father, a justice of the peace, who swore\nhim in when the Coolidges received word of President\nWarren G. Harding (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1136403/?ls)\n's death. Coolidge's\nreputation is that of an unfeeling and lazy man, unaware of what was\ngoing on in the country and who dawdled while the United States drifted\ntoward the Great Depression. Yet history doesn't really support this\ncaricature of a man who actually was a highly intelligent and complex\nindividual.\nThough self-contained and terse, Coolidge was an extremely intelligent\nman and a fine scholar (his wedding gift to his wife, Grace Goodhue,\nwas his own translation of\nDante Alighieri (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0019604/?ls)\n's \"Inferno\". A week\nafter the wedding, Coolidge, ever the practical New Englander, also\npresented his wife with 52 pairs of his socks that needed mending).\nSome have argued that Coolidge was the best-prepared candidate ever to\nbecome President, having worked his way through a succession of\nelective political offices until he wound up as the Vice President\nunder Harding, attaining the presidency when Harding died in office in\nAugust of 1923. Coolidge was a laissez-faire proponent, believing, like\nJefferson, that the government governs best which governs least. In\nJuly of 1924 his son, Calvin Jr., died of blood poisoning. The younger\nCoolidge, like his mother, was an outgoing and gregarious boy, and his\ndeath affected his father deeply. Although some historians have\ncharacterized Coolidge's behavior in office as marked by laziness or\nindolence, it seems now that it was almost certainly a deep depression\nbrought about by the death of his son. Coolidge chose not to run in\n1928. Privately, his wife remarked to a friend that \"Daddy thinks there\nis going to be a Depression.\" On January 5, 1933, he died of heart\nfailure at his home in Northampton, Massachusetts.\nThough Coolidge was dismissed for years as a presidential lightweight,\nhis reputation has grown in recent years. President\nRonald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ls)\nretrieved Coolidge's\nportrait from storage and displayed it in the White House during his\ntenure in office, and a recent biography has provided a much more\nfavorable view of Coolidge and his presidency than had previously been\navailable.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393885/?ref_=ls_i_9)\n9. Herbert Hoover (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393885/?ref_=ls_t_9)\nAdditional Crew\nPublic Be Damned (1917) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0008471/?ref_=ls_knf_9)\nHerbert Hoover was born on August 10, 1874 in West Branch, Iowa. His\nfamily were devout Quakers. At age eight, Hoover was orphaned and was\nsent to live with relatives. They showed him little affection, but\ntaught him the importance of hard work and industry. In 1891, Hoover\nentered Stanford University's School of Engineering, graduating in\n1895. Four years later, he married his wife, Lou Henry and they had two\nsons, Herbert Jr. and Allan. From an early age, Hoover showed a\nprodigious talent for engineering and was hired by the engineering firm\nBewick and Moering, working in Australia and then in China. He was in\nChina when the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 broke out and he coordinated the\nbarricades of Americans trapped in China. At age forty, his engineering\ncareer was so successful that he was a millionaire. 1914 saw the\noutbreak of World War I in Europe. That was when he left his\nengineering career and entered public service. He organized a relief\neffort to feed starving Belgians, known as the Commission for the\nRelief of Belgium. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, President\nWoodrow Wilson asked Hoover to organize the Food Administration, which\nencouraged Americans to cut down on food consumption to help the war\neffort. After the end of World War I in 1918, Hoover organized a\nmassive relief effort to feed starving peoples in Europe, whose\ncountries had been devastated by the war. From 1921 to 1929, Herbert\nHoover served as Secretary of Commerce, under Presidents Harding and\nCoolidge, expanding the department and making it more active in working\nwith business and labor. In 1928, he was the Republican candidate for\nPresident and easily defeated his opponent, the Democratic Candidate,\nAlfred E. Smith. Herbert Hoover was sworn in as President on March 4,\n1929. Seven months after he entered office, the Stock Market crashed,\nending the \"Roaring Twenties\" and the economic boom of that decade and\nushered in the Great Depression. At first, Hoover was proactive in\nhandling this economic crisis, having meetings with business leaders on\nhow to weather the economic downturn, cutting taxes and increasing\nmoney for corporations and state governments. But none of this was\neffective in the teeth of the worst economic crisis in American\nhistory. He tried to calm the situation with statements like\n\"Prosperity is just around the corner,\" but they were not effective.\nHis dour demeanor and seemingly callous attitudes towards the millions\nof unemployed were what people saw in him, particularly when he refused\nto provide direct relief to the unemployed. Things came to a head in\nthe summer of 1932 when the Bonus Expeditionary Force (BEF), an army of\nWorld War I veterans, marched to Washington demanding immediate payment\nof a bonus promised to them in 1945. But the veterans wanted their\nmoney now. They camped out along the Anacostia River and lobbied for\ntheir bonus. The House of Representatives approved immediate payment,\nbut the Senate voted no. Hoover obtained $100,000 from Congress to buy\nthe veterans train tickets home. Many veterans accepted the offer, but\nmany stayed in Washington. At that point, the US army led by Gen.\nDouglas McArthur forcibly evicted the veterans from Washington, setting\ntheir camps on fire and forcing them out at gunpoint. In so doing,\nMcArthur disobeyed Presidential orders, but Hoover took full\nresponsibility for the eviction of the Bonus Marchers. In the 1932\nelection, Herbert Hoover was defeated in a landslide by Democrat\nFranklin D. Roosevelt. After he left office in 1933, Hoover returned to\nCalifornia and was an unstinting critic of FDR. After the death of his\nwife in 1944, Hoover moved to New York City where he lived his last\ntwenty years at the Waldorf Towers, remaining active in Republican\nParty politics. In 1946, President Harry Truman asked him to undertake\nyet another relief effort for the people of Europe; he and Truman\nbecame surprisingly good friends. In 1953, Hoover chaired a commission\nto increase efficiency in the Executive Branch of the Federal\nGovernment. He died on October 20, 1964 at age ninety.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0518992/?ref_=ls_i_10)\n10.

His father was 54 at the time of\nFDR's birth and already had a grown son, nicknamed \"Rosy\". Sarah was\nonly 27 when FDR was born. Growing up, FDR had a happy but sheltered\nchildhood. His family was very wealthy and FDR had a very privileged\nupbringing, with trips to Europe and private tutors. Sara Roosevelt was\na loving but domineering and overprotective mother. FDR was a devoted\nson, but found clever and subtle ways to get around his mother's\ndomination. At 14 he was sent to Groton, an exclusive prep school led\nby the Rev. Endicott Peabody. FDR did not enjoy his time at Groton,\noften being teased by the other kids for having a formal and stuffy\nmanner. Since he had a nephew who was older than him, kids at Groton\ncalled him \"Uncle Frank\". He graduated from Groton in 1900 and went to\nHarvard, where he edited the \"Crimson\" but failed to be accepted into\nthe Porcellian Social Club. He graduated Harvard in 1903. Soon after\nthat he fell madly in love with his sixth cousin,\nEleanor Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740482/?ls)\n. They married in\n1905, with President\nTheodore Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740485/?ls)\ngiving the bride\naway. However, from the start Franklin and Eleanor's marriage was not a\nhappy one. She was quiet and shy, whereas he was boisterous and\noutgoing. The fact that his mother moved into the house next door to\ntheirs, and ran things, did not help. Franklin and Eleanor had six\nchildren (one child died in infancy). In 1910 Franklin was elected to\nthe New York State Legislature from Duchess County. There he made a\nname for himself as a crusading reformer who favored the \"average guy\"\nover big business and championed for honest government. In 1913 he was\nappointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy and served under\nJosephus Daniels (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199993/?ls)\nand President\nWoodrow Wilson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934306/?ls)\n. In 1918 he began\na love affair with his wife's social secretary, Lucy Mercer. When\nEleanor discovered the affair, she was understandably devastated and\ntold Franklin she wanted a divorce. At the urging of his mother,\nFrankilin chose to save the marriage and promised Eleanor that he would\nnever have anything more to do with Lucy. The damage was done, however,\nand Franklin and Eleanor never again shared the intimacies of marriage,\nbecoming more like political partners. In 1921 FDR was stricken with\npolio and paralyzed. He permanently lost the use of his legs, but\nrefused to let that thwart his political ambitions. He spoke at the\n1924 Democratic Convention for the candidacy of\nAlfred E. Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0808341/?ls)\n, then the\nGovernor of New York, calling him the \"Happy Warrior\". In 1928 FDR was\nelected Governor of New York and was well placed when the stock market\ncrashed in 1929. As governor he took the lead in providing relief and\npublic works projects for the millions of unemployed in the state. His\nsuccess as New York's governor made him a strong candidate for the\nPresidency in 1932. He easily beat incumbent President\nHerbert Hoover (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393885/?ls)\n.\nWhen Franklin Roosevelt was sworn in as President on March 4, 1933,\nmore than 15 million Americans were unemployed. Millions more had been\nhard hit by the Depression and the banking system had collapsed. FDR\nwasted no time in launching a radical economic recovery program, known\nas the New Deal. He created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC), which made the federal government the guarantor of people's\nbank deposits - not the banks themselves - and allowed drought-stricken\nfarmers to refinance their mortgages, He created public works programs\nincluding the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Civilian\nConservation Corps (CCC)--thus making the government the employer of\nlast resort--as well as setting up the Social Security system,\ninstituting a minimum wage, outlawing child labor--a widespread\npractice at the time, especially in mines, factories and textile\nmills--and mandating a 40-hour work week with overtime pay. In\nresponding to the Depression, FDR forever changed the role of the\nfederal government in American life. He was easily reelected in 1936,\ndefeating Republican Alf Landon in a landslide. His second term as\npresident was less successful than his first, however. The Supreme\nCourt had ruled a number of New Deal measures unconstitutional. With an\nelectoral mandate in the bank, FDR proposed \"packing\" the Supreme Court\nwith justices of his political persuasion for every judge over the age\nof 70 that did not retire. However, Congress refused to pass the\nSupreme Court packing plan, and from that point on FDR was unable to\nget Congress to pass much of his legislation. Also, fascism was rising\nrapidly throughout Europe and Asia. Germany's\nAdolf Hitler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386944/?ls)\nand Italy's\nBenito Mussolini (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615907/?ls)\nhad both seized power\nand began to conquer other countries, such as Ethiopia, Austria and\nCzechoslovakia. FDR was unable to respond to the threats from Europe\nand Asia, however, because sentiment in the US was strongly\nisolationist and Congress had passed a series of neutrality laws that\ngave the President very little power to respond to international\naggression. World War II began in September 1939 when Hitler invaded\nPoland. Nine months later all of Western Europe had fallen to Hitler.\nThe UK and its Commonwealth and Empire was standing alone. FDR wanted to help Britain, but had\nto move carefully and skillfully. He negotiated a deal in which the US\ngave Britain 50 old destroyers in exchange for bases in the Western\nHemisphere. With World War II underway, FDR took the unprecedented move\nof seeking a third term as president. He won that term in November\n1940, defeating Republican\nWendell Willkie (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932521/?ls)\n. Safely re-elected, he\nproposed a radical new program for helping Britain, known as\nLend-Lease, in which Britain could buy armaments and other supplies\nfrom the US but not have to pay for them until after the war. FDR used\nthe analogy of borrowing a neighbor's hose to put out a house fire to\nsell Lend-Lease. It passed and America became the \"arsenal of\ndemocracy\" as it began to build armaments for Britain and then the Soviet Union,\nwhen Hitler invaded it in mid-1941. Roosevelt met Britain's Prime\nMinister,\nWinston Churchill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0161476/?ls)\n,\nfor the first time in August 1941 where they drew up the Atlantic\nCharter. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise attack\non Pearl Harbor, destroying much of America's Pacific fleet. The next\nday,FDR declared war on Japan, calling December 7 \"a date that will\nlive in infamy.\" America was in the war, and not only against Japan,\nbut also against Germany and Italy. Under FDR's leadership, America quickly\ntransformed itself from a decaying nation of idle factories,\nimpoverished families, abandoned farms and masses of hobos roaming the\nstreets to a nation turning out planes, tanks, guns, military vehicles\nand other armaments on a scale that quickly dwarfed the capability of\nNazi Germany to do the same. World War II also changed American life as\nblacks got better jobs in the war plants and women began working\noutside the home in unprecedented numbers. Helped by Eleanor, FDR used\nthe war as a vehicle for social progress, securing better treatment for\nminorities and women, higher wages and better benefits for workers and\na GI bill, which guaranteed a free college education for all American\nsoldiers who fought in the war. In so doing, he created the American\nmiddle class of today.\nAfter a series of military defeats, the US and its allies began to win\nthe war. Invasions of North Africa and Italy were launched and the US\nstarted retaking islands in the South Pacific it had lost to Japan at\nthe beginning of the war, starting with the Battle of Midway in 1942.\nFDR met with Churchill several times throughout the war and with Soviet\nleader\nJoseph Stalin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0821672/?ls)\nat Tehran in 1943 and\nat Yalta in 1945. The Allied invasion of France, known as D-Day, was\nlaunched on June 6, 1944. As the war ended, FDR pushed for his dream of\na United Nations and for reforms that would ensure that another World\nWar would never happen. The United Nations did come to pass, as well as\nnew global institutions such as the World Bank and IMF. Also, FDR\nadvocated for decolonization of Africa and Asia, leading to the\ncollapse of the old European empires.\nBecause of the war, FDR felt he had no right to leave the presidency\nwhile Americans under his command were still fighting. So he sought a\nfourth term in 1944. His opponent was the new governor of New York,\nThomas E. Dewey (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223150/?ls)\n, who ran a campaign of\ninnuendo, hinting that FDR was too ill to lead and that his government\nhad gone stale. FDR retaliated with a speech accusing the Republicans\nof attacking his dog, Fala. FDR won his fourth term in November 1944.\nIn January 1945 he journeyed to Yalta to confer with Churchill and\nStalin for the last time, to settle the postwar world and push for\nRussian participation in the United Nations. By this time FDR was\ngravely ill. After the Yalta Conference, he traveled to his resort at\nWarm Springs, Georgia, where he died suddenly of a massive stroke on\nApril 12, 1945. It was revealed that Lucy Mercer, his one-time lover,\nwas with him when he died and that she had secretly visited him in the\nWhite House a number of times during his last year.\nThere was an elaborate funeral for him, with a train procession from\nWarm Springs to Washington DC, then to Hyde Park, where he was buried.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908673/?ref_=ls_i_12)\n12.

Eisenhower was born on Tuesday, October 14, 1890, as Dwight David Eisenhower, in Denison, Texas. He was the third of seven sons born to David Jacob Eisenhower and Ida Elizabeth Stover. Both of his parents were of German descent. Eisenhower studied at the West Point Military Academy from 1911-1915. He served with the infantry, became the #3 leader of the tank corps, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel by the end of the First World War. From 1922-1924 he served in the Panama Canal Zone as executive officer to General, Fox Conner. From 1925-1926 he studied at the Command and General Staff College in Kansas, and from 1928-1933 he served as executive officer to Gen. George V. Moseley: Assistant Secretary of War, in Washington, DC.\nEisenhower was chief military aide to Gen.\nDouglas MacArthur (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0531274/?ls)\nfrom 1933-1935. He accompanied MacArthur to the Philippines in 1935, and served there as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government until 1939. Back in Washington, he held various staff positions and was promoted to Brigadier General in September 1941. Shortly after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, on Sunday, December 7th, 1941. Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff. There he gradually rose to Assistant Chief of Staff under the Chief of Staff, Gen.\nGeorge C. Marshall (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0550895/?ls)\n. Although Eisenhower had no experience in active military command, Marshall recognized his organizational and administrative strength. It was his association with Marshall that brought Eisenhower to London in June 1942 as Commanding General of the European Theater of Operations. He was also appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces of the North African Theater of Operations, which was renamed the Mediterranean Theater of Operations after the capitulation of the German army in Africa. In September of 1943 Eisenhower oversaw the Allied invasion of Sicily and then of Italy, which led to the immediate surrender of Italian forces in southern Italy. However, the German Winter Line fortifications in Italy, kept fighting even after the fall of Berlin.\nEisenhower was in charge of planning and carrying out the Allied landings in Normandy, France, and the invasion of Germany. The first part of his plan, named Operation Overlord, was the largest seaborne operation in history. Under this plan, 2.8 million Allied troops from 12 nations crossed the English Channel. Starting on Tuesday, June 6th, 1944, known as \"D-Day\", they landed on the beaches of Normandy, France. After extremely fierce heavy fighting, the Allies breached the fortifications and pushed back the defending German forces. Two months later they reached Paris.\nAdolf Hitler (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386944/?ls)\nhad ordered the German commander of Paris to destroy the city rather than let it fall into Allied hands, but that officer refused to carry out those orders and eventually surrendered the city to the Allies. After fighting that was not as fierce as was expected, the city of Paris was liberated on Friday, August 25th, 1944. Eisenhower was with French Gen.\nCharles de Gaulle (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0208540/?ls)\nat the Hotel de Ville, where they greeted the Allied forces and took part in the French victory parade. After liberating Belgium and the Netherlands, the Allied troops crossed into Germany. In 1945 US and Soviet armies linked up on the Elbe River, west of Berlin. Soon Eisenhower met with Russian Gen.\nGeorgi Zhukov (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955850/?ls)\nand the two made a trip to the Soviet Union; the first (and only) time Eisenhower did so. After the German surrender on Tuesday, May 8th, 1945, Eisenhower was made the Military Governor of the US Occupied Zone in Germany, based in Frankfurt. He ordered the detailed search, documentation, photographing and widespread dissemination of what went on in the Nazi death camps. By actions such as these, Eisenhower began the process of documenting the horrors of the Holocaust.\nAlthough he had never been in action himself, Eisenhower was respected as a brilliant military strategist and skilled political leader during the Second World War. He successfully dealt with conflicting demands from many sides, and managed to mollify such tough and determined personalities as\nWinston Churchill (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0161476/?ls)\n,\nJoseph Stalin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0821672/?ls)\n, Gen.\nBernard L. Montgomery (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0599728/?ls)\nand Gen.\nGeorge S. Patton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0666567/?ls)\n. From 1945 to 1948 Eisenhower was Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, and from 1950-1952 was Supreme Commander of all NATO forces.\nEisenhower won the 1952 US presidential elections, with\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\nas his Vice President, and brought the Republicans back to national power after 20 years. He was President from 1953-1960, becoming the first and only army general to serve as President in the 20th Century, formally becoming a civilian during his term in office. He ended the Korean War and offered peaceful co-existence with the Soviet Union after the death of Stalin in 1953. He authorized the 1953 Iranian coup d'etat and the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat. He invited\nNikita Khrushchev (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451979/?ls)\nto his first visit to the US in 1959, and hosted him at his farm at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where his children and grandchildren met the family of the Soviet leader. Shortly after that, however, the Soviets shot down an American U2 spy plane, captured the pilot and canceled Eisenhower's reciprocal visit to the Soviet Union. Relations between the two superpowers deteriorated very quickly, leading to an increasingly rapid nuclear arms race and a dangerous standoff in the Cold War.\nDomestically, Eisenhower began the modernization and integration of American roads into the interstate highway system, modeled after the autobahn, which he saw in Germany. In spite of some serious setbacks with US-Soviet relations, overall his presidency was a successful example of a non-partisan approach to politics.\nAfter his presidential term expired (US Presidents can only serve two terms), Eisenhower was again commissioned a five-star general in the army. He lived in retirement on his farm in Gettysburg, where he wrote his memoirs. He died on Friday, March 28th, 1969, at the Army Hospital in Washington, DC, and was laid to rest in Abilene, Kansas, at the Eisenhower Presidential Library.\nThe complete lifetime of\nDwight D. Eisenhower (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252032/?ls)\n, was from Tuesday, October 14th, 1890, to Friday, March 28th, 1969.

Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448132/?ls)\n. John was named\nafter his maternal grandfather, John \"HoneyFitz\" Fitzgerald, the mayor\nof Boston. John was very ill as a child and was given the last rites\nfive times, the first one being when he was a new-born. He was the\nsecond of four boys born to an Irish Catholic family with nine\nchildren: Joseph Jr., John,\nRobert F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448305/?ls)\n(called Bobby), and\nTed Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448356/?ls)\n(born Edward). Because\nRose made Joe and Jack (the name his family called him) wear matching\nclothes, they fought a lot for attention. When John was young, the\nfamily moved from Boston to New York. John went to Choate, a private\nschool. Most of the time, though, he was too sick to attend. In the\nlate 1930s, father Joe became the ambassador to England. He took sons\nJohn and Robert with him, as well as his wife and daughters Kathleen\nand\nRosemary Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1812993/?ls)\n. John went\nto Princeton, then Harvard, and for his senior thesis, he wrote a piece\nabout why England refused to get into the war until late. It was\npublished in 1940 and called \"Why England Slept\". His older brother Joe\nwas a pilot during the war, and was killed when the bombs his plane was\ncarrying exploded. Not long after that, John's sister Kathleen and her\nhusband died in a plane crash. In the early 1950s, John ran for\nCongress in Massachusetts and won.

They also had a stillborn daughter named Arabella and a son named Patrick\nBouvier, who died a few days after birth. In 1954, J.F.K. had to\nhave back surgery and in the hospital wrote his second book, \"Profiles\nin Courage\". His father always said that his son Joe was going to be\nPresident of the U.S.; when he died in World War II, though, that task\nwas passed on to John. He ran for president in 1960 against\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\nand narrowly won. His administration\nhad many conflicts, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis being\nkey examples. In November 1963, he and Jackie (his wife's nickname)\nwent on a trip to Texas.

When the persecution of the Jewish population in Germany intensified as a result of Adolf Hitler's rise to power in January 1933, he emigrated to the USA with his parents Paula Stern and Ludwig Kissinger in 1938. Kissinger attended high school in New York City. A little later he had to help support the family by working in a factory, which is why he switched to night school. In 1943 Kissinger received US citizenship. He then served in the Army until 1946, for which he was deployed in Germany. After the end of the war, Kissinger initially stayed in Europe, where he worked as a lecturer at the European Command Intelligence School in Oberammergau. In 1947, Kissinger returned to the United States to enroll at Harvard University. In 1952 he completed his master's degree there. Two years later he received his doctorate. phil.\nFrom 1952 to 1969, Kissinger headed the summer university at his university called the Harvard International Seminar. Here he got to know many foreign authorities with whom he would later have to deal as a foreign policy expert. In 1957 he was appointed lecturer and in 1962 professor at Harvard, where he held a full teaching position until 1965. Kissinger's entry into a decidedly political activity dates back to the early 1960s. Under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, he served as an advisor to the National Security Council until 1962 and as an advisor on disarmament issues until 1967. In 1965 he was appointed as an advisor to the State Department, which had to deal with the situation in Vietnam. In the following two years, Kissinger visited Vietnam several times. In 1969, President Richard Nixon elevated the veteran foreign policy expert to head the National Security Council. In this position, which he held until 1975, Kissinger opposed the policy of reconciliation and rapprochement that Kennedy and Johnson had previously initiated towards the Soviet Union.\nNevertheless, as one of his first foreign policy successes, he contributed to the conclusion of the SALT negotiations with the USSR, which culminated in the signing of the treaty by Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in Moscow. Kissinger also played a role in bringing about the agreement on the four-power status of West Berlin, which was reached on September 3, 1971 and contributed significantly to facilitating exchange and travel between both parts of the city. Kissinger also had a great influence on the secret diplomatic preparations that led to a rapprochement between the USA and the People's Republic of China under Nixon's presidency. When faced with the Vietnam problem, Kissinger sought to protect US interests with a policy of military strength, which brought him the most criticism. Nevertheless, he reached a ceasefire with Le Duc Tho in 1973, which earned both the Nobel Peace Prize and initiated the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. In 1973, Kissinger was promoted to Secretary of State under Nixon. After his resignation as a result of the Watergate affair, he was confirmed in this position for the entire term of office of the successor Gerald Rudolph Ford from 1974 to 1977.\nAs Foreign Minister, Kissinger tried to mediate between the Arab and Israeli sides, especially in the Middle East conflict, through intensive travel known as \"shuttle diplomacy\". This enabled him, among other things, In 1974 the conclusion of the troop disengagement agreement. After Kissinger left the ministerial office as a result of Ford's election defeat in 1977, he founded the consulting firm \"Kissinger Associates, Inc.\" in 1982, which produces analyzes for governments and commercial companies worldwide. In 1987 Kissinger was awarded the International Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen. After the upheavals of 1989/90 in the former Eastern Bloc states, Kissinger campaigned for the maintenance of the transatlantic alliance systems between the USA and Europe, for the rapid reunification of Germany and the continuation of European unification. He continued to speak out through numerous publications. In 2001 his treatise \"Does America Need a Foreign Policy?\" was published. In 2005 he received the Bavarian Order of Merit. In 2007, Kissinger was awarded the Baden-Württemberg Medal of Merit.\nHenry Kissinger died on November 29, 2023 in Kent.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0354067/?ref_=ls_i_25)\n25.

Gerald Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004934/?ref_=ls_t_26)\nActor\nAdditional Crew\nDynasty (1983– ) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081856/?ref_=ls_knf_26)\nGerald Rudolph Ford was the 38th President of the United States from August 1974 until January 1977.\nFord was born on July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Nebraska as Leslie Lynch King, Jr., being the son of Leslie Lynch King and Dorothy Ayer Gardner King. His parents separated two weeks after his birth and his mother took him to Grand Rapids, Michigan to live with her parents. On February 1, 1916, his mother Dorothy married Gerald R. Ford, a paint salesman. The Fords began calling their son Gerald R. Ford, Jr. but the name became legal only on December 3, 1935. Aged 13, Ford knew that Gerald Sr., was not his biological father, but it wasn't until 1930 he met his biological father Leslie King, who had made an unexpected stop in Grand Rapids.\nFord grew up in a family with three younger half-brothers, Thomas, Richard, and James. He attended South High School in Grand Rapids, where he already showed his athletics skills, being named to the honor society and the \"All-City\" and \"All-State\" football teams. As a scout he was ranked Eagle Scout in November 1927. He earned money by working in the family paint business and at a local restaurant.\nFord attended The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor from 1931 to 1935. He majored in economics and political science and graduated with a B.A. degree in June 1935. He played on the University's national championship football teams in 1932 and 1933 and was voted MVP of Wolverine in 1934. He also played in All-Star and benefit football games. He denied offers from two professional football teams, (Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers), but chose to become boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach at Yale hoping to attend law school there. Ford earned his law degree in 1941.\nAfter returning to Michigan and passing his bar exam, Ford set up a law partnership in Grand Rapids with Philip Buchen, a University of Michigan fraternity brother (who later served on Ford's White House staff as Counsel to the President).\nIn April 1942 Ford joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and became a physical fitness instructor at a flight school in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In the spring of 1943 he began service in the light aircraft carrier USS Monterey. Ford spent the remainder of the war ashore and was discharged as a lieutenant commander in February 1946. He returned to Grand Rapids to become a partner in the locally prestigious law firm of Butterfield, Keeney, and Amberg.\nHis first political experience was in the summer of 1940 when he was working in the presidential campaign of Wendell Willkie. Six years later he decided to challenge Bartel Jonkman for the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1948 election. Ford won the nomination and after that was elected to Congress on November 2, 1948, receiving 61% of the vote.\nOn October 15 1948, the height of the campaign, Ford married Elizabeth ('Betty') Anne Bloomer Warren, a department store fashion consultant. Betty was born on April 8, 1918 in Chicago, Illinois, but grew up in Grand Rapids. They subsequently had four children: Michael Gerald (March 14, 1950), John Gardner (March 16, 1952), Steven Meigs (May 19, 1956) and Susan Elizabeth (July 6, 1957).\nFord served in the House of Representatives from January 3, 1949 to December 6, 1973. He was re-elected twelve times, winning each time with more than 60% of the vote. As his ambition was to become Speaker of the House already in the early 1950s, he denied offers to run for both the Senate and the Michigan governorship in these years. In 1961 he became chairman of the House Republican Conference. In 1963 President Johnson appointed Ford to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was the last living member of the Warren Commission.\nIn 1965 Ford was chosen as the House minority leader, a post he held until 1973. As minority leader Ford made more than 200 speeches a year all across the country, which made him nationally known. He was not only a close friend of Richard Nixon for many years, but also a loyal supporter in both the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections. As in 1960, Ford was again considered as a vice presidential candidate in 1968. Because the Republicans did not attain a majority in the House, Ford was unable to reach his ultimate political goal, Speaker of the House. Instead, he became President of the Senate.\nLate in 1973 Spiro Agnew pleaded no contest to a charge of income tax evasion and resigned as Vice President. President Nixon was empowered by the 25th Amendment to appoint a new vice president and chose Ford. He was sworn in on December 6, 1973.\nOn August 9, 1974, Nixon became the first president in U.S. history to resign from the office under the threat of impeachment in the Watergate scandal. The same day Gerald R. Ford took the oath of office as 38th President of the United States on August 9, 1974. Also in August 1974, Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller for vice president, which nomination was confirmed by Congress on December 19, 1974.\nOne month after taking office President Ford faced one of the toughest decisions in his career. He decided to grant Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon for all offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in. The public opinion was mostly negative about the pardon and there was even suspicion Ford and Nixon had made a deal to grant a pardon if Nixon would resign. Although this happened on September 8, 1974, it might have cost the re-election of Ford two years later.\nOn November 24, 1974, in the conference hall of the Okeansky Sanitarium, Vladivostok, USSR, President Ford and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev signed the SALT-treaty, following talks on the limitation of strategic offensive arms.\nIn March 1975, during the final days of the Vietnam War, Ford ordered the airlift of about 237,000 Vietnamese refugees to the United States. Two months later, on May 14, 1975, Ford ordered U.S. forces to retake the S.S. Mayaguez after its seizure by Cambodia, an action Ford characterized as an \"act of piracy.\" The operation saved the ship's 39-member crew, but sadly 41 Americans were killed and 50 more wounded during the preparation and execution of the rescue.\nPresident Ford was twice the target of assassination attempts. Both took place in on two separate trips to California in September 1975 and both were 'performed' by women. On September 5, 1975 he survived an assassination attempt in Sacramento, California, by Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, a member of a cult once led by convicted mass murderer Charles Manson. On September 22, 1975, in San Francisco, California, Sara Jane Moore fired a shot at the president, but a bystander diverted the shot.\nDespite his former athletics skills, Gerald Ford tumbled several times during his presidency. No cause was ever communicated. At the Republican National Convention in August 1976, Ford fought off a serious challenge from Californian Governor Ronald Reagan to be nominated as his party's presidential candidate. He chose Senator Robert Dole of Kansas as his running mate.\nAlthough he succeeded in closing in on Democrat Jimmy Carter's large lead in the polls, President Ford finally lost one of the closest elections in history in November 1976. After leaving office, Gerald and Betty Ford returned to private life and moved to California where they built a new house in Rancho Mirage, which became his last residence.\nPresident Ford continued to actively participate in the political process and to speak out on important political issues. He lectured at hundreds of colleges and universities. In 1981, the Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, were dedicated.\nPresident Ford was the recipient of numerous awards and honors by many civic organizations, like the recipient of many honorary Doctor of Law degrees from various public and private colleges and universities.\nIn August 1999, President Bill Clinton presented Ford with the nation's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom. Two months later, in\nOctober 1999, Senate and House leaders presented Ford and his wife, Betty, with the Congressional Gold Medal. Together with former President Carter, he served as honorary Co-Chair of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001. In May 2001 he was presented with the Profiles in Courage award for his controversial decision to pardon former President Nixon.\nIn August 2000 Ford suffered a mild stroke while attending the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On May 16, 2003 following fluctuations in blood pressure and hot weather, Ford suffered dizzy spells on the golf course and taken to hospital. He was released the next day.\nAlthough President Ford cut back on his travel and public appearances in recent years, he attended funeral services for President Ronald Reagan at Washington's National Cathedral, sitting with former Presidents Clinton, Bush and Carter, and their wives in June 2004.\nIn August 2006, he was discharged from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, after doctors tried to reduce or eliminate blockages in his coronary arteries. They also implanted a pacemaker to improve his heart performance. In the fall of 2006 Ford spent several days at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage for medical tests. He was released on October 16.\nOn November 12, 2006, Ford officially became the longest-lived president, surpassing Ronald Reagan. Ford would extend the record by 45 days.\nOn December 26, 2006 at 6:45 p.m., President Ford died in his house in Rancho Mirage, California. He was aged 93 years and 165 days old, making him the longest-lived United States President. No cause of death was communicated. A state funeral and memorial services were held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on January 2, 2007. President Ford was buried at his presidential museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nPresident Gerald Ford was survived by his wife Betty, after more than 58 years of marriage, and by their four children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. He was also survived by his brother, Richard, of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230909/?ref_=ls_i_27)\n27.

Ronald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ref_=ls_t_31)\nActor\nProduction Manager\nAdditional Crew\nKings Row (1942) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034946/?ref_=ls_knf_31)\nRonald Reagan had quite a prolific career, having catapulted from a Warner Bros. contract player and television star, into serving as president of the Screen Actors Guild, the governorship of California (1967-1975), and lastly, two terms as President of the United States (1981-1989).\nRonald Wilson Reagan was born in Tampico, Illinois, to Nelle Clyde (Wilson) and John Edward \"Jack\" Reagan, who was a salesman and storyteller. His father was of Irish descent, and his mother was of half Scottish and half English ancestry.\nA successful actor beginning in the 1930s, the young Reagan was a staunch admirer of President\nFranklin D. Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740483/?ls)\n(even after he evolved into a Republican), and was a Democrat in the 1940s, a self-described 'hemophiliac' liberal. He was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1947 and served five years during the most tumultuous times to ever hit Hollywood. A committed anti-communist, Reagan not only fought more-militantly activist movie industry unions that he and others felt had been infiltrated by communists, but had to deal with the investigation into Hollywood's politics launched by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947, an inquisition that lasted through the 1950s. The House Un-American Activities Committee investigations of Hollywood (which led to the jailing of the \"Hollywood Ten\" in the late '40s) sowed the seeds of the McCarthyism that racked Hollywood and America in the 1950s.\nIn 1950, U.S. Representative\nHelen Gahagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0301099/?ls)\nDouglas (D-CA), the wife of \"Dutch\" Reagan's friend\nMelvyn Douglas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002048/?ls)\n, ran as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate and was opposed by the Republican nominee, the Red-bating Congressman from Whittier,\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\n. While Nixon did not go so far as to accuse Gahagan Douglas of being a communist herself, he did charge her with being soft on communism due to her opposition to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Nixon tarred her as a \"fellow traveler\" of communists, a \"pinko\" who was \"pink right down to her underwear.\" Gahagan Douglas was defeated by the man she was the first to call \"Tricky Dicky\" because of his unethical behavior and dirty campaign tactics. Reagan was on the Douglases' side during that campaign.\nThe Douglases, like Reagan and such other prominent actors as\nHumphrey Bogart (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000007/?ls)\nand\nEdward G. Robinson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000064/?ls)\n, were liberal Democrats, supporters of the late\nFranklin D. Roosevelt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740483/?ls)\nand his New Deal, a legacy that increasingly was under attack by the right after World War II. They were NOT fellow-travelers; Melvyn Douglas had actually been an active anti-communist and was someone the communists despised. Melvyn Douglas, Robinson and\nHenry Fonda (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000020/?ls)\n- a registered Republican! - wound up \"gray-listed.\" (They weren't explicitly black-listed, they just weren't offered any work.) Reagan, who it was later revealed had been an F.B.I. informant while a union leader (turning in suspected communists), was never hurt that way, as he made S.A.G. an accomplice of the black-listing.\nReagan's career sagged after the late 1940s, and he started appearing in B-movies after he left Warner Bros. to go free-lance. However, he had a eminence grise par excellence in\nLew Wasserman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1348282/?ls)\n, his agent and the head of the Music Corp. of America. Wasserman, later called \"The Pope of Hollywood,\" was the genius who figured out that an actor could make a killing via a tax windfall by turning himself into a corporation. The corporation, which would employ the actor, would own part of a motion picture the actor appeared in, and all monies would accrue to the corporation, which was taxed at a much lower rate than was personal income. Wasserman pioneered this tax avoidance scheme with his client\nJames Stewart (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000071/?ls)\n, beginning with the\nAnthony Mann (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0542649/?ls)\nwestern\nWinchester '73 (1950) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043137/?ls)\n(1950). It made Stewart enormously rich as he became a top box office draw in the 1950s after the success of \"Winchester 73\" and several more Mann-directed westerns, all of which he had an ownership stake in.\nIronically, Reagan became a poor-man's James Stewart in the early 1950s, appearing in westerns, but they were mostly B-pictures. He did not have the acting chops of the great Stewart, but he did have his agent. Wasserman at M.C.A. was one of the pioneers of television syndication, and this was to benefit Reagan enormously. M.C.A. was the only talent agency that was also allowed to be a producer through an exemption to union rules granted by S.A.G. when Reagan was the union president, and it used the exemption to acquire Universal International Pictures. Talent agents were not permitted to be producers as there was an inherent conflict of interest between the two professions, one of which was committed to acquiring talent at the lowest possible cost and the other whose focus was to get the best possible price for their client. When a talent agent was also a producer, like M.C.A. was, it had a habit of steering its clients to its own productions, where they were employed but at a lower price than their potential free market value. It was a system that made M.C.A. and Lew Wasserman, enormously wealthy.\nThe ownership of Universal and its entry into the production of television shows that were syndicated to network made M.C.A. the most successful organization in Hollywood of its time, a real cash cow as television overtook the movies as the #1 business of the entertainment industry. Wasserman repaid Ronald Reagan's largess by structuring a deal by which he hosted and owned part of\nGeneral Electric Theater (1953) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045395/?ls)\n, a western omnibus showcase that ran from 1954 to 1961. It made Reagan very comfortable financially, though it did not make him rich. That came later.\nIn 1960, with the election of the Democratic President\nJohn F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448123/?ls)\n, the black and gray lists went into eclipse. J.F.K. appointed Helen Gahagan Douglas Treasurer of the United States. About this time, as the civil rights movement became stronger and found more support among Democrats and the Kennedy administration, Reagan - fresh from a second stint as S.A.G. president in 1959 - was in the process of undergoing a personal and political metamorphosis into a right-wing Republican, a process that culminated with his endorsing\nBarry Goldwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326400/?ls)\nfor the Republican presidential nomination in 1964. (He narrated a Goldwater campaign film played at the G.O.P. Convention in San Francisco.) Reagan's evolution into a right-wing Republican sundered his friendship with the Douglases. (After Reagan was elected President of the United States in 1980, Melvyn Douglas said of his former friend that Reagan turned to the right after he had begun to believe the pro-business speeches he delivered for General Electric when he was the host of the \"G.E. Theater.\")\nIn 1959, while Reagan was back as a second go-round as S.A.G. president, M.C.A.'s exemption from S.A.G. regulations that forbade a talent agency from being a producer was renewed. However, in 1962, the U.S. Justice Department under Attorney General\nRobert F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448305/?ls)\nsuccessfully forced M.C.A. - known as \"The Octopus\" in Hollywood for its monopolistic tendencies - to divest itself of its talent agency.\nWhen Reagan was tipped by the California Republican Party to be its standard-bearer in the 1965 gubernatorial election against Democratic Governor Pat Brown, Lew Wasserman went back in action. Politics makes strange bedfellows, and though Wasserman was a liberal Democrat, having an old friend like Reagan who had shown his loyalty as S.A.G. president in the state house was good for business. Wasserman and his partner, M.C.A. Chairman Jules Styne (a Republican), helped ensure that Reagan would be financially secure for the rest of his life so that he could enter politics. (At the time, he was the host of \"Death Valley Days\" on TV.)\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Universal sold Reagan a nice piece of land of many acres north of Santa Barbara that had been used for location shooting. The Reagans sold most of the ranch, then converted the rest of it, about 200 acres, into a magnificent estate overlooking the valley and the Pacific Ocean. The Rancho del Cielo became President Reagan's much needed counterpoint to the buzz of Washington, D.C. There, in a setting both rugged and serene, the Reagans could spend time alone or receive political leaders such as the Soviet President\nMikhail Gorbachev (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329784/?ls)\n, Margaret Thatcher, and others.\nReagan was known to the world for his one-liners, the most famous of them was addressed to\nMikhail Gorbachev (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329784/?ls)\nin 1987. \"Mister Gorbachev, tear down this wall\" said Reagan standing in front of the Berlin Wall. That call made an impact on the course of human history.\nRonald Reagan played many roles in his life's seven acts: radio announcer, movie star, union boss, television actor-cum-host, governor, right-wing critic of big government and President of the United States.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0118059/?ref_=ls_i_32)\n32.

Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124133/?ls)\n, the 43rd president of the U.S., who is known as \"Bush 43\"), was born on June 12, 1924 in Milton, Massachusetts, a suburb south of Boston. His parents were Dorothy (Walker) and\nPrescott Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1778210/?ls)\n, who was then the president of sales for the Stedman Products Co. of South Braintree, Massachusetts. In 1925, Prescott joined the United States Rubber Co. (New York, NY) as their foreign division manager, necessitating a move to Greenwich, Connecticut.\nPrescott Bush (Yale 1917) made his fortune and name as an investment banker on Wall St., eventually becoming a partner of the white shoe brokerage Brown Bros. Harriman. He was a member of the Yale Corp., the principal governing body of Yale University, from 1944 to 1956 and was on the board of directors of the Columbia Broadcasting System (C.B.S.), after having been introduced to C.B.S. Chairman\nWilliam Paley (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1013200/?ls)\nin 1932 by his friend and business partner\nAverell Harriman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364207/?ls)\n, a major Democratic party power-broker.\nGeorge Bush was educated at the exclusive Greenwich Country Day School in Greenwich, Connecticut before moving on to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he matriculated from 1936 to 1942. At Phillips Andover, he captained the baseball and soccer teams and was a member of an exclusive fraternity called the A.U.V, or \"Auctoritas, Unitas, Veritas\", Latin for \"Authority, Unity, Truth\". Like his father before him, Bush was on schedule to attend Yale College and would have in the fall of 1942, but for the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor by the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941 that necessitated the entry of the United States into World War II.\nUpon his graduation from Phillips Andover, George Bush enlisted in the U.S. Navy on June 12, 1942, his 18th birthday, with the intent on becoming an aviator. After completing the 10-month naval aviation course, he was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve three days before his nineteenth birthday, which made him the youngest naval aviator ever at the time.\nGeorge Bush married the former Barbara Pierce on January 6, 1945, and after he was demobilized, they moved to New Haven, Connecticut so that he could attend Yale, where he proved a fine student and captained the baseball team, which made it to the first College World Series. They had their first of six children, future President George Walker Bush, two days after the Fourth of July, 1946. In his senior year, George Bush was tapped for the exclusive secret society Skull & Bones, as had been his father (and as his son would be).\nUsing his father's connections and $2 million in seed money from his relatives (approximately $17 million in 2006 terms), George Bush prospered in the oil industry after graduating from Yale in 1949. Through his father's business and social relationship with a fellow Skull & Bones member, George Bush secured a position with Dresser Industries, on whose board of directors Prescott had served for 22 years.\nAs the son of a moderate Republican senator, it was natural that George Bush would stand for office. At the time, the \"Solid South\" was solidly Democratic, with the Republican Party of Civil War winner (and Civil Rights champion) Abraham Lincoln anathema below the Mason-Dixon line.Good Republican candidates were hard to come by (though John Tower later proved that a Republican could win in the Deep South when he took a Senate seat in 1966). One year after his father left the Seante, his son George stood won the Republican nomination to oppose Democratic Senator Ralph Yarborough, an ally of President 'Lyndon Johnson (I)' (QB), who was on his way to defeating Republican Presidential nominee\nBarry Goldwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326400/?ls)\nin an electoral landslide in 1964. Riding the coat-tails of favorite son Johnson, Yarborough handily won reelection, keeping George Bush in the private sector for two more years.\nBush stood for a House seat in 1966 and won, then won reelection in 1968. In Congress, he established a reputation as a liberal Republican and was known as a supporter of contraception services (his father, Prescott, had been a mainstay of Planned Parenthood). At the request of President\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\n, Bush gave up his seat voluntarily in 1970 to seek the Senate seat of Democratic Senator Ralph Yarborough, who was a fierce Nixon critic. It was felt that Yaborough's liberalism made him vulnerable to a challenge from the right, and it did; however, it was the right-wing of the Democratic Party. Lloyd Bentsen won the Democratic nomination and, endorsed by Yarborough, beat Bush handily in the November general election. (Ironically, Bentsen would one day be the running mate of Bush's 1988 rival for the presidency,\nMichael Dukakis (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0241144/?ls)\n.) One of the reason for Bush's defeat was that with Yarborough out of the race, Nixon's support for Bush's campaign was only half-hearted.\nAs a payback to Bush, Nixon appointed him Ambassador to the United Nations, and he later served Nixon as the Chairman of the Republican National Committee during the Watergate crisis. Nixon's successor in the Oval Office,\nGerald Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004934/?ls)\n, briefly considered appointing Bush as his replacement as vice president before going with liberal Republican stalwart\nNelson Rockefeller (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734224/?ls)\n, the four-term governor of the State of New York, but Ford eventually appointed Bush as the first American plenipotentiary to Communist China, then later director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\nAfter losing the 1980 Republican nomination to\nRonald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ls)\n, Bush was chosen as Reagan's running mate and elected Vice President of the United States in Reagan's victory over incumbent President\nJimmy Carter (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141699/?ls)\nin November. In 1988, Bush as vice president was Reagan's heir apparent, and he won the Republican nomination handily, though personally he was not very popular. Bush was perceived as \"weak\" due to his social liberalism, which included support for abortion rights and contraception. As a \"Rockefeller Republican\" (that is, an Eastern Establishment pro-business Republican who is moderate or liberal on social issues), Bush, unlike Reagan, was out-of-step in an increasingly conservative party dominated by voters from the South and West. The well-educated, thoughtful Bush, according to Reagan biographer Edmund Morris, was a genuinely nice and gracious person, and more importantly: sincere. However, he was perceived as not standing for anything, at least not in the stark black & white terms that had inspired the conservative if not reactionary Republican Party faithful during the two terms of the \"Great Communicator\".\nAs president, Bush saw the collapse of the Soviet Union, and he soared to unprecedented levels of public approval after his firm handling of\nSaddam Hussein (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0404010/?ls)\n's invasion of Kuwait pushed the Iraqi army out of the invaded kingdom with a minimum amount of U.S. casualties. However, his popularity plummeted by the time the campaign rolled around in 1992 due to his seeming inability to cope with a recession caused by economic dislocations linked to the end of the Cold War.\nAfter the presidency, George Bush prospered financially as a corporate speaker, reportedly making as much as $10 million from the Reverend\nSun Myung Moon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0600671/?ls)\n. Bush's business ventures through the Carlyle Group, a private equity fund with close ties to the government of Saudi Arabia, have proved very remunerative. Most importantly, he achieved a sort of personal vindication when his son, George Walker Bush, defeated Clinton's vice president, Al Gore, and was elected the 43rd President of the United States.\nIn the twilight of his years, comfortably retired from the political wars, Bush teamed with fellow ex-President Bill Clinton for a uniquely close relationship in which the two jointly led campaigns to help the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 devastation of the Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina via private sector fund-raising.\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush died on November 30, 2018, in Houston, Texas. He joined his wife Barbara, who had passed in April of that year.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1635822/?ref_=ls_i_34)\n34.

Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448123/?ls)\nand his 1988\nPresidential opponent Bush). Dukakis' father was a Harvard-educated\nphysician and his mother was a Massachusetts schoolteacher. She worked\nto eliminate first her native Greek accent and then her New England\naccent to remove imperfections from her speech pattern that might\nhinder her teaching ability. In a time and place where non-Anglo-Saxon\nethnicity was looked down upon (even that of the Irish Americans who\nemigrated to the U.S. with the ability to speak English and a knowledge\nof Anglo-Saxon politics) and even proved a hindrance to social\nmobility, the Dukakis family was committed to assimilation. Part of the\nbad rap against Dukakis that would cost him his first reelection\ncampaign as governor and his bid for the White House was that he was\ntoo stiff and formal; yet, being brought up in an era and place in\nwhich overt displays of emotion were looked down upon upon by the\nruling class of Boston Brahmins as too \"ethnic\" (as well as betraying\nlower-caste origins), one can understand Dukakis' coolness and reserve\nas being an attempt not to be stereotyped by his social \"betters\". (His\ncontemporary, three-term New York governor\nMario Cuomo (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0192521/?ls)\n, said that when he entered law\npractice in the early 1950s, he was told to ditch his Italian name and\nrename himself something along the lines of \"Mike COnnors\". He, of\ncourse, refused, though that type of ethnic cleansing was considered\nnormal among upwardly mobile and socially ambitious \"urban ethnics\" of\nthe time.)\nThe class system in Boston was so strict before being shattered by\nJohn F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448123/?ls)\n's presidency that JFJ's\nfather,\nJoseph P. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448132/?ls)\n, felt the\nneed to relocate his family to New York City in the 1930s so that they\nwould no grow up amidst anti-Irish prejudice. Despite the fact that he\nwas one of the richest men in the country and his wife was the daughter\nof a Boston mayor, an Irish Catholic was beyond the pale, socially, to\nthe Boston Brahmins, the brethren of the Cabot and Lodge families that\ndominated the self-proclaimed \"Hub\" of the universe. (A local ditty\nwent about Boston hailed the Hub as \"...the land of the bean and the\ncod,/Where the Lodges speak only to the Cabots,/And the Cabots speak\nonly to God.)\nAfter graduating from Swarthmore College in 1955, Dukakis served as an\nenlisted intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army. After completing his\nmilitary service, he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1960. After\nserving in the General Court (Massachusetts legislature), Dukakis was\nelected governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1974,\ndefeating the incumbent Republican Francis W. Sargent. The commonwealth\nwas undergoing a fiscal crisis and the Republican Party was very\nunpopular in the commonwealth, the only state that had been won in the\nelectoral college by 1972 Presidential candidate\nGeorge McGovern (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0569566/?ls)\ntwo years before.\nDukakis' victory was the result, partially, of his taking a pledge not\nto increase the state's sales tax to balance the state budget, but he\nreneged on the promise soon after taking office. During the great\nBlizzard of 1978, which shut down Boston and a good deal of the\nCommonwealth, \"The Duke\" went into local TV studios in a sweater to\nannounce emergency bulletins. The coldness of his public persona in the\nmidst of the crisis was likened to that of the weather itself, and hurt\nhis popularity. Combined with a nation-wide and local backlash against\nthe high property tax rates, and his reneging on his promise to not\nraise the sales tax, he lost to Edward J. King in the Democratic\nprimary, as King capitalized on the issue of taxes. Following\nCalifornia's lead, the voters of the Commonwealth voted for Proposition\n2 and 1/2 that limited property tax rates to 2 1/2% of the property\nvaluation.\nDukakis defeated King in in the Democratic primary in 1982, and easily\ndefeated his Republican opponent to be reelected governor. (Fellow\nfuture Democratic Presidential nominee\nJohn Kerry (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449902/?ls)\nwas elected Lieutenant\nGovernor on the same ballot with Dukakis, serving in the Dukakis\nadministration from 1983 to 1985, when he was took\nPaul Tsongas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875149/?ls)\n's Senate seat.) The second\nterm and the first years of Dukakis' third term as governor were very\nsuccessful (he won re-election in 1986 with over 60% of the vote),\nduring which time he presided over a booming economy fueled by the\nhigh-technology industry, second at the time only to that of\nCalifornia. A reform-minded technocrat, Dukakis was given credit for\nthe \"Massachusetts Miracle\" (part of the credit of which should be\nattributed to Masssachusetts Congressman Tip O'Neil, who had taken over\nJFK's old congressional district, who as the powerful Democratic\nSpeaker of the House helped direct billions in defense spending to the\nCommonwealth).\nThe National Governors Association voted Dukakis the most effective\ngovernor in 1986, positioning Dukakis for a bid for the presidency.\nBasing his candidacy as the architect of the \"Massachusetts Miracle\",\nDukakis overcame the other contenders for the Democratic Party\npresidential nomination (a group dubbed the \"Seven Dwarfs\" by the media\nfor their collective lack of stature or prominence on the national\nstage; Dukakis' own personal lack of stature). The success\nof the Dukakis' campaign was largely attributed to campaign manager\nJohn Sasso, who had originally worked for rival candidate Joseph Biden.\n(Having also managed the campaigns of\nAl Gore (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330722/?ls)\nand\nJohn Kerry (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449902/?ls)\n, Sasso is now 0-3 in\npresidential election contests.)\nDukakis came out of the Democratic convention with an overwhelming lead\nover Ronald Reagan's heir-apparent, Vice President\nGeorge Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124132/?ls)\n, the Republican nominee, but\nwould not or could not handle the dirty campaign tactics that were the\nstock-in-trade of all the Vice President's men, including\nLee Atwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1403979/?ls)\n. While the Dukakis camp expected\nan attack on their candidate as a traditional liberal, they did not\nseem to be able to cope with the McCarthyite vitriol from the Bush\ncamp, which sought to make the \"L\" word the equivalent of what\ncommunism had been in the early 1950s. Harking back to McCarthy, Bush\nhad accused Dukakis during one of their televised debates as being a\n\"card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union,\" replacing\n\"communist\" with the ACLU (a variation of the \"L\"-word) and recycling\nan old charge from the '50s against liberals and \"fellow travelers\".\nUnlike future Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Clinton (who had\ndelivered the key-note address at the 19988 Democratic convention), who\nwhen confronted with Bush's dirty tactics, such as pillorying his\nwife Hillary, shot back that \"I'm not running for First Lady\", thus\ntouching on Bush's Achilles heel, the \"Wimp Factor\" -- Dukakis would\nnot fight back. He either was constitutionally unable to fight back, or\nthought it beneath his dignity to answer the smears and accusations.\nIssues the Bush campaign chose to highlight were his veto of\nlegislation requiring public school teachers to lead pupils in the\nPledge of Allegiance and his opposition to capital punishment.\nAs it had during the Big Blizzard, The Duke's stoical personality as\nprojected to the voting public was interpreted as a lack of passion\n(which ran against the traditional stereotype of the Greek-American\nbeing fiery if not hot headed, an image that Dukakis, like his mother\nearlier, chose to expunge from his being). His opponents, touching on\nhis reputation as a technocrat and superb administrator, referred to\nhim as \"Zorba the Clerk.\" Nevertheless, Dukakis widely was perceived to\nhave performed well in the first presidential debate with Bush, and his\ncandidacy was buoyed by his running mate, Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen,\nwho was not afraid to take off the gloves. However, in the second\ndebate, the runner stumbled; Dukakis had been suffering from the flu.\nStill, his performance was poor and played to his reputation as being\ncold, particularly his response to moderator\nBernard Shaw (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0789615/?ls)\n's question, \"Governor, if\nKitty Dukakis [his wife] were raped and murdered, would you favor an\nirrevocable death penalty for the killer?\"\nProjecting himself as a man of reason, Dukakis replied with no visible\nemotion, \"No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death\npenalty during all of my life,\" and then explained his stance. Many\nobservers felt Dukakis' answer lacked the normal emotions one would\nexpect of a person discussing a loved one's rape and death. Many -\nincluding the candidate himself - believe that this, in part, cost\nDukakis the election, as his poll numbers dropped from 49% to 42%\nnationally overnight. Other commentators thought the question itself\nwas unfair, in that it injected an irrelevant emotional element into\nthe discussion of a policy issue.\nArguably the greatest issue of the campaign was that of race and crime,\nas articulated by the Bush camp in the prison furlough program issue.\nFramed by\nLee Atwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1403979/?ls)\n, the Bush camp ran ads\nthat criticized Dukakis for a prison furlough program that resulted in\nthe release of convicted murderer\nWillie Horton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2715436/?ls)\n, an African\nAmerican, who committed a rape and assault in Maryland after fleeing\nMassachusetts. While it was\nAl Gore (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330722/?ls)\nduring the Democratic primaries that was the first candidate to\npublicly raise the furlough issue and highlight the fact that a\nfurloughed prisoner had broken into a house, raped a woman and beaten\nher husband, Gore never mentioned Horton by name or highlighted the\nfact that he black, as the TV ads did merely by running his picture.\nDespite the fact that the furlough program was started before Dukakis'\ngubernatorial administration and that the federal government under\nRonald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ls)\nhad a similar\nprogram that had resulted in similar outcomes, candidate Bush decided\nto play the race and crime card to boost his candidacy. Bush mentioned\nHorton by name in a speech in June 1988 and an \"independent\" political\naction committee (PAC) legally not affiliated with the Bush campaign,\nthe National Security Political Action Committee, aired an ad entitled\n\"Weekend Passes\" which used a mug shot image of the African American\nHorton. The Bush campaign refused to repudiate it, and indeed, followed\nit up with its own, official campaign ad, \"Revolving Door,\" criticizing\nDukakis over the furlough program without mentioning Horton.\nThe first Bush to be president also hammered on the patriotism theme\n(and unlike his son, an errant National Guard pilot during the Vietnam\nWar, George H.W. Bush was an authentic war hero, serving honorably\nduring the Second World War) to undermine Dukakis by portraying him as\nsoft on defense, in regards to the controversial \"Star Wars\" Space\nDefense Initiative program, which Dukakis promised to scale down. The\nresponse to this provocation lead to a public relations disaster when\nthe Dukakis campaign engineered a photo-op at the General Dynamics\nplant in Michigan in September 1988, in which The Duke was photographed\ndriving an M1 Abrams tank. Filmed wearing a safety helmet that seemed\ntoo large for his head, Dukakis looked awkward, out of place, and\ndecidedly uncomfortable in such a military setting. Footage of Dukakis\nwas used by the Bush campaign as evidence he would not make a good\ncommander-in-chief, and \"Dukakis in the tank\" is still shorthand among\npolitical operatives for disastrous public relations outings.\nThe campaign arguably was the dirtiest since the 19th century until\nBush's son ran for reelection against John Kerry in 2004. Dukakis lost\nthe 1988 election and retired from active politics after his\ngubernatorial term expired in 1991. The \"Massachusetts Miracle\" expired\nduring the lead up to the recession that gripped America in the Bush\nadministration, and The Duke's popularity withered as he was forced to\nsignificantly raise taxes. He did not run for a fourth term in 1990;\ncontroversial Boston University President John Silber, a social\nreactionary who was dubbed by Ronald Reagan his \"Favorite Demcorat\" won\nthe Democratic gubernatorial nomination, and narrowly lost the general\nelection to\nWilliam Weld (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1695334/?ls)\n, ushering in\nnearly two decades of Republican governors in the heavily Democratic\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts.\nAfter the end of his term, he served on the board of directors for\nAmtrak. Splitting his time between Boston and Los Angeles, California,\nhe became a professor of political science at Boston's Northeastern\nUniversity and a visiting professor of public policy at the University\nof California, Los Angeles. Dukakis has recently developed a strong\npassion for grassroots campaigning and the appointment of precinct\ncaptains to coordinate local campaigning activities, two strategies he\nfeels are essential for the Democratic Party to compete effectively in\nboth local and national elections. His policies have become gospel to\nHoward Dean, the head of the Democratic Central Committee. He also has\ntaken a strong role in advocating for effective public transportation\nand high speed rail as a solution to automobile congestion and the lack\nof space at airports.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0321320/?ref_=ls_i_36)\n36.

His mother then moved to New Orleans. Bill Clinton initially grew up with his grandparents. In 1950 his mother returned to Hope. That same year she married car dealer Roger Clinton. As a member of a student delegation from the patriotic American Legion, Clinton met in Washington D.C. with President John F. Kennedy. Clinton was interested in politics from a young age. After graduating from high school, he studied international relations at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. until 1968. He then studied law at Yale and Oxford Universities on a scholarship until 1973. During his studies, Clinton was already involved in various student organizations. He played saxophone in a jazz band and supported himself as a staffer in the office of Senator J. William Fulbright. In 1968, Clinton received a \"Rhodes Scholarship\" that allowed him to travel to the University of Oxford, England.\nFrom 1970 he studied law at Yale University. After receiving his doctorate in 1973, he briefly worked for the House Judiciary Committee. From 1973 to 1976 he was appointed to the University of Arkansas School of Law. In 1974 he ran for a seat in the House of Representatives, but was narrowly defeated by the Republican incumbent John-Paul Hammerschmidt. In 1975, Bill Clinton married Hillary Rodham, Hillary Clinton. In 1976, Clinton was elected to the office of Attorney General of Arkansas. Two years later, in 1978, at just 32 years old, he was appointed governor of Arkansas, the youngest head of government of an American state at the time. After two years he resigned from the senatorial office. His daughter Chelsea was born in 1980. From 1980 to 1983, Bill Clinton worked at the law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings in Little Rock. At the end of 1983 he was re-elected as governor of Arkansas. In 1985 he became a co-founder of the \"Democratic Leadership Council\" and from 1990 its chairman.\nFrom 1986 to 1987, Clinton served as chairman of the National Governors Association. In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president. In July 1991 he was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate. Senator Al Gore, who was running for vice-presidency, went into the election campaign with him. Throughout the entire election campaign, Bill Clinton was in the lead by a clear margin, not least because of his successful connection to the historical myth of former President John F Kennedy. In the presidential election on November 3, 1992, Clinton won over the incumbent George H. W. Bush. He then moved into the White House on January 20, 1993 as the 42nd President of the United States of America. At 46, he was the third youngest president in the history of the United States, after Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. Clinton's top priorities during his term in office were the introduction of health insurance, reconciliation with Vietnam, and combating drug abuse, gun violence, and poverty in the United States and the world.\nOn foreign policy matters, Clinton visited Germany on July 10, 1994. In Berlin he gave a speech in which Clinton, like John F. Kennedy in 1963, said in German \"America is at your side - now and forever.\" In 1994 he received an honorary doctorate from Oxford University. In terms of foreign policy, he supported the Israeli-Jordanian peace process, which led to the peace treaty between the two countries. At the CSCE summit in Budapest in 1995, Clinton, Boris Yeltsin and the presidents of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan exchanged views on the instruments of ratification of the START I Agreement. The Treaty on the Reduction of Nuclear Weapons with a Range of More Than 5,500 km, signed in 1991, thus came into force. In the following presidential election in November 1996, Clinton was able to clearly assert himself in office against Bob Dole. The summit meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Clinton in Helsinki ended in March 1997 without an agreement on the dispute over NATO's eastern expansion. In May 1997, Clinton traveled to Mexico on an official visit. It was the first visit by a US president to the neighboring country since 1979.\nIn May 1997, the \"Basic Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between the North Atlantic Organization and the Russian Federation\" was signed in Paris. After a long budget dispute between the administration and Congress, an agreement on tax cuts was reached. The US budget was brought out of the red for the first time since 1969. President Clinton's second term was overshadowed by allegations of sexually assaulting government employee Paula Jones in a hotel room in 1991. Clinton denied the accusation.\nFor the first time in the history of the United States, a sitting president testified under oath on his own behalf on January 17, 1998. On January 26, 1998, Clinton reaffirmed his sworn statement that he had not had an extramarital affair with his intern, Monica Lewinsky. Clinton also rejected the accusation that he had incited Lewinsky to make false statements with an affidavit. For the first time in 130 years, i.e. H. Since the presidency of Andrew Johnson, impeachment proceedings have again been opened against an American president in office.\nClinton later revised his statement. However, at the end of the investigation in 1999, the allegations were not sufficient for either impeachment or indictment. In March 1998, Clinton became the first US president to undertake an extensive tour of southern Africa. As part of this trip, he announced debt relief for African reform states. Paula Jones' lawsuit against Clinton was dismissed by the Arkansas federal court in April 1998. After bombings at the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the US fired cruise missiles at six suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan in retaliation on August 20, 1998. In October 1998, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat signed a peace agreement in Washington at Clinton's initiative. This got the peace process in the Middle East, which had been stalled for almost two years, back on track. Despite protests from the Chinese government, Clinton received the Dalai Lama at the White House in November 1998. As a result of the 2000 hacker attacks on the World Wide Web, a conference on Internet security issues began in Washington. Clinton advocated for a national security center.\nOn June 2, 2000, during his visit to Germany, Bill Clinton became the first US president to receive the International Charlemagne Prize from the city of Aachen. In his laudatory speech, Gerhard Schröder praised Clinton's commitment to growing together in Europe. That same month, he became the first U.S. president to deliver a speech to the Russian parliament. He offered Russia comprehensive cooperation. During his three-day visit to Moscow, he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and privately visited former President Boris Yeltsin. At the turn of the millennium, Bill Clinton completed his term as one of the most successful presidents of the United States. Above all, his commitment to new companies and technologies gave the USA the longest economic rise in its history. His successor as US President was George W. Bush, who was sworn in as the 43rd President of the United States on February 20, 2001. On June 22, 2004, Bill Clinton published his biography entitled \"My Life\" in New York. The almost 1,000-page work was pre-ordered two million times before publication.\nBill Clinton underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery in New York on September 6, 2004, but he survived without incident. The former US President is committed to fighting poverty, corruption and climate change worldwide with his \"Clinton Global Initiative\", which held its first conference in New York in mid-September 2005.

Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to\nAurelia Schwarzenegger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9134375/?ls)\n(born Jadrny) and Gustav\nSchwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a\nkeen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete\nin several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated\nto the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star\nbegan to rise.\nUp until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather\noddball sport, or even a mis-understood \"freak show\" by the general\npublic, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers\nBen Weider (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2366221/?ls)\nand\nJoe Weider (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0917755/?ls)\nset about broadening the appeal of\n\"pumping iron\" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster\nboy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \"Austrian\nOak\", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in\n1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding\nwinning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with\nit, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new\ninternational audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide\nswelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire\nflourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe.\nHowever, Schwarzenegger's horizons were bigger than just the landscape\nof bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \"Arnold Strong\" in the low\nbudget\nHercules in New York (1970) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065832/?ls)\n,\nthen director\nBob Rafelson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0706182/?ls)\ncast Arnold in\nStay Hungry (1976) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075268/?ls)\nalongside\nJeff Bridges (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000313/?ls)\nand\nSally Field (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000398/?ls)\n, for which Arnold won a Golden\nGlobe Award for \"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\". The\nmesmerizing\nPumping Iron (1977) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/?ls)\ncovering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on\nto become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus\nArnold landed other acting roles in the comedy\nThe Villain (1979) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080097/?ls)\nopposite\nKirk Douglas (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000018/?ls)\n, and he portrayed\nMickey Hargitay (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0362927/?ls)\nin the well- received TV\nmovie\nThe Jayne Mansfield Story (1980) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080947/?ls)\n.\nWhat Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a\nlavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him\nroom to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor.\nConan the Barbarian (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082198/?ls)\nwas just that role. Inspired by the\nRobert E. Howard (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397574/?ls)\nshort stories of the\n\"Hyborean Age\" and directed by gung ho director\nJohn Milius (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587518/?ls)\n, and with a largely unknown\ncast, save\nMax von Sydow (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001884/?ls)\nand\nJames Earl Jones (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000469/?ls)\n, \"Conan\" was a smash\nhit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled\nConan the Destroyer (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087078/?ls)\nquickly followed. If \"Conan\" was the kick start to Arnold's movie\ncareer, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and\naccelerate his star status into overdrive. Director\nJames Cameron (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000116/?ls)\nhad until that time\nonly previously directed one earlier feature film titled\nPiranha II: The Spawning (1982) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082910/?ls)\n, which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for\nan actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator -\nThe Terminator (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/?ls)\n. Made on a\nrelatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction\nthriller\nThe Terminator (1984) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/?ls)\nwas\nincredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable\nfilm franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \"I'll be back\" quickly\nbecame part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in\nvogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold\nreap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals\nwho used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done.\nThe testosterone laden\nCommando (1985) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088944/?ls)\n,\nRaw Deal (1986) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091828/?ls)\n,\nPredator (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/?ls)\n,\nThe Running Man (1987) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093894/?ls)\nand\nRed Heat (1988) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095963/?ls)\nwere all box office hits\nand Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking\nwinning scripts.

From 1954 to 1957 he served in the US Navy. He was subsequently represented in the US Congress several times as a member of the Republican Party. In 1954 Rumsfeld married Joyce Pierson, with whom he had three children. In the years 1969/70 and 1971/72, Rumsfeld served as economic advisor to President Richard Nixon. In 1973/74 he served as US envoy to NATO. Under President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Rumsfeld was elevated to White House chief of staff in 1974/75. He served as Secretary of Defense under the same President from 1975 to 1977. After Ford left the presidency, Rumsfeld also lost his political office in 1977. He now turned to business, holding senior positions at G. D. Searle and Company from 1977 to 1985.\nFrom 1985 to 1990, Rumsfeld served as a senior advisor to William Blair and Company. From 1990 to 1993 he worked as a manager for General Instrument Corporation and from 1997 to 2000 for Gilead Sciences, Inc. Rumsfeld received 11 academic honorary degrees. He was, among other things, Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Eisenhower Medal in 1993. Rumsfeld was given the opportunity to make a political comeback in 2001 when George W. Bush became president. Since then he has taken up the office of Defense Minister again. In this role, he was at the center of global attention, especially after the terrorist attack on the USA on September 11, 2001 and during the US military strike against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan a few months later. Since the summer of 2002, in connection with the preparations for a US attack on Iraq, the world's attention has once again been focused on the statements of the veteran US Secretary of Defense.\nAs a supporter of his president's war policy, Rumsfeld increasingly overshadows Secretary of State Colin Powell, who dissents from it. Although Rumsfeld came under increasing public criticism over the Iraq War due to allegations of torture against American soldiers, he was able to retain his office during President Bush's second term in office after his re-election in November 2004. After the Iraq War, Rumsfeld emerged primarily as a warning about Iran's terrorist potential and China's growing military power. In 2004/05, the American Secretary of Defense made three trips to Latin America to ensure the support of the local governments in the US dispute with Venezuela. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has long been trying to forge an \"Axis of the South\" against the North American superpower in order to give the South American countries back their autonomy. He also concluded an alliance with the Cuban head of state Fidel Castro.\nFollowing the Republican defeat in the 2006 congressional elections, Bush announced Rumsfeld's resignation as Secretary of Defense on November 8, 2006. The US administration was responding to ongoing criticism of the deployment of American soldiers in Iraq. Robert Gates was nominated as his successor. His memoirs were published in February 2011 under the title \"Known and Unknown: A Memoir\".\nDonald Rumsfeld died on June 29, 2021 in Taos, New Mexico.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124133/?ref_=ls_i_42)\n42. George W. Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124133/?ref_=ls_t_42)\nCamera and Electrical Department\nAdditional Crew\nSoundtrack\nJourneys with George (2002) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312848/?ref_=ls_knf_42)\nThe 43rd President of the United States of America, George Walker Bush (known colloquially as \"W\" to distinguish himself from his father,\nGeorge Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124132/?ls)\n, the 41st president of the U.S.), was born two days after the national holiday of the Fourth of July, 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut. There, his father was attending Yale College in the Class of 1949. His mother was\nBarbara Bush (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124093/?ls)\n(the former Barbara Pierce), whom his father had married on January 6, 1945. \"W\" was their first child. Bush disliked being called \"Junior\" or Bush II, or even having the term \"Jr.\" abbreviated next to his name.\nInitially, W's prospects of living up to his illustrious pedigree were dim. Possibly hobbled by dyslexia (a condition little understood and seldom treated during his childhood), Bush proved an uninspired student in high school. He did maintain a gentlemanly \"C+\" average at Yale and acquired a Masters of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School, but until he turned 40, he seemed to be floundering. He admittedly had a drinking problem in his youth, but a late marriage to Laura Welch helped stabilize him. His rebirth as a believing Christian (he is a Methodist whereas his parents were Episcopalian) in 1986 helped put him on the straight and narrow path that led him to the Presidency.\nBush has been discounted many times in his life and career for being wooden and unintelligent due to his fractured speaking style, but in fact, his academic performance was on par if not slightly better than that of his better-spoken, fellow Yalie\nJohn Kerry (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449902/?ls)\n. As Bush's test scores and subsequent achievements suggest an above average intelligence, it is appropriate to believe that he likely has benefited from other's underestimation of his gifts. This was apparent in the first televised debate with\nAl Gore (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330722/?ls)\nin 2000, when Bush held his own against the condescending vice president, and in doing so, triumphed in the eyes of the political handicappers.\nAfter W. turned his life around in the late 1980s, he began achieving success on his own, though that success inevitably was indebted to his social position and his father's business and political connections, particularly after he himself ascended to the Presidency after the expiration of\nRonald Reagan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/?ls)\n's second term. The first President Bush (Bush 41, as he is colloquially known) had great connections in the Middle East, particularly with the Saudi royal family and the powerful Bin Laden clan. Using his father's Saudi connections, Bush Jr. became a millionaire twice over through Middle Eastern oil projects. His most notable achievement in private life was in becoming president and chief operating partner of the Texas Rangers professional baseball team, which was financially invigorated by the building of a new stadium with taxpayers' funds. For a man whose greatest ambition was not the presidency but to be baseball commissioner, the \"job\" of Rangers owner suited him just fine, and his stint as the amiable owner of the team helped generate good publicity that wiped out his past image as a playboy. When he cashed out his ownership stake, Bush had a $14 million profit. More importantly, ownership of the Rangers positioned him financially and in the public eye for a successful run for the governorship of Texas, which proved to be his springboard to the presidency.\nUnder the quirky Texas constitution, the governor of Texas is primarily a ceremonial position, somewhat akin to that of the president in a Parliamentary system. The true political power in Texas lies with the lieutenant governor, who acts as a prime minister (or provincial premier in Canada) in that that he/she runs the legislature. In a life characterized by luck, the capricious Bush was luckier still in that he was told by the lieutenant governor, a Democrat, that he would make Bush a great governor if he would let him. Bush did and established an enviable reputation, one that crossed both party lines in Texas, where it would have been futile for the governor to act in a partisan fashion.\nWith his father's Eastern Establishment credentials that linked him to the \"Rockefeller Republicans\" (conservative on financial matters, liberal on social issues) and his mother's own noted social liberalism, Bush was seen as being a moderate with a difference. That difference was his connections to the powerful evangelical Christian wing of the Republican Party, due to his own rebirth as a believing Christian and his immersion in day-to-day Texas politics. In the Sun Belt, fundamentalists and evangelicals were considered ordinary, run-of-the-day folk, not the exotics that Washington and the Eastern Establishment looked at them as.\nWith a foot in both wings of the party, Bush was seen as a natural candidate for president after\nBob Dole (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230909/?ls)\n's dolorous 1996 candidacy. That he was a \"straight shooter\" with no scandal attached to him since his misbegotten youth (which he had confessed to and had put behind him) made him attractive to the Republicans, who had tried to terminate William Jefferson Clinton's presidency through impeachment due to his lies linked to his \"bimbo eruptions.\" Bush seemed like a \"Man for All Seasons\" that would be the GOP's best shot of unseating the Clintonistas as represented by Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election.\nWith the Republican Establishment firmly behind him as a kind of \"Great White Hope\" of the Grand Old Party, Bush managed to wrap up the nomination easily, after stumbling initially when confronted with the candidacy of the renegade Republican senator from Arizona,\nJohn McCain (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564587/?ls)\n. Although viewed by most Republicans as a RINO (Republican in name only), McCain dominated the early primaries in states that allowed cross over voting by attracting middle-of-the-road independents and conservative Democrats, but stumbled himself when the primary season headed South. He was badly defeated by Bush in South Carolina, a deeply conservative state that had voted for favorite son (and segregationist)\nStrom Thurmond (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2493440/?ls)\nin 1948, uber-conservative\nBarry Goldwater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326400/?ls)\nin 1964, and segregationist\nGeorge Wallace (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908650/?ls)\nin 1968. McCain also was victimized by smear tactics, such as the whispering campaign started by Mississippi Senator\nTrent Lott (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1711619/?ls)\nthat claimed the renegade McCain had been mentally discombobulated by his seven years as a POW in Vietnam. The dirty tricks used against McCain by Bush campaign manager/major domo\nKarl Rove (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1311211/?ls)\nwould prove to be harbingers of the paranoid style of politics that would come to fruition during Bush's first term.\nMcCain, a maverick senator with the support of many moderate Republicans and Independents as well as a following among conservative Democrats, was not only smeared, but his attempts to get on the ballot in such states as New York were stymied until the federal courts stepped in. (In 2004, even though he endorsed Bush against Kerry, McCain found himself smeared again by elements connected with Karl Rove when he defended Kerry's war record and patriotism.) The Republican Establishment were determined to give the nomination to a true blue Republican who could win (the color red was not associated with the GOP until Election Night 2000, when it was used as the map color for the Party after a century wherein the Republicans were blue and the Democrats red). After his defeat of McCain in South Carolina, Bush had as easy a time wrapping up the nomination as if he had been an incumbent.\nAt the beginning of the fall campaign, what with the U.S. still enjoying the tail end of almost eight years of prosperity under President\nBill Clinton (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001051/?ls)\n, his vice president, Al Gore, started out as a prohibitive favorite to win the presidency. Gore, whoever, turned out to be unable to shed his past reputation as an uninspiring campaigner, and failed to fire up the uncommitted. Bush, on the other hand, a relative unknown commodity who had enjoyed good press for the past decade as a baseball owner and governor, did not make many errors after appearing at Bob Jones University several weeks after it had banned interracial dating during the early Republican primaries (for which he apologized). He capitalized on the low expectations others had for him, and won respect - and votes - for going the distance without stumbling or embarrassing himself, while Gore had to live down the bimbo eruptions of his past running mate and his own faux pas, such as his claim to have invented the \"Information Superhighway\" (Internet). His stiff, \"Wooden Indian\" style came off as pompous on the campaign trail, giving Bush's persona a boost as it could have been portrayed as bumbling if he had been up against a natural born campaigner such as Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan.\nIn the game of politics as played in the US, Gore had everything to lose and Bush had everything to gain. Gore had to rise and exceed expectations while Bush merely had to live up to lowered expectations to rise above them and gain credence, and he did, beginning with the first debate. Going into the first debate, pundits expected the better-spoken Gore to eviscerate the syntactically challenged Bush (whose intelligence they disparaged), but it did not happen. Gore was haughty, and since Bush held his own, the governor of Texas was adjudged the winner. From there to the end of the campaign, Gore could never consolidate his early lead, which slipped away.\nOn election day, Bush and Gore were locked in a dead heat. In the closest election in a century, it all came down to a matter of 537 votes in Florida. Out of the nearly six million votes cast in the Sunshine State (5,861,785 total, with 36,742 won by third party candidates), Bush was certified as the winner, with a margin representing 0.0087%, less than nine one-thousandths of a percentage point.\nAfter a long drawn-out process involving recounts and court challenges, Bush took the oath of office on January 20, 2001 and won re-election in November 2004 to become the first son of a president to win two terms in office.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330722/?ref_=ls_i_43)\n43.

His mother, Stanley\nAnn Dunham (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5023778/?ls)\n, was a white American from Wichita, Kansas. His father,\nBarack Obama Sr. (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3381194/?ls)\n, who was black, was from Alego, Kenya. They were both young college students at the University of Hawaii. When his father left for Harvard, his mother and Barack stayed behind, and his father ultimately returned alone to Kenya, where he worked as a government economist. Barack's mother remarried an Indonesian oil manager and moved to Jakarta when Barack was six. He later recounted Indonesia as simultaneously lush and a harrowing exposure to tropical poverty. He returned to Hawaii, where he was brought up largely by his grandparents. The family lived in a small apartment - his grandfather was a furniture salesman and an unsuccessful insurance agent and his grandmother worked in a bank - but Barack managed to get into Punahou School, Hawaii's top prep academy. His father wrote to him regularly but, though he traveled around the world on official business for Kenya, he visited only once, when Barack was ten. Obama attended Columbia University, but found New York's racial tension inescapable. He became a community organizer for a small Chicago church-based group for three years, helping poor South Side residents cope with a wave of plant closings. He then attended Harvard Law School, and in 1990 became the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review. He turned down a prestigious judicial clerkship, choosing instead to practice civil-rights law back in Chicago, representing victims of housing and employment discrimination and working on voting-rights legislation. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago Law School, and married Michelle Robinson (now\nMichelle Obama (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2349292/?ls)\n, a fellow attorney; their daughters are\nSasha Obama (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3127877/?ls)\nand\nMalia Obama (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3078497/?ls)\n. Eventually, he was elected to the Illinois state senate, where his district included both Hyde Park and some of the poorest ghettos on the South Side. In 2004, Obama was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, representing Illinois, and he gained national attention by giving a rousing and well-received keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. In 2008 he ran for President, and despite having only four years of national political experience, he won. In January 2009, he was sworn in as the 44th President of the United States, and the first African-American ever elected to that position. Obama was re-elected to a second term in November 2012 - and was sworn in in January 2013.

At birth, he was named Willard Mitt after his father's best friend and hotelier, J. Willard Marriott, plus his father's cousin, Milton \"Mitt\" Romney, a pro football player who was the quarterback of the Chicago Bears. His mother was an aspiring actress who turned down a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to marry George. Of English, Scottish, and German ancestry, Mitt's father was born in Colonia Dublán, Galeana, Chihuahua, Mexico, to American parents.\nGeorge Romney eventually served as the head of the Detroit-based automaker, American Motors, and as a popular three-term governor of Michigan before launching his own aborted bid for the 1968 Republican Presidential nomination. A moderate Republican, who was a liberal on civil rights in the mold of President\nDwight D. Eisenhower (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252032/?ls)\n, George served in the first cabinet of President\nRichard Nixon (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633271/?ls)\nas his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. George also was an important figure in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as was his son, Mitt.\nMitt served as a Mormon missionary in France before marrying his high school sweetheart,\nAnn Romney (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4965461/?ls)\n(nee Davies), in 1969. Mitt had met Ann when he was attending public elementary school and began dating her in his senior year, when he was attending the prep school Cranbrook, where he was the lone Mormon. (Anne, who was not a Mormon, was attending Cranbrook's sister school, Kingswood). His father oversaw Anne's conversion while he was away in France. The couple eventually would have five sons.\nAfter graduating from Brigham Young University, he earned a joint J.D. (law) degree and M.B.A. at Harvard University. Remaining in the Boston area, he became a management consultant, eventually winding up at Bain & Co., where he became the C.E.O. He created the spin-off private equity investment company, Bain Capital, which made him a multimillionaire with a fortune conservatively estimated at $250 million.\nA political independent, he registered as a Republican and won the GOP 1994 nomination for the U.S. Senate in the 1994, taking on the very popular incumbent,\nTed Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448356/?ls)\n, who was not only the scion of Massachusetts' greatest political family but a political powerhouse in his own right. Though Romney lost the election 41% to Kennedy's 58%, it was the smallest margin of victory Teddy had experienced since first being elected to the Senate in 1962 when his brother\nJohn F. Kennedy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448123/?ls)\nwas in the White House. (In his previous election, 1988, Teddy had won over the Republican nominee 65% to 34% and, in the next election, 2000, he trounced the Republican nominee 73% to 13%). In 2002, Romney took a sabbatical from business to manage the scandal-plagued Salt Lake Organizing Committee that was responsible for putting on the 2002 Winter Olympics. With a steady hand, he eliminated the problems that threatened the Olympics. The 2002 Olympics turned out to be a success.\nThat same year, he won the Republican gubernatorial nomination for the state of Massachusetts. He ran, unopposed, to win the Republican nomination; then beat the Democrat, State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien, 50% to 45% in the general election.\nAs Governor of Massachusetts, his signature accomplishments were eliminating a budget deficit, projected at $3 billion, by hiking fees and implementing spending cuts, and signing a law mandating universal health insurance. Though not as liberal as previous Republican Governor\nWilliam Weld (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1695334/?ls)\n, he was considered a moderate.\nWith his poll numbers lagging at the end of his first term, indicating that he'd have a tough time winning re-election, Mitt demurred from seeking a second term. He already had his eye on the Presidency.\nRomney had made many trips to neighboring New Hampshire, the site of the nation's first presidential primary, while still Governor, and continued to do so in the year after he left office in January 2007. However, U.S. Senator\nJohn McCain (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564587/?ls)\n, a Granite State favorite (who had won the New Hampshire primary in 2000), bested Romney in the primary held on January 8, 2008. At the end of January 2008, Romney spent $90 million, $35 million of which was his own money, for the 2008 U.S. Republican presidential nomination. Though he did eventually win several primaries and caucuses, he failed to win in Florida and dropped out of the race on February 7, 2008, two days after his disappointing showing on \"Super Tuesday\". He endorsed McCain a week later.\nRomney was questioned by federal courts on topics of campaign monies. Freed of constraints on campaign cash by the Supreme Court decision, Citizens United vs. F.E.C., Romney and his allies have spent much more than $90 million in the 2012 election cycle. Some opponents to Romney feel that in the Florida primary, alone, he won because of the money spent on advertising the campaign. Romney and his allies spent $15.4 million on TV and radio ads, which was $3.4 million more than\nJohn McCain (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564587/?ls)\nspent on ads during the entire primary cycle of his 2008 campaign. In 2012, much had changed from 2008, though. Computers and social media now play a huge role in getting messages to every person in America who vote. This required spending much more money than in the past.

Bloomberg is an entrepreneur and philanthropist who served three terms as Mayor of the City of New York.\nMichael Rubens Bloomberg was in Boston, the son of Charlotte (Rubens) and William Henry Bloomberg, an accountant. He is of Russian Jewish descent. He was raised in a middle class home in Medford, Massachusetts. Michael attended Johns Hopkins University, where he paid his tuition by taking out loans and working as a parking lot attendant. After college, he attended Harvard Business School and in 1966 was hired by a Wall Street firm, Salomon Brothers, for an entry-level job.\nBloomberg quickly rose through the ranks at Salomon, overseeing equity trading and sales before heading up the firm's information systems. When Salomon was acquired in 1981, he was let go from the firm. With a vision of an information technology company that would bring transparency and efficiency to the buying and selling of financial securities, he launched a small startup in a one room office. Today, Bloomberg LP is a global company that has more than 15,500 employees and offices in 73 countries around the world.\nDuring his tenure as mayor, from 2002 through 2013, Bloomberg brought his innovation-driven approach to city government. He turned around a broken public school system by raising standards and holding schools accountable for success. He spurred economic growth and record levels of job creation by revitalizing old industrial areas, spurring entrepreneurship, supporting small businesses, and strengthening key industries, including new media, film and television, bio-science, technology, and tourism. Mayor Bloomberg's economic policies helped New York City experience record-levels of private-sector job growth often in formerly depressed neighborhoods, even in the wake of the deep national recession.\nHis passion for public health led to ambitious new strategies that became national models, including a ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces, as well as at parks and beaches. Life expectancy grew by 36 months during Mayor Bloomberg's twelve years in office. He launched cutting-edge anti-poverty efforts, including the Young Men's Initiative and the Center for Economic Opportunity, whose ground-breaking programs have been replicated across the country. As a result, New York City's welfare rolls fell 25 percent, and New York was the only big city in the country not to experience an increase in poverty between the 2000 Census and 2012. He also created innovative plans to fight climate change and promote sustainable development, which helped cut the city's carbon footprint by 19 percent. His belief that America's mayors and business leaders can help effect change in Washington led him to launch national bi-partisan coalitions to combat illegal guns, reform immigration, and invest in infrastructure. He was a strong champion of the city's cultural community, expanding support for artists and arts organizations and helping to bring more than 100 permanent public art commissions to all five boroughs.\nUpon leaving City Hall, Michael Bloomberg returned to the company he founded while also devoting more time to philanthropy, which has been a top priority for him throughout his career. Today, Bloomberg Philanthropies employs a unique data-driven approach to global change that grows out of his experiences as an entrepreneur and mayor. In addition to Bloomberg Philanthropies' five areas of focus - public health, arts and culture, the environment, education, and government innovation - Bloomberg has continued to support projects of great importance to him, including his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, where he served as the chairman of the board of trustees from 1996-2001. The university's School of Hygiene and Public Health - the largest public health facility in the U.S. - is named the Bloomberg School of Public Health in recognition of his commitment and support. Bloomberg has donated more than $4.3 billion to a wide variety of causes and organizations.\nAs chair of the C40 Climate Leadership Group from 2010 to 2013, Bloomberg drew international attention to cities' leading role in the fight against climate change. In 2014, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Bloomberg to be U.N. Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change where he is focusing on helping cities and countries set and achieve more ambitious climate change goals. In 2016, Bloomberg accepted World Health Organization director-general Margaret Chan's invitation to serve as the WHO global ambassador for noncommunicable diseases as part of the WHO's push to achieve UN goals of reducing premature NCD deaths by one-third by 2030, and halving the number of road deaths and injuries by 2020.\nMichael Bloomberg is the father of two daughters, Emma and Georgina.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1932882/?ref_=ls_i_52)\n52.

A member of the Republican Party, he was the U.S. Representative for Georgia's 6th congressional district from 1979 until his resignation in 1999. In 2012, Gingrich was a candidate for the presidential nomination of his party.\nA professor of history and geography at the University of West Georgia in the 1970s, Gingrich won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1978, the first Republican in the history of Georgia's 6th congressional district to do so. He served as House Minority Whip from 1989 to 1995. A co-author and architect of the \"Contract with America\", Gingrich was a major leader in the Republican victory in the 1994 congressional election. In 1995, Time named him \"Man of the Year\" for \"his role in ending the four-decades-long Democratic majority in the House\".\nAs House Speaker, Newt Gingrich oversaw passage by the House of welfare reform and a capital gains tax cut in 1997. Gingrich played a key role in several government shutdowns. He resigned altogether from the House on January 3, 1999.\nSince leaving the House, Newt Gingrich has remained active in public policy debates and worked as a political consultant. He founded and chaired several policy think tanks, including American Solutions for Winning the Future and the Center for Health Transformation. He ran for the Republican nomination in the 2012 presidential election, but ultimately endorsed front runner\nMitt Romney (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1797713/?ls)\n, who won the nomination.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874339/?ref_=ls_i_62)\n62. Donald Trump (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874339/?ref_=ls_t_62)\nProducer\nActor\nWriter\nThe Apprentice (2004–2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364782/?ref_=ls_knf_62)\nThe Trump family were German immigrants. Donald Trump's father became a multi-millionaire by building tenements in the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. After graduating from high school, Donald Trump studied economics at Fordham University and graduated from University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He gained his first professional experience in his father's company, and in 1974 he set up his own business in Manhattan. In 1975, Trump bought the old Commodore Hotel in New York and five years later he opened the Grand Hyatt Hotel New York. Donald quickly became known for his willingness to take risks. Trump quickly built up a considerable fortune through real estate in New York. In 1977 he married Ivana Trump. The marriage produced sons Donald Jr. (1977) and Eric (1984) and daughter Ivanka (1981). The divorce took place in 1992. In the 1980s, Trump divided his business areas into real estate, gaming, hotels and residential and commercial buildings, which were reunited under the umbrella of a holding company.\nTrump achieved international popularity in 1983 with the construction of the \"Trump Tower\" on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The building is 202 meters high and has 58 floors. Like John D. Rockefeller, Trump created a monument to his wealth in New York. In 1989, Donald Trump acquired the American airline Eastern Airlines, which he renamed as \"Trump Shuttle\" after the purchase. However, following poor operating figures, the company was sold again after three years. In 1990, Trump opened a gigantic hotel-casino called \"Trump - Taj Mahal\" in Atlantic City near New York. However, the construction resulted in unexpectedly high expenses. In total, commitments totaling around $3 billion were outstanding from other projects. This meant that Trump and his corporate empire were on the verge of ruin in the early 1990s. After negotiations with investors and banks, Donald Trump managed to reorganize his obligations and thus made a comeback as a major investor. He was married to Marla Maple from 1993 to 1999.\nIn 1998, the \"Trump - International Hotel and Tower\" was inaugurated at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. In addition to rental income from the Trump Tower and other exclusive commercial buildings, various casinos in New Jersey and Florida as well as large leisure centers were now also among the empire's sources of income. All facilities and business areas had Trump's name in their logo. Based on ever new gigantic construction projects, one could only speculate about his wealth. Trump owned around ten office and residential towers in excellent locations in New York alone. In 2001, Trump completed the \"Trump World Tower\" in New York. The extremely sophisticated residential and commercial high-rise in Manhattan Midtown is 262 meters high and has 72 floors. From 2003 to 2004 and 2004 to 2005, he appeared on the US television show \"The Apprentice\", in which he sought employees for his corporate empire.\nTwo years after the decision to redevelop \"Ground Zero,\" Trump came forward with a counterproposal in 2005. Instead of Daniel Libeskind's planned \"Freedom Tower,\" Trump wanted to resurrect the destroyed twin towers of the World Trade Center. The plans of the American star architect of Japanese origin Minoru Yamasaki served as a template. Trump married Melania Knauss, 28 years his junior, on January 22, 2005. Their son Barron William was born in 2006. In 2007 he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On June 16, 2015, Trump announced that he would run in the Republican primary as a candidate for the US presidential election in November 2016. In the first primary in the state of New Hampshire on February 9, 2016, Trump was able to clearly assert himself. He already had an absolute majority in May - thanks above all to his election slogan: \"Make America great again\". On July 19, 2016, Trump was officially elected as the presidential candidate at the Republican nomination convention in Cleveland. He formally accepted the election on July 21, 2016.\nOn November 8, 2016, Donald Trump won the US presidential election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. His inauguration in Washington D.C. was set for January 20, 2017 in accordance with the constitution. As President of the United States, Donald Trump pursued a rigorous government policy in all matters right from the start - according to the election motto: \"American first\", which earned him many votes. Not only was and is directly affected by the international trade community, but also US citizens with a migrant background and migrants who want to come to America.\nIn 2019, the American president recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, thereby single-handedly bringing about a momentous paradigm shift in international Middle East policy - which was undesirable by many politically involved. In the same year, 2019, he refused to sign the UN arms trade treaty ATT (Arms Trade Treaty), which has regulated international standards for the trade in conventional weapons since 2014. In addition, Trump's presidency was shaken by, among other things, the Russia affair and the Ukraine affair, which brought him impeachment proceedings, which he survived thanks to the Republican majority in the Senate. The US head of government is shaping a new style of government with his extensive use of the news medium \"Twitter\" by repeatedly disseminating important government announcements and personal opinions there. He continually describes his poor relationship with the public press with the catchphrase \"fake news\" that he has made popular, and which often catches up with his critics. Trump won the 2024 Republican nomination for president, initially campaigning against incumbent Joe Biden. However, when Biden dropped his campaign, Kamala Harris was selected to run in Biden's stead. Trump defeated Harris with both a majority and electoral win to become the 47th president. He will be only the second president to have a non-consecutive second term in office (after President Grover Cleveland).\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0761471/?ref_=ls_i_63)\n63.
