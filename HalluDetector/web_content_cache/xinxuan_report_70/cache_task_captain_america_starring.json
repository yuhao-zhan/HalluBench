the Time\n, and if God is watching, his response never varies: He keeps out of it.\nAntonio Campos’ (\nChristine\n) adaptation of the even more violent 2011 novel by Donald Ray Pollock brings a lot of talent to bear on material descended straight from Flannery O’Connor via Cormac McCarthy. Set in the ’50s and ’60s in two rural Appalachian towns, it ties faith and violence together in a less showy and obvious way than many of its predecessors. Though its structure doesn’t always work to maximum effect, the grim picture gets more involving as it goes and benefits from a hell of a cast.\nThe Bottom Line\nAn excellent cast sells this bloody but not entirely bleak adaptation.\nRelease date:\nSep 16, 2020\nThough he doesn’t appear until well into the film,\nTom Holland (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/tom-holland/)\n‘s Arvin will be the story’s heart. We meet Arvin at age 9, where he’s played by Michael Banks Repeta as the rapt son of Bill Skarsgard’s Willard. Much hopping around in time is done in these opening scenes, as the narration (read well by the novelist himself) struggles a bit to introduce the cast of characters. One scene, for instance, finds Willard and another man separately meeting the loves of their lives at the same luncheonette on the same afternoon. These four characters will be linked up, in a way, late in this decades-long tale. But being rather remote, the connection doesn’t seem worth making, given such a busy exposition.\nSkarsgard sometimes seems to channel Michael Shannon as Willard, who went on a hiatus from God after witnessing horrors in World War II, then becomes a prayerful man again. He keeps his son by his side at a makeshift altar behind the family cabin. But even the most impassioned prayers don’t keep Arvin from becoming an orphan, sent to live with his nervous grandma Emma (Kristin Griffith).\nHis new stepsister, Lenora (Eliza Scanlen), has a similarly tragic backstory. Her father (Harry Melling) was a preacher with an insane belief in the Holy Ghost’s power — instead of snake-handling, he proved his faith with a jar of spiders, and locked himself in a closet for weeks after he was disfigured by them. Her mother (\nMia Wasikowska (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/mia-wasikowska/)\n) was a gentle woman who met a sudden death.\nRelated Stories\n[No Text] (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/brooke-shields-cary-elwes-to-star-in-netflix-rom-com-a-castle-for-christmas-exclusive-4058154/)\n[No Text] (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/brooke-shields-cary-elwes-to-star-in-netflix-rom-com-a-castle-for-christmas-exclusive-4058154/)\nRelated Story (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-devil-all-the-time-film-review-4058651)\nBrooke Shields, Cary Elwes to Star in Netflix Rom-Com 'A Castle for Christmas' (Exclusive) (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/brooke-shields-cary-elwes-to-star-in-netflix-rom-com-a-castle-for-christmas-exclusive-4058154/)\nHaving inherited her father’s belief in a much quieter, more sober way, Lenora is a natural target for bullies at school, and an easy mark for the town’s new preacher (a devilish\nRobert Pattinson (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/robert-pattinson/)\n), who has an eye for very young women. Devoted Arvin knows about only one of these threats: While he handles their classmates with a cold brutality his father would’ve admired, he misses the worst predator.\nMeanwhile, a married pair of serial killers (\nRiley Keough (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/riley-keough/)\nand a chilling\nJason Clarke (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/jason-clarke/)\n) take road trips through the country, picking up hitchhikers and roping them into improvised sex-and-death rituals that Clarke’s Carl likes to photograph.\nAt least the first half of the film lays all this out in a tidy episodic fashion that, an hour or so in, begins to feel a bit tired. In each, a tragedy or crime is telegraphed well before it occurs; though no one of these sequences is clumsy by any means, the repetition diminishes their impact. (It also, as some critics of the book complained, stretches belief to envision so many killers and creeps in such a small collection of people.) Once or twice, the violence is shocking even when we know it’s coming, but often it’s just a heaping-on, and some viewers will feel like guilty participants in misery tourism.\nHolland, though, gradually takes command in the film’s second half, as Arvin feels compelled to move from beating up high schoolers to a more definitive kind of vigilantism. Arvin is a very serious young man, still shaped by boyhood tragedy, and the actor doesn’t need a lot of external theatrics to show us why Arvin has to do what he does. A nail-biting confrontation between him and Pattinson’s preacher feels like it should be the movie’s finale, but it isn’t. And this is the rare occasion when continuing on after such a sequence isn’t a mistake.\nAside from strong performances across the board, credit should be given for a predictably excellent period soundtrack chosen by music supervisors Randall Poster (also a producer here, just his fourth such credit since 1990) and Meghan Currier. Setting pared-down spirituals alongside underexposed radio hits of the day, they help\nDevil\nroot itself in the real but fictional-sounding hamlets of Knockemstiff, Ohio, and Coal Creek, West Virginia.\nProduction companies: Borderline Films, Nine Stories Productions\nDistributor: Netflix\nCast: Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgard, Riley Keough, Jason Clarke, Robert Pattinson, Eliza Scanlen, Mia Wasikowska,\nSebastian Stan (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/sebastian-stan/)\n, Michael Banks Repeta, Kristin Griffith, Haley Bennett, Harry Melling, Pokey LaFarge\nDirector: Antonio Campos\nScreenwriters: Antonio Campos, Paulo Campos\nProducers: Randall Poster, Jake Gyllenhaal, Riva Marker, Max Born\nExecutive producers: Jared Goldman, Marc A.

'Avengers: Infinity War' is acclaimed for its grand scale, exhilarating action, and Josh Brolin's standout performance as Thanos. The film is celebrated for cohesively blending numerous Marvel characters, offering significant moments for each. Yet, it faces criticism for pacing, inconsistent character strengths, and over-reliance on shock value. Humor and storytelling effectiveness receive mixed feedback, with some viewers finding them engaging, while others feel they undermine the narrative.\nAI-generated from the text of user reviews\nAction sequences\nCharacter development\nComedic brilliance\nEmotional stakes\nEpic\nGreat ensemble\nThrilling\nUnpredictable\nFeatured reviews\n10\nAlex_Lo (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur105617842/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_uname)\nBest Cliffhanger of all Time (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews/?featured=rw6566311&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_1_hd)\nA meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.\n8\nFilmdokter (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur38220046/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_uname)\nIt all led to this: superhero film at its best (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews/?featured=rw7479722&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_2_hd)\n#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.\n8\nAbdulxoxo (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur106279729/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_uname)\nA superior avengers sequel (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews/?featured=rw6564964&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_3_hd)\nAlthough this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.\nOverall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.\n9\nandreascaloni (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129540860/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_uname)\nEMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews/?featured=rw6604563&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_4_hd)\nAvengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.\nRating: 9.6.\n9\n0U (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur87850731/?ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_uname)\nGreat (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews/?featured=rw5504583&ref_=tt_ururv_genai_c_5_hd)\nThis movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n8.4\nAvengers: Endgame (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n8.0\nThe Avengers (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n7.3\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10872600/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n8.2\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10872600/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_4)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_5)\n7.8\nCaptain America: Civil War (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_5)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_6)\n7.9\nThor: Ragnarok (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_6)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_7)\n7.5\nDoctor Strange (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_7)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_8)\n7.4\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_8)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_9)\n7.7\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_9)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6320628/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_10)\n7.4\nSpider-Man: Far from Home (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6320628/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_10)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015381/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_11)\n8.0\nGuardians of the Galaxy (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015381/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_11)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_12)\n7.9\nIron Man (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_12)\nWatchlist\nStoryline (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756#storyline)\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt4154756/storyline&ref_=tt_stry)\nDid you know\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt4154756/fun-facts&tt_dyk)\nTrivia (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/trivia/?ref_=tt_dyk_trv)\nTom Holland (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4043618/?ref_=dyk_trv)\nwas not allowed to read the script for this movie, since he revealed too many secrets for\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (2017) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250912/?ref_=dyk_trv)\n.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and the 19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldaña, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In the film, the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to stop Thanos from collecting the six powerful Infinity Stones as part of his quest to kill half of all life in the universe.\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1. The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015, and a month later, Markus and McFeely signed on to write the script for the film, which draws inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 comic book The Infinity Gauntlet and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 comic book Infinity. In 2016, Marvel shortened the title to Avengers: Infinity War. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles from previous MCU films, including Brolin as Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017, shooting back-to-back with a direct sequel, Avengers: Endgame (2019). Additional filming took place in Scotland, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York City. With an estimated budget of $325–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 23, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 27 as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Brolin's performance and the Russo brothers' direction, as well as the visual effects, action sequences, dark tone, and musical score. It was a major box-office success, becoming the fourth film and the first superhero film to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous box office records, and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2018 and the fourth-highest-grossing film at the time of its release both worldwide and in the United States and Canada. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 91st Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. The sequel, Avengers: Endgame, was released in April 2019.\n\nPlot\n\nHaving acquired the Power Stone—one of six Infinity Stones—from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants—Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive—intercept the spaceship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction.[a] After subduing Thor, Thanos extracts the Space Stone from the Tesseract, overpowers the Hulk, kills Loki, and fatally wounds Heimdall. Before dying, Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifröst. Thanos and his lieutenants leave, destroying the ship.\n\nHulk crash-lands in the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to the form of Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos's plan to destroy half of all life in the universe, and they recruit Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing Peter Parker's attention. Maw, unable to take the Time Stone due to Strange's enchantment, captures him. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship while Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy respond to the Asgardian ship's distress call and rescue Thor. Thor surmises that Thanos is after the Reality Stone, which Taneleer Tivan possesses on Knowhere. He travels with Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir to enlist the dwarf king Eitri's aid in creating the battle-axe Stormbreaker. Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis travel to Knowhere, finding Thanos already has the Reality Stone. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, who discloses the Soul Stone's location to save Nebula from torture. On Vormir, the Stone's keeper, Red Skull, tells Thanos that he can only acquire it by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, earning the Stone.\n\nMidnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in Edinburgh to retrieve the Mind Stone which is in Vision's forehead. Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them and they take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision asks Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone to keep it from Thanos, but she refuses. The group travels to Wakanda, which Rogers believes has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision.\n\nNebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos's destroyed homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. The trio crash-lands on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Using the Time Stone, Strange views millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which the Avengers win. The group formulates a plan to subdue Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, with which he safely houses and wields the Stones. Thanos appears, justifying his plans as necessary to guarantee the survival of an overpopulated universe. Nebula arrives soon after and helps the others subdue Thanos, but deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks Thanos, allowing him to break the group's hold and overpower them. Thanos grievously wounds Stark, but Strange offers the Time Stone in exchange for sparing Stark's life.\n\nIn Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, along with T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Unable to summon the Hulk, Banner fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers. Together they kill Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive, and rout Thanos's army. Shuri cannot complete the extraction before Thanos arrives on the field; the Avengers and their allies fail to stop him from reaching Vision. Vision convinces a reluctant Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse her actions, rip the stone from Vision's forehead, and complete the Gauntlet. Thor severely wounds Thanos with Stormbreaker, but Thanos activates the completed Gauntlet by snapping his fingers before teleporting away.\n\nHalf of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Wanda, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, Parker, Maria Hill, and Nick Fury, the last of whom sends an emergency signal on a modified pager before disintegrating.[b] Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield. Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on a remote planet.\n\nCast\nRobert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:\nThe benefactor of the Avengers who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[6][7] Co-director Joe Russo explained that Stark \"senses this greater threat approaching, so he is doing everything in his power to keep the Earth safe\".[8] Downey added that Stark has smaller goals than in previous films.[9]\nChris Hemsworth as Thor:\nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[10] Joe Russo stated that Thor's storyline picks up after the events of Thor: Ragnarok (2017), which finds him in a \"very profound\", \"very interesting place\" with \"real emotional motivation\".[11] At the recommendation of Hemsworth, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely consulted Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi and screenwriter Eric Pearson to help carry over the comedic and tragic elements of the re-toned Thor from that film.[12] Joe Russo said that Thor has \"the driving hero's arc of the movie which stands in direct opposition to Thanos' argument\" and would have been the main protagonist of the film had Thor killed Thanos.[13]\nMark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:\nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[14][15] Banner spends the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers and \"impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is\".[16] Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that \"Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass\". Russo added that this was \"really reflective of the journey from Ragnarok [...] [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control\".[17] Banner's appearance in the film continues a story arc for the character that was established in Thor: Ragnarok and concludes in Avengers: Endgame (2019),[18] with the difference between Hulk and Banner \"starting to blur a little bit\". Ruffalo described Hulk in Infinity War as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.[16]\nChris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:\nThe fugitive leader of the non-regulation faction of Avengers. A World War II veteran, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[10] Joe Russo said after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), Rogers struggles with the conflict between his responsibility to himself and his responsibility to others. The character embodies the \"spirit\" of the comic book identity Nomad in the film,[19] and receives new vibranium gauntlets from Shuri to replace his old shield.[20] An early draft of the film had Rogers first appearing at the end of the film to save Vision from Corvus Glaive in Wakanda. Markus and McFeely were called \"insane\" for waiting that long to introduce Rogers into the film and ultimately conceded it was \"not [a] satisfying\" approach.[21]\nScarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:\nA highly trained spy, member of Rogers' faction of Avengers, and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[22] Johansson said that Romanoff's situation following Captain America: Civil War has been \"a dark time. I wouldn't say that my character has been particularly hopeful, but I think she's hardened even more than she probably was before.\"[23]\nBenedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange:\nA former neurosurgeon who, after a car accident that led to a journey of healing, discovered the hidden world of magic and alternate dimensions and became a Master of the Mystic Arts.[24][25] Markus and McFeely described Strange as \"[ending] up being the reasonable adult in the room\" with the \"widest perspective available\".[26] Julian \"JayFunk\" Daniels once again assisted Cumberbatch with his finger-tutting movements.[27]\nDon Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:\nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[28] Following his paralysis during the events of Civil War, Rhodes is given an apparatus by Stark to walk again, although he is reluctant to don his War Machine armor and rejoin the Avengers due to his injury. Cheadle believed that Rhodes is \"negotiating this reunion and his rejoining this team\". He also explained that Rhodes' relationship with Stark \"deepened\" from his accident, saying, \"I think Tony feels somewhat responsible and culpable in a way. But again, he's always had my back in a way that only he could really have\".[29]\nTom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:\nA teenager, Avenger and Stark's protégé who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[8] Downey helped coach Holland through his death scene, which was not as drawn out in the script.[30]\nChadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther:\nThe king of the African nation of Wakanda who gained his enhanced abilities by ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb.[22][31] Boseman, along with the other actors from Black Panther (2018) portraying Wakandans, improvised their war chants on set ahead of the battle in Wakanda. Despite both Black Panther and Infinity War filming at the same time, the Russos were not aware of the chants, as they had not yet seen footage from Black Panther, and felt the moment was \"incredibly cool\".[32]\nPaul Bettany as Vision:\nAn android and Avenger created using the artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, and the Mind Stone.[24] Anthony Russo called Vision \"a living MacGuffin\"; his life being in direct conflict with Thanos' quest, which \"raises the stakes\".[23]\nElizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff: A member of Rogers' faction of Avengers who can harness magic and engage in hypnosis and telekinesis.[33]\nAnthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon: A member of Rogers' faction of Avengers and former pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack.[34]\nSebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier:\nAn enhanced soldier and Rogers' ally and best friend who reemerged as a brainwashed assassin after being thought to have been killed in action during World War II.[35] Barnes, formerly known as the Winter Soldier, is given the name White Wolf by the people of Wakanda, who helped remove his Hydra programming.[20]\nTom Hiddleston as Loki:\nThor's adopted brother, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[36] Hiddleston knew about Loki's death in Infinity War prior to production of Thor: Ragnarok after meeting the Russos in May 2016, with his death being the first scene of the film that the Russos had conceptualized.[37] Hiddleston's knowledge of Loki's fate in Infinity War influenced his portrayal in Ragnarok. On Loki's final moments, Hiddleston believed it was \"very powerful\" that Loki calls himself \"Odinson\", as it was a moment that \"closes the whole journey of Loki\", while his death \"takes the stakes up dramatically\", establishing the threat of Thanos.[38]\nIdris Elba as Heimdall: The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian and former sentry of the Bifröst Bridge, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[39]\nPeter Dinklage as Eitri: King of the Dwarves of Nidavellir, and weaponsmith, based on the Norse mythological dwarf of the same name.[40]\nBenedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of Kamar-Taj's most valuable relics and books.[41]\nPom Klementieff as Mantis: A member of the Guardians with empathic powers.[42]\nKaren Gillan as Nebula: An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[43]\nDave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer:\nA member of the Guardians and warrior in search of vengeance against Thanos for killing his family.[24] At the end of each day of filming, Bautista would have to sit in a sauna to remove his makeup.[44]\nZoe Saldaña as Gamora: A member of the Guardians who is an orphan from an alien world and was subsequently raised by Thanos, and is seeking redemption for her past crimes.[45] Ariana Greenblatt portrays a young Gamora.[46]\nVin Diesel as Groot:\nA member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid.[47] Executive producer James Gunn explained that Groot is still an adolescent in the film, in the same state of growth seen in one of the post-credit scenes in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).[48] Terry Notary provided motion capture for Groot, and said the character is \"coming of age, so you'll see the teenager find a mentor to look up to and to model himself after\".[49]\nBradley Cooper as Rocket:\nA member of the Guardians who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[50] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[51][52]\nGwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:\nStark's fiancée and the CEO of Stark Industries.[53] Downey felt that \"Pepper remains the heart of the [Iron Man] story\", which was not a focal point in some of the preceding films with Stark. Downey continued that \"we wanted to get back to that reality. Not just for them, but let's really see how that can add to the something-worth-fighting-for of it all\".[9]\nBenicio del Toro as Taneleer Tivan / The Collector: One of the Elders of the Universe who is an obsessive keeper of the largest collection of interstellar fauna, relics, and species of all manner in the galaxy.[54]\nJosh Brolin as Thanos:\nAn intergalactic warlord from Titan who seeks all six Infinity Stones to destroy half of all life[55][24][56] for the sake of \"re-balanc[ing] the universe\".[57] Producer Kevin Feige added that Thanos believes the universe is becoming over-populated, which led to the destruction of his home moon Titan and is something he vowed not to let happen again,[56] and also said \"you could almost go so far as to say he is the main character of\" the film.[58] McFeely shared this sentiment, describing the film as his \"hero journey\" in addition to being the film's protagonist, stating, \"Part of that is the things that [mean] the most to him. We wanted to show that. It wasn't just power; it wasn't just an ideal; it was people\".[26] Brolin likened Thanos to \"the Quasimodo of this time\" and the novel Perfume, since Thanos was born deformed and considered a \"freak\" on Titan,[59] while Joe Russo would reference The Godfather (1972) for Brolin at times, which Brolin felt helped \"to emotionalize the whole thing\".[60] Brolin further added that he preferred playing Thanos over Cable in Deadpool 2 (2018) because of the amount of work that went into creating the character.[61] Thanos does not wear armor for most of the film, which is symbolic of his growing power as he collects the Infinity Stones.[62] In addition to voicing for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[63]\nChris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord:\nThe half-human, half-Celestial leader of the Guardians who was abducted from Earth as a child and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers.[33] Pratt described his role in the film as a \"guest star\" appearance and said \"you get to be a little more vibrant; a little more irreverent; a little bit more colorful if you want it to be\".[64]\n\nAdditionally, several other actors reprise their MCU roles: Danai Gurira as Okoye, the head of the Dora Milaje;[65] Letitia Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri;[66] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, the U.S. Secretary of State;[67] Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.;[68] Winston Duke as M'Baku, the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe the Jabari; Florence Kasumba as Ayo, a member of the Dora Milaje;[69] Jacob Batalon as Parker's friend Ned;[70] Isabella Amara as Parker's classmate Sally;[71] Tiffany Espensen as Parker's classmate Cindy; and Ethan Dizon as Parker's classmate Tiny.[72] Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders make uncredited cameos as Nick Fury and Maria Hill, the former director and deputy director of S.H.I.E.L.D., respectively, in the film's post-credits scene.[73]\n\nThanos' henchmen, known collectively in the comics as the Black Order and in the film as the \"Children of Thanos\",[74] include Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[75][76] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[77][78] Carrie Coon as Proxima Midnight,[76] and Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive.[79] The foursome provided voices and motion-capture performances on set for their characters.[80][79] As Coon was pregnant during filming, she mainly did facial capture for Proxima Midnight with some motion-capture,[81] with stuntwoman Monique Ganderton standing-in and providing the rest on set.[72] Ebony Maw's look was inspired by the Marvel Comics character Mephisto, who appeared in the Infinity Gauntlet storyline.[82]\n\nRoss Marquand voices Johann Schmidt / Red Skull, the \"Stonekeeper\" and former Nazi commander of Hydra during World War II.[40][83][84] Marquand replaces Hugo Weaving, who had expressed reluctance to reprise the character from Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).[40][83] Red Skull was created through CGI and portrayed with stand-ins on set.[84] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as Parker's school bus driver,[40] while screenwriter Stephen McFeely cameos as Secretary Ross' aide.[85] Kenneth Branagh, the director of Thor (2011), voices an Asgardian distress caller in an uncredited cameo.[86] David Cross was invited to make a cameo appearance as Tobias Fünke, his character from the television sitcom Arrested Development, which the Russo brothers had previously worked on; this was prevented by a scheduling conflict, but Fünke still appears in the film as a specimen in the Collector's collection, played by an uncredited extra.[87] Executive producer Jon Favreau was to reprise his role as Happy Hogan, while co-director Joe Russo had a cameo appearance as a paparazzi photographer, but this scene did not make the theatrical cut of the film.[88]\n\nProduction\nMain article: Production of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame\n\nIn October 2014, Marvel Studios announced a two-part sequel to Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) entitled Avengers: Infinity War. Part 1 was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with Part 2 scheduled for May 3, 2019.[89] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of Infinity War back-to-back.[90] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired to direct the films in April 2015.[91] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film,[92] which drew inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 The Infinity Gauntlet comic and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 Infinity comic.[93] Anthony Russo added the film was inspired by 1990s heist films, with Thanos \"on a smash-and-grab\" to acquire all of the Infinity Stones.[56] Producer Kevin Feige said the films would be \"two distinct\" projects with shared elements, not one story split across two films.[94] The Russos decided to rename them to remove this misconception in May 2016,[95] and Marvel simply shortened the first film to Avengers: Infinity War that July.[96]\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 23, 2017,[97] under the working title Mary Lou,[98] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[99] with Trent Opaloch as director of photography.[100] Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[101] In early February, Marvel confirmed the involvement of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the film.[8] Additional filming took place in Scotland beginning in February 2017. The filming occurred in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the Scottish Highlands,[102] with studio work taking place at Wardpark Studios in Cumbernauld.[103] In late June 2017, filming occurred in Downtown Atlanta,[104] as well as Atlanta's Central Park in early July,[105] before moving to Queens, New York in the middle of the month.[106] Filming concluded on July 14, 2017.[107] For the film's final scene, where Thanos settles in a nipa hut, the filmmakers worked with Thailand-based studio Indochina Productions to acquire footage of the Banaue Rice Terraces at Ifugao, Philippines.[108]\n\nLater in July 2017, Joe Russo stated there were a couple of unfinished scenes for Infinity War that would be shot \"in the next few months\".[109] In early March 2018, Disney moved the release of Infinity War in the United States to April 27, 2018, to have it be released the same weekend as some of its international markets.[110][111] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic,[112] Framestore,[113] Method Studios,[114] Weta Digital, DNEG, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, and Perception.[115] With an estimated budget in the range of $325–400 million,[2][3] it is one of the most expensive films ever made.[116] Evans and Hemsworth both earned $15 million for the film.[117]\n\nMusic\nMain article: Avengers: Infinity War (soundtrack)\n\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for The Avengers (2012), was revealed to be returning to score both Infinity War and Endgame.[118] Silvestri recorded his score from January 2018[119] to late March, and found working on the film to be \"a really different experience than anything I'd done before, especially in regard to the approach and balancing quick shifts in tone\".[120] Ludwig Göransson's theme from Black Panther is used in the film.[121] Hollywood Records and Marvel Music released regular and deluxe soundtrack albums digitally on April 27, 2018, with physical releases on May 18. The deluxe edition featured some extended and additional tracks.[122]\n\nMarketing\nFrom left to right: Kevin Feige, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Chadwick Boseman, and Mark Ruffalo at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con\n\nIn May 2017, Robert Downey Jr. and his philanthropic organization Random Act Funding partnered with Omaze for a contest in which a randomly chosen winner from those that donated would receive an Infinity War set visit.[123] A life-sized statue of Thanos, created by Legacy Effects, was on display at D23 Expo 2017,[124] alongside statues of the Black Order / \"Children of Thanos\": Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, and Cull Obsidian.[74] Additionally, Feige, Joe Russo, Downey, Brolin, Bettany, Olsen, Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, Cheadle, Mackie, Cumberbatch, Stan, Holland, Boseman, Ruffalo, and Hemsworth appeared at D23 Expo to present a clip highlighting the 10 years of MCU films, along with footage from Infinity War.[28] The footage, which was screened exclusively for the panel,[125] received strong audience reaction, with fans \"literally on their feet and jumping as the footage played\".[125][126] Julia Alexander of Polygon said there was \"quite a bit happening\" in the footage and it \"finally feels like Marvel has made the movie it always wanted to—and the one we've always wanted to see.\"[126] CinemaBlend's Eric Eisenberg said the footage left him \"literally shaking\", with the film looking \"like it could be one of the most epic blockbusters ever created\".[127] Haleigh Foutch for Collider described it as \"dark and dramatic, and utterly epic. It's clear Marvel is trying to do something different here [...] to pay off a decade's worth of narrative and world-building. While it's impossible to tell from two minutes work of footage, it certainly looks like that gamble paid off\".[128] The D23 footage was also shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con.[129] After the two convention presentations, Avengers: Infinity War generated over 90,000 new conversations on social media from July 17 to 23, the third-most during that time period behind Thor: Ragnarok and Justice League (2017), according to Comscore and its PreAct service.[130] Infinity War stayed in third the following week, with over 41,000 new social media conversations, behind Ragnarok and It (2017).[131] By the week of October 16, Infinity War had generated over 679,000 total social media conversations.[132]\n\nTo promote the film's first teaser trailer, Marvel released a compilation video of some of its previous trailers since Iron Man (2008), \"paired with fan reaction videos to those trailers\".[133] The first teaser for Avengers: Infinity War debuted on Good Morning America on November 29, 2017.[134] Josh Spiegel of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"The most important part of the trailer is how it carefully, deliberately introduces the notion that the Infinity War films are going to function as a passing of the torch, from one set of Avengers to a newer group\".[135] Scott Mendelson, writing for Forbes, noted that even though the trailer was not much different from the convention footage screened earlier in the year, it was \"damn impressive.\" Additionally, the trailer had an \"excellent effect\", using the \"Avengers Initiative speech\" by Nick Fury and the \"Avengers theme\" by Alan Silvestri from The Avengers.[136] Conversely to Mendelson, Alexander commented on the different marketing strategy for the film between the convention footage scenes and the trailer scenes, feeling the \"two couldn't be more different\". She said the convention footage (intended to please the crowd who were \"jittery with anticipation\") was released between Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Thor: Ragnarok, and heavily focused Thor and the Guardians, while the trailer (designed to explain the film to general audiences) heavily features Black Panther and Wakanda, which Alexander said could not have been done before the additional marketing for Black Panther that happened after the conventions provided additional context.[137] Gael Cooper of CNET observed that the trailer was viewed nearly 500,000 times in its first 15 minutes after it was posted on YouTube, but questioned if the trailer broke the site after the view counter appeared to be stuck at 467,331.[138] The trailer was viewed 230 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of It.[139]\n\nIn January 2018, Marvel Comics published a two-issue prequel comic titled Avengers: Infinity War Prelude, which serves as a bridge between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War.[140] A commercial for Infinity War aired during Super Bowl LII, and generated the most social media buzz of all the films advertised according to comScore and United Talent Agency; it was viewed 17.6 million times across YouTube and Facebook.[141] On February 27, Disney and Marvel announced the \"Marvel: The Universe Unites\" charity campaign leading to the release of merchandise for the film on March 3. The week-long event saw stars from the film create social media challenges to provide funds and raise awareness for charities that support children and families impacted by serious illness. Marvel planned to make a $250,000 donation to Starlight Children's Foundation if these posts collectively reached 1 million likes, while Disney planned to donate 10% of all Marvel's Disney Store sales in the United States and online on the weekend of March 3 to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, up to $50,000. Hasbro and Funko each donated $1 million worth of cash and products, to Give Kids the World Village and Starlight Children's Foundation, respectively.[142]\n\nA second trailer was released on March 16, which earned over 1 million views on YouTube in less than three hours after it was released.[143] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post was not overly enthused about another superhero film having \"special-effects-heavy villains, or the sight of yet another mysterious object hanging over the Manhattan skyline\", but felt the trailer made her realize \"that I'm actually looking forward to seeing [the characters of the MCU] get to know each other\".[144] Spiegel agreed with Rosenberg about the potential for character interactions, but felt it was \"gimmicky\" to have so many \"crossover-style introductions or combinations of heroes in a movie like this\".[145] The second trailer was viewed 179 million times in the first 24 hours, the third-most viewed trailer in that time period, behind the first trailer for the film and It, while also becoming the biggest release for a second trailer, surpassing Beauty and the Beast (2017) (128 million views).[146] A week before the film's release, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was lit up each night for the film, counting down to its release.[147] Marvel also featured tie-in events across seven of their mobile games to promote the film.[148] In early May, Marvel and Epic Games announced the \"Infinity Gauntlet Limited Time Mashup\" mode for Fortnite Battle Royale, where players could find the Infinity Gauntlet hidden on the game map and become Thanos with added abilities. The Russo brothers were fans of Fortnite and approached Donald Mustard, the worldwide creative director of Epic Games, about the potential for a crossover between the properties.[149] On November 20, Little, Brown and Company published Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War: Thanos – Titan Consumed, written by Barry Lyga. Despite not existing within Marvel Studios' MCU canon, the novel explores the origins of Thanos before the events of the film. Lyga spoke with Marvel Studios to get an \"outline of who Thanos is and what he means to the movies\", and \"was given great latitude and a free hand [in some areas of the story], while in others I had to tip-toe very carefully through the MCU\".[150]\n\nAll-in-all, the studio spent an estimated $150 million on prints and advertisements promoting the film.[2] Additional marketing partners for the film included Coca-Cola, Quicken Loans and their Rocket Mortgage service, the Infiniti QX50 (which appears in the film), Ziploc, Go-Gurt, Yoplait, Synchrony Bank, American Airlines, and Stand Up to Cancer. The partners created television commercials \"inspired by or featuring the film's characters and themes\", interactive digital initiatives, and robust in-store presences at numerous retailers. Duracell, Unilever, Quaker Oats Company, Chevron, and Samsung ran promotions in smaller markets. Coca-Cola, Ziploc, Go-Gurt, and Yoplait created special packaging in support of the film, with Synchrony implementing a \"Save Like a Hero\" campaign, and Stand Up to Cancer and American Airlines launching a national campaign with a PSA starring Johansson and Hemsworth. In the United Kingdom, OnePlus released an Infinity War edition for one of their smartphones. Deadline Hollywood estimated the media value was $150 million, the largest for any Marvel film, with Coca-Cola contributing an estimated $40 million.[151]\n\nRelease\nTheatrical\n\nAvengers: Infinity War held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 23, 2018, screening also at the adjacent El Capitan Theatre and Grauman's Chinese Theatre.[152][153] It was released in most countries worldwide, including the United States, on April 27, with a few debuts beginning as early as April 25,[110] and was shown in IMAX and 3D on select screens.[154][155] In the United States, the film opened in 4,474 theaters, 408 of which were IMAX; this was the widest release for a Disney title ever and the second-widest ever after Despicable Me 3's (2017) 4,529 theaters. Three of AMC Theatres' locations screened the film for 24 hours straight, with 53 of their locations having showtimes at either 2 am or 3 am to accommodate demand.[156] In India, the film had the biggest release ever for a Hollywood film, opening on nearly 2,000 screens in four languages.[157] The film also screened in 515 4DX theaters in 59 countries.[158] Avengers: Infinity War was originally scheduled to be released on May 4 in the United States.[89] The Chinese release of the film, which opened on May 11,[159] was originally scheduled to end on June 10, but was granted a \"rare\" extension of 30 days, to end on July 9.[160] Avengers: Infinity War is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[161]\n\nSelect footage from the film was screened in various cities during the film's press tour in early April, ahead of the Los Angeles premiere. The Russos said only a limited amount of the film would be shown at these screenings to reduce the chance of spoilers being leaked. Adam Chitwood of Collider commented that this was \"highly unusual as most Marvel movies are screened in their entirety for press about a month before they hit theaters\".[162] Ahead of the United States release, AMC Theatres in New York City and Orlando, Florida aired an eleven-MCU film marathon beginning on April 25, ending in a screening of Infinity War. The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles had a similar marathon for the film's release.[163]\n\nHome media\n\nAvengers: Infinity War was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 31, 2018, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 14. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. The digital release also features a roundtable discussion between MCU directors the Russos, Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, James Gunn, Ryan Coogler, Peyton Reed, and Taika Waititi.[164] In terms of home media sales, the physical versions of the film were collectively the top home media release of the week in which they were first released.[165]\n\nDespite being shot with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release did not present the film in that aspect ratio, instead including a cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[166][167] Joe Russo said they \"spent a long time trying to\" have the IMAX version on the home media, but since the IMAX Corporation has \"agency over that format\", the situation was \"complicated\".[168] He did not rule out the possibility that this version could be available at a later point.[167] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[169]\n\nReception\nBox office\nMain article: List of box office records set by Avengers: Infinity War\n\nAvengers: Infinity War grossed $678.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.374 billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.052 billion,[4] becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time,[170][171] the highest-grossing film of 2018,[172] the highest-grossing MCU film, and the highest-grossing superhero film.[173]\n\nIts worldwide opening weekend of $640.5 million was the biggest of all time, beating The Fate of the Furious's (2017) $541.9 million.[156] It was later beat by its sequel, Avengers: Endgame, which grossed $1.222 billion in its opening weekend.[174] It was the fastest film to make $1 billion at the worldwide box office, doing so in 11 days to eclipse Star Wars: The Force Awakens's (2015) record of 12 days.[175] Also, in its second weekend, Infinity War passed $13.5 million from 4DX screens, which was the all-time record for the format.[158] On June 12, 2018, Infinity War passed the $2 billion mark at the worldwide box office, becoming the fourth film to cross that milestone after Avatar (2009), Titanic (1997), and The Force Awakens.[171] Crossing the mark in 48 days, it was the second-fastest to that point, after Avatar's 47-day record and later the 11-day record of Endgame.[176] With $140 million worldwide from IMAX,[177] the film is the third-largest worldwide in the format, behind Avatar and The Force Awakens,[170] and the largest for a Marvel film.[178] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $500 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2018's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[2]\n\nPre-sale ticket records\n\nIn December 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that Infinity War was the most anticipated film of 2018.[179] Fandango later reported that Infinity War achieved the largest initial 24-hour ticket pre-sales for a superhero film, taking just 6 hours to surpass the previous 24-hour record set by Black Panther. Atom Tickets reported that Infinity War sold more tickets in its first pre-sales day than Black Panther sold in its first month.[180] Within 72 hours, the film generated the largest pre-sales for any superhero film at AMC Theatres, with its advance ticket sales being 257.6% ahead of Black Panther's, 751.5% ahead of Captain America: Civil War, and 1,106.5% ahead of Avengers: Age of Ultron during the same time frame.[181] Two weeks before its release, Fandango revealed that advance ticket sales for Infinity War were outpacing the last seven MCU films combined in the same timeframe, and had become the company's top April release. It was also on pace to become the top superhero film.[182] A week before the film released, The Wall Street Journal said the film had sold more than $50 million worth of advance tickets, behind only The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017),[183][156] with Fandango reporting that more than 2,500 showtimes had sold out. On Atom Tickets, Infinity War had the most pre-sale volume, selling 7% higher than The Last Jedi and 250% higher than Black Panther at the same point in their sales. Atom also reported that ticket sales for Infinity War were doubling daily the week of its release, the fastest rate of increase the service has seen for any MCU title.[156]\n\nUnited States and Canada\n\nAvengers: Infinity War earned $106.7 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $39 million from Thursday night previews), for an opening weekend total of $258.2 million. The Thursday night preview earning was the best for an MCU film (beating Avengers: Age of Ultron's $27.6 million) and the fourth-best of all time, behind The Force Awakens ($57 million), The Last Jedi ($45 million), and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011) ($43.5 million).

The total weekend gross became the highest-grossing opening weekend, beating The Force Awakens's $248 million. IMAX contributed $22.5 million to the opening weekend gross, which was the best opening for a Marvel film in the format and the third-biggest opening, behind The Force Awakens ($30 million) and The Last Jedi ($24.7 million). AMC reported that the film had the highest Friday and Saturday box office gross for a single title in the company's history, while Fandango reported that approximately $84 million worth of tickets were sold through the service, approximately 30%, which was the largest share of the weekend box office for any film in the company's history.[156] Avengers: Infinity War earned an additional $25 million the Monday after its opening weekend, which was the highest-grossing Monday in April, beating Furious 7 (2015) ($14 million), and the second-best Monday gross for an MCU film, after Black Panther ($40.1 million).[184] The next day, it earned $23.5 million, which was the highest-grossing Tuesday for an MCU film, beating Black Panther ($20.8 million), and the highest-grossing Tuesday in May, beating The Avengers ($17.6 million). It also tied The Force Awakens for the fastest to reach $300 million at five days.[185]\n\nThe film remained number one in its second weekend, earning $115.5 million, which was the second-best second weekend ever after The Force Awakens ($149.2 million).

The weekend also saw its total domestic IMAX gross become $48.1 million, which was the highest for any MCU film.[173] The film's fourth weekend saw it come in second, behind Deadpool 2,[186] and in its fifth it finished third behind Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) and Deadpool 2.[187] By May 23, Infinity War surpassed $600 million, becoming the second-fastest film to do so in 26 days, after The Force Awakens (12 days).[188] It remained in the top ten through its ninth weekend.[189] In the United States and Canada, it went on to become the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time,[171] and the second-highest-grossing superhero film, behind Black Panther.[190]\n\nOther territories\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film earned $382.7 million from 52 markets, opening number one in all, and became the number two opening internationally, behind The Fate of the Furious ($444.2 million). IMAX contributed $18.5 million, which was the best opening outside of the US, Canada, and China, surpassing The Force Awakens ($17.5 million).[191] All-time opening weekend records were set in South Korea ($39.2 million), Mexico ($25.4 million), Brazil ($19.1 million), India (for a Western release, $18.6 million), the Philippines ($12.5 million), Thailand ($10 million), Indonesia ($9.6 million), Malaysia,[191] Hong Kong, Vietnam,[192] Central America, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and West Africa,[191] with many also setting opening day records.[193] France had the biggest superhero opening in the market with $17.7 million,[191] as did Denmark, Finland, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. The United Kingdom earned $8.9 million, which was the biggest MCU opening day and third-highest opening day for a Disney film;[192] it would go on to earn $41.4 million for the weekend, which was the third-highest of all time and the second-highest Disney opening.[191] Argentina had the second-highest opening day of all time, while Germany had the best superhero film opening day of all time,[192] ultimately earning $14.7 million, which was the best superhero opening ever.[191] Many other European countries and the Middle East also broke superhero film records.[192] Japan had the second-biggest opening for an MCU film with $9 million, and Australia had the second-highest opening weekend ever, with $23.2 million.[191]\n\nAvengers: Infinity War remained number one in its 54 markets in its second weekend.[159] The $4.9 million opening day in Russia was the biggest of all time. However, there was some controversy with the film's release in that country. Originally, the Russian government ordered it to be released on May 11, but after a scandal the government made concessions and agreed to let it premiere on May 3 with a condition that on May 9, during the Victory Day, only Russian films would be played in the cinema theatres.[194] Infinity War was also the first film in Russia to sell more than 1 million tickets in a single day,[195] and went on to gross $17.6 million in the market, a new opening weekend record. IMAX contributed $2.2 million in the market, which was also an opening weekend record.[159] In its third weekend, the film remained number one in a majority of its markets. Infinity War opened in China to $200 million (RMB 1.266 billion), which was the second-highest opening weekend in local currency behind The Fate of the Furious ($184 million and RMB 1.352 million). IMAX contributed $20.5 million, which was the third-largest opening in China.[178] Infinity War also broke China's pre-sale record of 400 million yuan ($63 million).[196] In India, Infinity War became the first Hollywood film to earn over ₹2 billion net ($29.7 million),[197] and also became the highest-grossing MCU film in the United Kingdom.[198] In its sixth weekend, the film became the highest-grossing MCU film in Japan with $33 million.[199]\n\nThe film became the highest-grossing release ever in Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines, Central America, Bolivia, Venezuela, Latin America as a region, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Malaysia, Singapore, India (for a Western release), Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand (for a Western release), and Mongolia,[159][178][170][177] the second-highest in the Asia-Pacific region (for a Western release), Hong Kong, and South Korea (for a Western release), and the third-highest in China (for a Western release). It is also the highest-grossing superhero film in many European countries, including the United Kingdom.[177] As of June 17, 2018, the film's top markets are China ($373.4 million), the United Kingdom ($95.7 million), and South Korea ($92.8 million).[200] The film is the third-highest-grossing film of all time in territories outside the United States and Canada.[171]\n\nCritical response\nJosh Brolin's performance as Thanos was praised by many critics.[201]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 85%, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 492 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Avengers: Infinity War ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions.\"[202] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100 based on 54 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[203]\n\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the writers' and directors' ability to balance the large cast of characters, saying they, \"under the supervision of Marvel Films maestro Kevin Feige, acknowledge the traffic jam of egos and play it for laughs\".[204] Owen Gleiberman of Variety concurred, stating, \"Infinity War is a brashly entertaining jamboree, structured to show off each hero or heroine and give them just enough to do, and to update their mythologies without making it all feel like homework\".[205] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers said the film is \"too much of a good thing\" and wrote, \"The Russo brothers have clearly never learned the concept that less is more. They've used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs that won't quit\".[206] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called it Marvel's \"biggest and most ambitious movie yet\", but concluded \"it's certainly not the best. However, there's plenty of action, humor and heart—and some genuinely effective dramatic moments\". Roeper went on to praise the film's cast and Josh Brolin in particular, whom he called \"the film's most interesting performance\".[207] Gleiberman called Brolin's motion capture performance \"supremely effective\" and said, \"Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal\".[205] McCarthy wrote, \"Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain\".[204] Gleiberman also praised the film's action sequences, saying \"Infinity War brims with tensely spectacular combat sequences, even if the question of who's going to win each one has that extravagantly arbitrary could-Mighty-Mouse-beat-up-Superman? quality\".[205] McCarthy called the scale of the action \"astonishing\",[204] and Travers wrote, \"Avengers: Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes\".[206] Josh Spiegel, also of The Hollywood Reporter, said the film takes \"a cue from the ending of The Empire Strikes Back in its super-sized finale; this is the equivalent of Han Solo frozen in the carbonite, on steroids\".[208]\n\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times criticized the film's reliance on other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"Considered on its own, as a single, nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie, Avengers: Infinity War makes very little sense\", but conceded that it \"was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation\".[209] Richard Brody of The New Yorker agreed, stating, \"The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\".[210] Stephanie Zacharek of Time said, \"[It] isn't really a beginning, but more of a middle or an end with a new piece of yarn attached. You need to have seen and internalized every one of the previous 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to fully get it\".[211] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called it a \"brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close\", but called its ultimate bid for catharsis \"unsuccessful\" since the Marvel \"assembly line [is not stopped] from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency\".[212] Scott also criticized the action sequences, calling them \"tedious and predictable\" and \"surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination\".[209] Likewise, Zacharek said, \"There's no pacing in Avengers: Infinity War. It's all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time\".[211]\n\nAudience response\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,[156] and those at PostTrak gave the film an 87% overall positive score and a 68% \"definite recommend\".[158] American YouTube personality Tony \"Nem\" Mitchell watched the film 103 times in theaters, a world record. When Mitchell's streak was gaining media awareness around his 44th viewing, he noted that IMAX reached out to give him 50 free tickets to continue the streak, and the Russo brothers invited him to Endgame's premiere.[213][214][215] Mitchell said this was the way he \"want[ed] to support Marvel and the Russo brothers\".[213] Seventeen-year-old Kieran Harvey from Staffordshire also watched the film in theaters 100 times. Harvey stated that he \"didn't plan on seeing it this many times it just sort of happened\" adding that Infinity War \"just felt so different to anything I've ever seen before, and I just love it so much so have been going as much as I can!\"[216]\n\nThe ending of the film sparked various Internet meme reactions,[217] including one referencing Spider-Man saying he does not feel good as he disintegrates, which was applied to other things.[218] The website, DidThanosKill.Me was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not.[219] The ending also spawned the creation of the Reddit subreddit, /r/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible. Once the administrators agreed to the random ban of half the subscribers, it was set to occur on July 9, 2018.[220] Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit's subscribers increase to over 700,000,[221] including both of the Russos who subscribed.[222] Ahead of the ban, Brolin posted a video saying \"Here we go, Reddit users,\" and ending it with a snap.[223] Over 60,000 people watched a live Twitch stream of the ban occurring, which lasted several hours.[221] The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history.[221][224] Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit, /r/inthesoulstone.[220][221] One Reddit user who participated described the ban as embodying \"the spirit of the Internet\" with people \"banding together, en masse, around something relatively meaningless but somehow decidedly awesome and hilarious\".[224] Andrew Tigani of Screen Rant said this showed \"how impactful the film has already become to pop culture. It is also a testament to how valuable fan interaction can be via social media\".[223]\n\nAccolades\nMain article: List of accolades received by Avengers: Infinity War\n\nAt the 91st Academy Awards, Avengers: Infinity War received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[225] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award,[226] a British Academy Film Award,[227] and two Critics' Choice Awards,[228] among others. In 2020, Infinity War was ranked seventh in an Empire magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[229]\n\nSequel\nMain article: Avengers: Endgame\nFurther information: List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films\n\nAvengers: Endgame was released on April 26, 2019,[230] with the Russos returning to direct,[91] and Markus and McFeely once again writing the screenplay.[92]\n\nSee also\n\"What If...

It is the second Spider-Man film reboot and the 16th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts from a screenplay by the writing teams of Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Tyne Daly, Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. In the film, Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the Vulture (Keaton).\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the film rights for Spider-Man, integrating the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character, and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. Principal photography began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 28, 2017, and was released in the United States on July 7, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. Homecoming grossed over $880 million worldwide, becoming the second-most-successful Spider-Man film and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2017. It received praise for the light tone, its focus on Parker's high school life, and the performances, particularly of Holland and Keaton. Two sequels have been released: Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). A new trilogy of live-action films from Sony and Marvel Studios is in development.\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nFollowing the Battle of New York in 2012,[a] Adrian Toomes and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of Damage Control (DODC), a partnership between Tony Stark and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the Chitauri technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons, including a flying Vulture suit Toomes uses to steal Chitauri power cells.\n\nEight years later,[b] after being drafted into the Avengers by Stark to help with an internal dispute in Germany,[c] Peter Parker resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full-time Avenger. Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. His best friend, Ned, eventually discovers his secret identity.\n\nParker comes across Toomes's associates Jackson Brice / Shocker and Herman Schultz selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes in the Vulture suit and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.\n\nParker and Ned study a weapon Brice left behind, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a DODC truck but is trapped inside, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, he races to the Washington Monument, where the core is activated and explodes, trapping Ned and their friends in an elevator. Parker saves them, including his classmate and crush Liz. Days later, in New York City, aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures Toomes's new buyer Mac Gargan but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers, but confiscates his suit as punishment for his recklessness.\n\nParker returns to his high school life and asks Liz to go to the homecoming dance with him. On the night of the dance, he discovers that Toomes is Liz's father. Deducing Parker's secret identity, Toomes threatens him. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a DODC plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters in Upstate New York. He leaves the dance and dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit. Though he is ambushed outside by Schultz, he defeats him with Ned's help. He races to Toomes's lair, where Toomes attacks Parker, destroying the building's support columns, and leaves Parker to die, trapped in the rubble of the collapsed building. Gaining the motivation from his inner strength, Parker escapes and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach at Coney Island. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes's life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes. Parker leaves Toomes for the police along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away. Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full time, and Stark proposes to Pepper Potts. Stark also returns the Spider-Man suit to Parker, who puts it on just as his aunt May walks in.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes in prison, saying he has heard that the latter knows Spider-Man's real identity, though Toomes denies this.\n\nCast[edit]\n(L–R) Tom Holland, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Jacob Batalon, Zendaya, and director Jon Watts promoting Spider-Man: Homecoming at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con\nTom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:\nA 15-year-old who gained spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[9] Producers Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal were impressed by Holland's performances in The Impossible (2012), Wolf Hall (2015), and In the Heart of the Sea (2015).[10] Holland took inspiration from previous Spider-Man actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield but also hoped to deliver something \"new and exciting\" with his take on the character,[11] the first to focus on Parker as \"dealing with everyday problems that a 15-year-old deals with as well as trying to save the city\".[12] Holland attended the Bronx High School of Science in the Bronx for a few days to prepare for the role,[13] where other students did not believe he was cast as Spider-Man. Holland felt this would carry over well to the film, where other characters do not suspect Parker of being Spider-Man.[14] It took 25 to 45 minutes for Holland to get into costume, depending on if he had to wear a stunt harness underneath the suit.[13] Holland initially signed for six MCU films, including three Spider-Man films.[15]\nMichael Keaton as Adrian Toomes / Vulture:\nA salvager-turned-arms-trafficker after his company is forced out of business. He uses a suit with mechanical wings forged from Chitauri technology.[16] Toomes is revealed to be the father of Liz, Parker's love interest.[17] Director Jon Watts wanted him to be a \"regular guy\", closer to John C. Reilly's Nova Corpsman Rhomann Dey from Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) than other MCU villains like Thanos and Ultron, to go with Spider-Man as a \"regular kid who becomes a superhero\".[16][18] This helped avoid Toomes drawing the attention of the Avengers, and provided someone that Parker would be able to defeat while still learning to use his abilities.[19] Keaton said Toomes was not completely villainous, as \"there's parts of him that you go, 'You know what? I might see his point.'\"[20] Co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll likened Toomes to \"the dark Tony Stark\",[16] a \"businessman with a family. He wants to look out for his kids ... He doesn't have these big delusions of grandeur where he wants to take over the world, or replace the government, or even defeat the Avengers or anything. He just wants his shot at the good life.\"[21] Keaton was not hesitant to portray another comic book character after playing Batman in Tim Burton's 1989 film and its 1992 sequel.[20]\nJon Favreau as Happy Hogan:\nThe former head of security for Stark Industries and Tony Stark's driver and bodyguard.[22] Hogan is \"looking after\" Parker in the film, with Favreau saying that Parker \"needs someone to help him out\".[23] Favreau previously portrayed Hogan in the Iron Man films, having also directed the first two of those, and described returning as just an actor as fun, allowing him \"to maintain the relationship with the MCU ... Especially when the filmmakers are taking care of you, and taking care of the characters and the story.\"[24]\nGwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts: Tony Stark's fiancée and the CEO of Stark Industries.[25]\nZendaya as Michelle:\nOne of Parker's classmates, also known as \"MJ\".[26][27] Zendaya, calling her awkward but intellectual, said that \"she just feels like she doesn't need to talk to people\" because of her intelligence.[28] She added that it was \"refreshing\" that Michelle was weird and different, feeling that \"a lot of young people—especially young women—can relate to that.\"[29] Watts likened the character to Ally Sheedy's Allison Reynolds from The Breakfast Club (1985) or Linda Cardellini's Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks (1999–2000).[21] The character is not a direct adaptation of Mary Jane Watson, but was given the initials \"MJ\" to \"remind you of that dynamic\",[30] with the writers \"plant[ing] the seeds in this movie\" for comparisons to Watson, but also making her \"wholly different\".[31] Feige added that Michelle is \"not obsessed with\" Parker like Watson is at times in the comics, \"she's just observant\".[30] Her full name, Michelle Jones-Watson, was revealed in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021).[32]\nDonald Glover as Aaron Davis:\nA criminal looking to purchase weapons from Toomes.[33][34] Davis is the uncle of Miles Morales, an inheritor of the Spider-Man mantle, in the comics. Glover voiced Morales in the Ultimate Spider-Man television series, and campaigned to portray Spider-Man in a film in 2010. Watts was aware of the campaign, and as soon as he was hired he asked Feige about casting Glover. The role was designed as \"a surprise treat for fans\", with Davis mentioning his nephew to set up Morales potentially appearing in a future MCU film.[34] Watts insisted Glover accept the part, assuring him that if he declined the offer, he would have scrapped Davis from the film.[35]\nJacob Batalon as Ned:\nParker's best friend,[26][36][37] who is a \"complete gamer\".[38] Batalon described him as \"the quintessential best guy, the best man, the number two guy, the guy in the chair\" for Parker.[39] Marvel used Ned Leeds as a basis for the character, who does not have a last name in the script or film, but essentially created their own character with him. Carroll said that Ned and other characters in the film are composites of several of their favorites from Spider-Man comics,[37] notably Ganke Lee, who is Miles Morales' best friend in Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man.[40] He is given the last name \"Leeds\" in the sequel Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019),[41] which was confirmed in No Way Home.[32]\nLaura Harrier as Liz: A senior, Parker's love interest, and Toomes's daughter,[42][43] with a \"type-A\" personality.[21]\nTony Revolori as Flash:\nParker's rival and classmate.[43][44] It was noted that the character is generally depicted as a white bully in the comics; the Guatemalan American actor received death threats upon his casting.[43][45] Revolori worked hard \"to do him justice\", as he is an important character to the fans.[43] Rather than being a physically imposing jock, Flash Thompson was reimagined as \"a rich, smug kid\" to reflect modern views of bullying,[46] by crafting him more into a social media bully and rival for Parker opposed to a jock;[45] this depiction was largely informed by Holland's visit to the Bronx High School of Science.[13] Revolori said that Flash has to work hard to match Parker's intelligence, which is \"one of the reasons he doesn't like Peter. Everyone else seems to like Peter, so he's like, why don't they like me like they like him?\" Revolori gained 60 lb (27 kg) for the role.[45]\nBokeem Woodbine as Herman Schultz / Shocker: An accomplice of Toomes who is the second person to use modified, vibro-blast shooting versions of Brock Rumlow's gauntlets.[47][21]\nTyne Daly as Anne Marie Hoag: The head of the U.S. Department of Damage Control.[48][49]\nMarisa Tomei as May Parker:\nPeter's aunt.[50][51] First reports of Tomei's casting caused backlash on social media, with comic book fans opining that the actress was \"too young and attractive to portray the character\",[52] especially after the character had previously been depicted by actresses older than Tomei. Regarding the casting, Captain America: Civil War (2016) co-writer Stephen McFeely said that, for the MCU, they were trying to make Peter \"as naturalistic as possible...That's partly why his aunt isn't 80 years old; if she's the sister of his dead mother, why does she have to be two generations ahead?\"[53] Carroll added that the creative team was looking for more of a \"big sister\" or someone closer in age to Peter Parker in the casting process.[54] After researching the character, Tomei did make \"a case to age me up, but no they didn't do it\".[55] Tomei felt there was a \"blank slate\" from which she could develop the character, and talked to Watts about May being \"a community organizer or invested in the neighborhood\" to indicate where Peter's values come from.[56]\nRobert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:\nA self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and an Avenger with electromechanical suits of armor of his own invention who is Parker's mentor and the creator of the U.S. Department of Damage Control.[21][57] Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman noted that, beyond the commercial advantage of featuring Downey in the film, the inclusion of Stark was important due to the relationship established between him and Parker in Captain America: Civil War.[58] Watts noted that after Stark's actions in Civil War, introducing Parker to life as an Avenger, there are \"a lot of repercussions to that. Is it a first step towards Tony as some sort of mentor figure? Is he comfortable with that?\"[59] Co-writer Jonathan Goldstein compared Stark to Ethan Hawke's father character in Boyhood (2014).[19]\n\nAdditionally, Kerry Condon and Chris Evans reprise their roles as F.R.I.D.A.Y. and Steve Rogers / Captain America from previous MCU films, respectively.[60][61] Rogers appears in public service announcements played at Parker's school.[61] Garcelle Beauvais portrays Doris Toomes, Adrian's wife and Liz's mother,[62][63] and Jennifer Connelly provides the voice of Karen, the A.I. in Parker's suit.[60] Hemky Madera appears as Mr. Delmar, the owner of a local bodega, while Gary Weeks portrays Damage Control agent Foster.[64] Logan Marshall-Green plays Jackson Brice, the first Shocker, who is an accomplice of Toomes who uses modified, vibro-blast shooting versions of Brock Rumlow's gauntlets.[21][65][66] Other business partners of Toomes include: Michael Chernus as Phineas Mason,[16][67] Michael Mando as Mac Gargan,[49][68] and Christopher Berry as Randy Vale.[64][69]\n\nFaculty at Parker's high school include: Kenneth Choi, who previously played Jim Morita in the MCU, as Jim's descendant Principal Morita;[66][70] Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson,[71] the school's gym teacher, who he described as \"one of the dumbass characters that don't realize [Parker is] Spider-Man\";[72][73] Martin Starr, who reprises his previously unnamed role from The Incredible Hulk (2008),[74] as Mr. Harrington,[66] a teacher and academic decathlon coach;[75][76] Selenis Leyva as Ms. Warren;[77][78] Tunde Adebimpe as Mr. Cobbwell;[64] and John Penick as Mr. Hapgood.[79] Parker's classmates include: Isabella Amara as Sally;[80][81] Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Jason Ionello;[80][82] Josie Totah[d] as Seymour;[80][83] Abraham Attah as Abraham;[66][84] Tiffany Espensen as Cindy;[62][85] Angourie Rice as Betty Brant;[86][87] Michael Barbieri as Charles;[82][88][89] and Ethan Dizon as Tiny.[82] Martha Kelly appears in the film as a tour guide,[64][90] Zach Cherry appears as a street vendor who asks Spider-Man to \"do a flip\",[91] and Kirk Thatcher makes a cameo appearance as a \"punk\", an homage to his role in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986).[92] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, as a New York City apartment resident named Gary who witnesses Parker's confrontation with a neighbor.[93][94]\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nSee also: The Amazing Spider-Man 2 § Cancelled sequels and spin-offs\n\nThere are so many things from the comics that haven't been done yet ... stories [that Spider-Man is] in high school for a lot of it. We want to explore that. That also makes him very, very different from any of our other characters in the MCU\n\n—Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios[95]\n\nFollowing the November 2014 hacking of Sony's computers, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released, stating that Sony wanted Marvel Studios to produce a new trilogy of Spider-Man films while Sony retained \"creative control, marketing, and distribution\". Discussions between Sony and Marvel broke down, and Sony planned to proceed with its own slate of Spider-Man films.[96] However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that they would release a new Spider-Man film, with Kevin Feige and Pascal producing (the latter through her company Pascal Pictures).[97][98] The character would first appear in an earlier Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film,[97] later revealed to be Captain America: Civil War (2016).[99] Marvel Studios would explore opportunities to integrate MCU characters into future Spider-Man films, which Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, and have final creative control over.[97] Both studios have the ability to terminate the agreement at any point, and no money was exchanged with the deal. However, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal that gave Marvel full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for a one-time payment of $175 million to Sony and paying up to $35 million for each future Spider-Man film rather than receiving their previous five percent of a Spider-Man film's revenue—Marvel could now reduce their $35 million payment if the co-produced film grossed more than $750 million.[100] Marvel Studios still received five percent of first dollar gross for the film.[101] Lone Star Funds also co-financed the film with Sony, via its LSC Film Corporation deal,[102] covering 25 percent of the $175 million budget,[103] while Columbia Pictures officially served as co-producer with Marvel Studios.[104] Sony also paid Marvel Studios an undisclosed producer fee.[105]\n\nMarvel had been working to add Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe since at least October 2014, when they announced their slate of Phase Three films, with Feige saying, \"Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone. So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [the deal] were to happen with Sony, how it would all shift. We've been thinking about [the Spider-Man film] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three.\"[106] Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, producers for The Amazing Spider-Man series, were set to serve as executive producers,[107] with neither director Marc Webb nor actor Andrew Garfield returning for the new film.[108] Sony was reportedly looking for an actor younger than Garfield to play Spider-Man,[107] with Logan Lerman and Dylan O'Brien considered front-runners.[109] In March 2015, Drew Goddard was being considered to write and direct the film,[110][111] while O'Brien said he had not been approached for the role.[112] Goddard, who was previously attached to a Sony film based on the Sinister Six, later said he declined to work on the new film as he thought he \"didn't really have an idea\" for it and struggled with the idea of working on a new film after spending a year working on the Sinister Six film and being in that mindset.[113] The following month, while promoting Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Feige said the character of Peter Parker would be around 15 to 16 years old in the film,[95] which would not be an origin story, since \"there have been two retellings of that origin in the last [thirteen years, so] we are going to take it for granted that people know that, and the specifics\".[106] Parker's Uncle Ben is still referenced in the film,[114] but not by name.[115] There was some discussion to include a direct reference to Ben when Peter is getting ready for his homecoming by the revelation that his wardrobe consisted of Ben's clothes, but the writers desisted because they felt that the moment veered away from Parker's character arc and made Ben's death feel like a \"throwaway line\".[116] Later in April, Nat Wolff, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Timothée Chalamet, and Liam James were under consideration by Sony and Marvel to play Spider-Man,[117] with Holland and Butterfield as the front-runners.[118] Joseph Quinn and Chandler Riggs also auditioned for the role.[119][120]\n\nIn May 2015, Jonathan Levine, Ted Melfi, Jason Moore, the writing team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, and Jared Hess were being considered to direct the film.[121] Butterfield, Holland, Judah Lewis, Matt Lintz, Charlie Plummer, and Charlie Rowe screen-tested for the lead role against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU, for \"chemistry\".[122][123] The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers—the directors of Captain America: Civil War.[123] Lintz would later be cast as Bruno Carrelli in the Marvel Studios Disney+ series Ms. Marvel (2022).[124] By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein and Jon Watts also in consideration,[125] while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen-testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU and emerged as the favorite.[122] On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man and that Watts would direct the film.[10] The Russos \"were pretty vocal about who [sic] [they] wanted for the part\", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background.[99] Watts was able to read the Civil War script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film.[115] He was able to \"see what they were doing with it\" and provide \"ideas about this and that\",[126] including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like \"so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs\".[115] On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said he was excited to explore the \"ground level\" of the MCU, a world where characters like the Avengers exist but have only been depicted in previous films at \"the Penthouse level of the Marvel world\".[21]\n\nBefore getting the job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early \"mood reels\" saying, \"I don't know what the situation would be, but that would be a person he'd want to get in trouble with.\"[127] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that \"at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death\". He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet,[128] and that filming would begin in June 2016.[129] In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt.[50] It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay,[130] and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch;[131] both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay.[132] The pair had proposed a take on the character that was \"diametrically opposed\" to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a laundry list of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character rather than the \"drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man\". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well.[19] Daley said the film was about Parker \"finding his place\" in the MCU, with the writing team wanting the film to focus on him \"coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses\", such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, \"Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie.\"[17] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as \"the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington, D.C.\" One of the first sequences they pitched was \"seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. ... you're familiar with the sort of areas he's been in, [so] why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven't seen before?\"[19] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, \"low-stakes\" approach than previous films, which avoided having to explain why the Avengers were not helping, since a world-threatening problem would logically require the \"big guys\".[17]\n\nMarvel encouraged Daley and Goldstein to express their own sense of humor in the script, with Daley saying, \"When you're seeing the world through the eyes of a fun, funny kid, you can really embrace that voice, and not give him the cookie-cutter one-liners that you're so accustomed to hearing from Peter Parker.\" Inspired by their experiences working on sitcoms, the writers also looked to create \"a network of strong characters\" to surround Parker with in the film.[19] In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a coming-of-age story to see the growth of Parker, citing Can't Buy Me Love (1987), Say Anything... (1989), and Almost Famous (2000) as some of his favorite films in that genre.[133] It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations.[134] Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and \"came to a new realization\" about the character's original popularity, feeling that he introduced a new perspective to the comics that had already established \"a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person's perspective on it\". He felt that this was also the responsibility of this film since it had to introduce Spider-Man to the already established MCU.[115] Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were Ultimate Spider-Man (2000-2011) and Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane (2004-2009).[134] In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.[135]\n\nPre-production[edit]\nWatts promoting Spider-Man: Homecoming at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con\n\nWatts wanted to heavily pre-visualize the film, especially its action sequences, as he does on all his films. For Homecoming, Watts worked with a team to \"figure out the visual language for the action sequences and ... try stuff out before\" filming began to help Watts practice given his lack of experience working on large-scale films. For the \"web-slinging\" sequences, Watts wanted to avoid the big \"swoopy\" camera moves that had been previously used and instead \"keep it all as grounded as possible. So, whether it was shooting with a drone camera or a helicopter or a cable-cam, or even just handheld, up on a roof chasing after him, I wanted it to feel like we were there with him.\"[134]\n\nIn January 2016, Sony shifted the film's release date from July 28, 2017, to July 7, 2017,[136] and said the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D in post-production.[137] J. K. Simmons expressed interest in reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films.[138] In early March, Zendaya was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker.[51][139] The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear,[140] and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover.[141] He noted that the sharing between the studios was done with \"good faith\" in order \"to have more toys to play with as we put together a story\",[7] and that \"the agreement was that it is very much a Sony Pictures movie... we are the creative producers. We are the ones hiring the actor, introducing him in [Civil War], and then working right now on the script and soon to be shooting.\"[141] Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively to Marvel.[142] At CinemaCon 2016, Sony announced the title of the film to be Spider-Man: Homecoming,[143][144] a reference to the common high school tradition homecoming as well as the character \"coming home\" to Marvel and the MCU.[144] Tony Revolori – who had auditioned for Peter Parker[145] – and Laura Harrier joined the cast as classmates of Parker's,[42][146] and Downey Jr. was revealed to be in the film as Stark.[57][147] Watts noted that Stark \"was always a part of\" the film's story because of his interactions with Parker in Civil War.[134] Downey Jr. was paid $10 million for his involvement.[148]\n\nAlso in April, Michael Keaton entered talks to play a villain,[149] but dropped out of discussions shortly thereafter due to scheduling conflicts with the film The Founder (2016).[150][151] At this point, John Leguizamo was approached to fill the role and entered negotiations to do so.[152] Keaton soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for The Founder,[151][153] which necessitated Marvel to ask Leguizamo if he would step away from the role in order to cast Keaton;[152] Keaton closed the deal in late May.[153] Marvel offered to cast Leguizamo in another role, which he considered \"tiny\" and declined.[152] Mark Hamill was interested in playing the film's villain in case Keaton turned down the offer, but Keaton reconsidered the offer in time.[154] In June, Michael Barbieri was cast as a friend of Parker's,[88][89] Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal,[70] and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character,[65][68] while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles.[33][75] Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as \"one of [the] most diverse places in the world\",[126] with Feige adding that \"we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [With this cast] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue.\"[43] This is also different from the previous films, which were \"set in a lily-white Queens high school\".[155] Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included the Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, \"We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn't want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a Daily Bugle, we want to do it in a way that feels contemporary\".[114] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials \"MJ\" as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is \"to have fun with [references] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic\".[30]\n\nSpider-Man's costume in the film has more technical improvements than the previous suits, including the logo on the chest being a remote drone, an AI system similar to Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S., a holographic interface, a parachute, a tracking device for Stark to track Parker, a heater, an airbag, the ability to light up, and the ability to augment reality with the eyepieces. Stark also builds in a \"training wheels\" protocol, to initially limit Parker's access to all of its features. Carroll noted Marvel went through the comics and \"pull[ed] out all the sort of fun and wacky things the suit did\" to include in the Homecoming suit.[156] Spider-Man's web-shooters have various settings, first teased at the end of Civil War, which Carroll explained allowed him to \"adjust the spray\" to different settings like the spinning web, web ball, or ricochet web. He compared this to a DSLR camera.[114]\n\nFilming[edit]\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 20, 2016,[157] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[158] under the working title Summer of George.[159] Salvatore Totino served as director of photography.[160] Filming also took place in Atlanta, with locations including Grady High School,[161] Downtown Atlanta,[162] the Atlanta Marriott Marquis,[163] Piedmont Park, the Georgia World Congress Center,[164] and the West End neighborhood.[165] Holland said building New York sets in Atlanta was cheaper than actually filming in New York, a location closely associated with the character, though the production may \"end up [in New York] for one week or two\".[166] A replica of the Staten Island Ferry was built in Atlanta, with the ability to open and close in half in 10 to 12 seconds and be flooded with 40,000 gallons of water in 8 seconds.[167] Additional filming also occurred at two magnet schools in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles.[168]\n\nCasting continued after the start of production, with the inclusion of Isabella Amara, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Josie Totah,[80] Hannibal Buress,[72] Selenis Leyva,[77] Abraham Attah,[84] Michael Mando,[68] Tyne Daly,[48] Garcelle Beauvais, Tiffany Espensen,[62] and Angourie Rice in unspecified roles,[86] with Bokeem Woodbine joining as an additional villain.[47] At San Diego Comic-Con in 2016, Marvel confirmed the castings of Keaton, Zendaya, Glover, Harrier, Revolori, Daly, and Woodbine, while revealing Zendaya, Harrier, and Revolori's roles as Michelle, Liz Allan, and Flash Thompson, respectively,[26][36][43][169] and announcing the casting of Jacob Batalon as Ned.[36][37] Lewis Pullman also auditioned for Ned.[170] It was also revealed that the Adrian Toomes / Vulture would be the film's villain, while the writing teams of Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, joined Goldstein and Daley in writing the screenplay,[36] from Goldstein and Daley's story. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well.[171] Watts praised Goldstein and Daley's drafts as \"really fun and funny\", and said that they \"sort of established the broad strokes of the movie\", with him and Ford, close friends since childhood, then re-writing the script based on specific ideas that Watts had and things that he wanted to film, which he said was a \"pretty substantial structural pass, rearranging things and building it into the sort of story arc we wanted it to be\". McKenna and Sommers then joined the film to deal with changes to the script during filming, as \"it's all a little bit flexible when you get to set. You try things out, and you just need someone to be writing while you're shooting.\"[134]\n\nHarrier noted that the young actors in the film \"constantly refer to ourselves as The Breakfast Club\".[26] Shortly after, Martha Kelly joined the cast in an unspecified role.[90] In August, Michael Chernus was cast as Phineas Mason / Tinkerer,[67] while Jona Xiao joined the cast in an unspecified role,[172] and Buress said he was playing a gym teacher.[73] By September 2016, Jon Favreau was reprising his role as Happy Hogan from the Iron Man series,[22] and filming concluded in Atlanta and moved to New York City. Locations in the latter city included Astoria, Queens; Sunnyside, Queens; St. George, Staten Island; Manhattan;[173][174][175][176] and Franklin K. Lane High School in Brooklyn.[114] Additionally, UFC fighter Tyron Woodley said he had been considered for a villain role in the film, but had to drop out due to a prior commitment with Fox Sports.[177] Principal photography wrapped on October 2, 2016, in New York City,[178] with some additional filming taking place later in the month in Berlin, Germany, near the Brandenburg Gate.[179]\n\nPost-production[edit]\n\nIn November 2016, Feige confirmed that Keaton would play Adrian Toomes / Vulture,[18][180] while Woodbine was revealed as Herman Schultz / Shocker.[21][181] In March 2017, Harrier said the film was undergoing re-shoots,[182] and Evans was set to appear as Steve Rogers / Captain America in an instructional fitness video.[61] Watts was inspired by The President's Fitness Challenge for this, feeling that Captain America would be the obvious version of that for the MCU. He then started brainstorming other public service announcements (PSA) starring Captain America, about \"just anything you could think of, we had poor Captain America do it\". Watts said that many of the additional PSA videos would be featured on the home media of the film.[183] According to Goldstein, additional videos featuring other Avengers were planned at some point.[184] Watts confirmed that the company Stark creates that leads Toomes on his villainous path in the film is Damage Control, which Watts felt \"just fit in with our overall philosophy with the kind of story we wanted to tell\" and created a lot of practical questions Watts wanted to use \"to drive the story\".[59]\n\nThe film features multiple post-credit scenes.[59][185] The first gives the Vulture a chance at redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this \"was a really interesting thing in the development of the story. You couldn't just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family.\" The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a meta-referential joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene.[186] This was a \"last-minute addition\" to the film.[187] Watts completed work on Homecoming at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, \"You assume you'll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn't really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to.\"[134] That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school,[76] and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.[188]\n\nIn July, Feige discussed specific moments in the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 1 issue 33 (1966) where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige \"wanted to see in a movie for a long, long time\".[189] Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, \"We have [Parker] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem.\"[17] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of the first MCU film Iron Man (2008) when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, \"What does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique.\"[190] Goldstein added that it \"diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [and] lets her become part of what's really his life.\"[17] Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, feeling that if it did not work, the film would not work. The team \"worked backwards and forwards from that moment ... You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [and it] doesn't seem like something out of left field\".[189] Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, \"more than anything else, [what] I was looking forward to, and I got to have a lot of fun shooting that stuff\".[186] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were \"giddy when we first came up with [that twist], because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time\".[17]\n\nVisual effects[edit]\nTrixter used a LIDAR scan of Grand Central Terminal from The Avengers to help create their CGI version (bottom), adding to the elements filmed on set (top).[191]\nExternal videos\n Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Homecoming End Credits Final Main on End Title Sequence presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, YouTube video from Perception's channel\n\nVisual effects for the film were completed by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light & Magic, Luma Pictures, Digital Domain, Cantina Creative, Iloura, Trixter,[192] and Method Studios.[167] Executive producer Victoria Alonso initially did not want Imageworks, which worked on all previous Spider-Man films, to work on Homecoming, in order to give it a different look than those earlier films. She changed her mind after seeing what she called \"phenomenal\" test material from the vendor.[193] The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception.[194]\n\nTrixter contributed over 300 shots for the film, including the opening scene at Grand Central Terminal, the sequence that retells the events of Civil War from Parker's perspective, the sequence where Toomes takes Liz and Parker to the dance, the school battle between Parker and Schultz, and the scene around and within the Avengers compound. They also worked on both Spider-Man suits and the spider tracer. Trixter created additional salvage workers to populate the Grand Central scene, whose clothes and proportions were able to be altered to create variation. For the battle between Parker and Schultz, Trixter used an all-digital Spider-Man in his homemade suit, which came from Imageworks, with Trixter applying a rigging, muscle, and cloth system to it \"to mimic the appearance of the rather loose training suit\". They also created the effects for Schultz's gauntlets and had to change the setting from the Atlanta set to Queens, by using a CGI school and adding 360 degrees of matte paintings for the mid to far-distance elements. Trixter received concept art and basic geometry that was used previously for the Avengers compound, but ended up remodeling it for the way it appears in Homecoming. Models and textures for Spider-Man's Avengers costume were created by Framestore for use in a future MCU film, with Trixter creating the vault that it appears in. Trixter VFX supervisor Dominik Zimmerle said the idea was \"to have a clean, high tech, presentation Vault for the new suit. It should appear distinctively 'Stark' originated\".[191]\n\nDigital Domain worked on the Staten Island Ferry battle, creating the CGI versions of Spider-Man, the Vulture suit, Iron Man, and Spider-Man's drone. Digital Domain was able to LIDAR an actual Staten Island Ferry, as well as the version created on set, to help with creating their digital version.[167] Lou Pecora, visual effects supervisor at Digital Domain, called that sequence \"brutal\" because \"the way they were shot, it was lit to be a certain time of day, and afterwards it was decided to change that time of day\".[195] Sony Pictures Imageworks created much of the third act of the film when Parker confronts Toomes on the plane and beach in his homemade suit, and Toomes is in an upgraded Vulture suit. Some elements of Vulture's first suit were shared with Imageworks, but the remainder were created by them \"based on a maquette\". For the plane's cloaking ability, Imageworks was inspired by Adaptiv IR Camouflage tank cloaking system by BAE Systems, which \"uses a series of titles to cloak against infrared\". For their web design, which was based on the one created for Civil War, Digital Domain referenced polar bear hair because of its translucent nature. Imageworks also looked to the Civil War webs, as well as to those they had created for previous Spider-Man films, in which \"the web[s] had [...] tiny barbs that aided in hooking on to things\". For this film, they \"dialed back the barbs\" to line up more closely with the other web designs created for this film.[167] Method Studios worked on the Washington Monument sequence.[193] Iron Man's armor in the film, the Mark XLVII, is a recolored version of the MK XLVI armor introduced in Civil War; this was done because Sony did not have the budget to create a new Iron Man suit. Feige requested the color scheme resemble the Ultimate Iron Man armor from the comics.[196]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Spider-Man: Homecoming (soundtrack)\n\nWhile promoting Doctor Strange in early November 2016, Feige accidentally revealed that Michael Giacchino, who composed the music for that film, would compose the score for Homecoming as well. Giacchino soon confirmed this himself.[197] Recording for the soundtrack began on April 11, 2017.[198] The score includes the theme from the 1960s animated series.[199] The soundtrack was released by Sony Masterworks on July 7, 2017.[200]\n\nMarketing[edit]\n\nWatts, Holland, Batalon, Harrier, Revolori, and Zendaya appeared at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to show an exclusive clip of the film,[36][201] which also had a panel at Comic Con Experience 2016.[202] The first trailer for Homecoming premiered on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on December 8, 2016,[203] and was released online alongside an international version, which Feige thought was different enough that \"it would be fun for people to see both.\"[18] The shots of Vulture descending through a hotel atrium and Spider-Man swinging with Iron Man flying beside him were created specifically for the trailer. Watts explained that the Vulture shot was created for Comic-Con and \"was never meant to be in the movie\", but he was able to repurpose the angle for Vulture's reveal in the film. The Spider-Man and Iron Man shot was created because the marketing team wanted a shot of the two together, and existing shots \"just didn't look that great\" then. The trailer shot used a background plate taken when filming the subway in Queens.[115] The two trailers were viewed over 266 million times globally within a week.[103]\n\nOn March 28, 2017, a second trailer debuted after screening at CinemaCon 2017 the night before.[204] Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com, noted that the new Justice League trailer had received more Twitter mentions in that week but there was \"clearer enthusiasm for Spider-Man\". The Homecoming trailer was second for the week of March 20–26 in new conversations (85,859) behind Justice League (201,267), according to comScore's PreAct service, which is \"a tracking service utilizing social data to create context of the ever-evolving role of digital communication on feature films\".[205] An exclusive clip from the film was seen during the 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards.[206] On May 24, Sony and Marvel released a third domestic and international trailer.[207] Ethan Anderton of /Film enjoyed both trailers, stating Homecoming \"has the potential to be the best Spider-Man movie yet. Having the webslinger as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe just feels right\".[208] TechCrunch's Darrell Etherington agreed, saying, \"You may have feelings about a tech-heavy Spider-Man suit or other aspects of this interpretation of the character, but it's still shaping up to be better than any Spider-Man depicted in movies in recent memory.\"[209] Ana Dumaraog for Screen Rant said the second trailer \"arguably showed too much of the movie's overarching narrative\", but the third \"perfectly shows the right amount of new and old footage\". She also appreciated the attention to detail that Watts and the writers put into the film, as highlighted by the trailers.[210] Siddhant Adlakha of Birth.Movies.Death also felt the trailers were giving away too many details,[211] but enjoyed them overall, especially the \"vlogging\" aspect.[212] Collider's Dave Trombore expressed similar sentiments to Adlakha.[213] After the release of the trailers, comScore and its PreAct service noted Homecoming was the top film for new social media conversations, that week and the week of May 29.[214][215]\n\nAlongside the release of the third trailers were domestic and international release posters.[207] The domestic poster was criticized for its \"floating head\" style,[211][216] which offers \"a chaotic mess of people looking in different directions, with little sense of what the film will deliver\".[216] Dan Auty for GameSpot called it a \"star studded hot mess\",[216] while Vanity Fair's Katey Rich felt the poster was \"too bogged down by the many different threads of the Marvel universe to highlight anything that's made Spider-Man: Homecoming seem special so far\".[217] Adlakha felt the posters released for the film \"have been alright thus far, but these ones probably tell general audiences to expect a very bloated movie\". Adlakha was more positive of the international poster, which he felt was more \"comicbook-y\" and \"looks like it could be an actual scene from the film\".[211] Both Rich and Adlakha criticized the fact that Holland, Keaton, and Downey appeared twice on the domestic poster, both in and out of costume.[211][217] Sony partnered with ESPN CreativeWorks to create cross-promotional television ads for Homecoming and the 2017 NBA Finals, which were filmed by Watts. The ads were made to \"weave in a highlight from the game just moments\" after it occurred.[218] The promos see Holland, Downey Jr., and Favreau reprise their roles from the film, with cameo appearances from Stan Lee, DJ Khaled, Tim Duncan, Magic Johnson, and Cari Champion.[103] Through June and July 2017, a Homecoming-inspired cafe opened in the Roppongi Hills complex in Tokyo, offering \"arachnid-themed foods and drinks, including a Spider Curry, Spider-Sense Latte and a sweet and refreshing Strawberry Spider Squash drink\", as well as a free, limited-edition sticker with any purchase.[219]\n\nFor the week ending on June 11, comScore and its PreAct service noted that new social media conversations for the film were second only to Black Panther and its new trailer;[220] Homecoming was then the number one film in the next two weeks.[221][222] That month, Sony released a mobile app allowing users to \"access\" Parker's phone and \"view his photos, videos, text messages, and hear voicemails from his friends\". The app also provided an \"AR Suit Explorer\" to learn more about the technology in the Spider-Man suit, and use photo filters, GIFs, and stickers of the character.[223] Sony and Dave & Buster's also announced an arcade game based on the film, playable exclusively at Dave & Buster's locations.[224] A tie-in comic, Spider-Man: Homecoming Prelude, was released on June 20, collecting two prelude issues.[225] On June 28, in partnership with Thinkmodo, a promotional prank was released in which Spider-Man (stuntman Chris Silcox) dropped from the ceiling in a coffee shop to scare customers; the video also featured a cameo appearance from Lee.[226] Sony also partnered with the mobile app Holo to let users add 3D holograms of Spider-Man, with Holland's voice and lines from the film, to real-world photos and videos.[227] Before the end of June, Spider-Man: Homecoming—Virtual Reality Experience was released on the PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive for free, produced by Sony Pictures VR and developed by CreateVR. It allows users to experience how it feels to be Spider-Man, with the ability to hit targets with his web-shooters and face off against the Vulture. It was also available at select Cinemark Theatres in the United States and at the CineEurope trade show in Barcelona.[228]\n\nAhead of the film's release, for the week ending on July 2, the film was the top film for the third consecutive week for new social media conversations, according to comScore, which also noted that Spider-Man: Homecoming had produced a total of 2.67 million conversations to date.[229] Other promotions included Audi and Dell (both also had product placement in the film), Pizza Hut, General Mills, Synchrony Bank, MovieTickets.com, Goodwill, Baskin-Robbins, Dunkin' Donuts, Danone Waters, Panasonic Batteries, M&M's, Mondelez, Asus, Bimbo, Jetstar, KEF, Kellogg's, Lieferheld, PepsiCo, Plus, Roady, Snickers, Sony Mobile, Oppo, Optus, and Doritos. Watts directed a commercial for Dell's marketing efforts as well, which earned 2.8 million views online. Goodwill hosted a build-your-own Spider-Man suit contest, with the winner attending the film's premiere. Overall, the campaign generated over $140 million in media value, greater than those for all previous Spider-Man films and Marvel Studios' first 2017 release, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. This does not include merchandising for the film, which is controlled by Marvel and Disney.[230] Marketing of the film in China included partnering with Momo, iQiyi, Tencent QQ, Baidu, Mizone, CapitaLand, Xiaomi, HTC, and corporate parent Sony.[231][232] To help target the teenage audience, Holland \"recorded a high school entrance exam greeting\" while The Rap of China contestant PG One recorded a theme song.[231]\n\nRelease[edit]\nTheatrical[edit]\nThe world premiere of Spider-Man: Homecoming at TCL Chinese Theatre\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming held its world premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 28, 2017,[233] and was released in the United Kingdom on July 5.[234] It opened in additional international markets on July 6,[235] with 23,400 screens (277 of which were IMAX) in 56 markets for its opening weekend.[236] The film was released in the United States on July 7,[136] in 4,348 theaters (392 were IMAX and IMAX 3D, and 601 were premium large-format),[10][137][237] including 3D screenings.[10] It was originally slated for release on July 28.[136] Spider-Man: Homecoming is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[238]\n\nIn March 2024, Sony announced that all of their live-action Spider-Man films would be re-released in theaters as part of Columbia Pictures' 100th anniversary celebration. Spider-Man: Homecoming was re-released on May 20, 2024.[239]\n\nHome media[edit]\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming was released on digital download by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on September 26, 2017, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Ultra HD Blu-ray, and DVD on October 17, 2017. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[240] The physical releases in its first week of sale were the top home media release, according to NPD VideoScan data. The Blu-ray version accounted for 79% of the sales, with 13% of total sales coming from the Ultra HD Blu-ray version.[241]\n\nIn April 2021, Sony signed a deal with Disney giving them access to their legacy content, including past Spider-Man films and Marvel content in Sony's Spider-Man Universe, to stream on Disney+ and Hulu and appear on Disney's linear television networks. Disney's access to Sony's titles would come following their availability on Netflix. Homecoming had previously been available on Starz and FX.[242][243] The film became available on Disney+ in the United Kingdom and Australia on June 17, 2022,[244][245] and became available in the United States on May 12, 2023.[246]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming grossed over $334.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $546 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $880.2 million.[3] The film had the second-biggest global IMAX opening for a Sony film with $18 million.[236] In May 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that Homecoming was the second-most-anticipated summer blockbuster behind Wonder Woman.[247] By September 24, 2017, the film had earned $874.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing superhero film of 2017, and the sixth-largest film based on a Marvel character.[248] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $200.1 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it seventh on their list of 2017's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[249]\n\nThe film earned $50.9 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $15.4 million from Thursday night previews),[103] and had a total weekend gross of $117 million, the top film for the weekend.[250] It was the second-highest opening for both a Spider-Man film and a Sony film, after Spider-Man 3's $151.1 million debut in 2007.[103] Early projections for the film from BoxOffice had it earning $135 million in its opening weekend,[251] which was later adjusted to $125 million,[252] and Deadline Hollywood noting industry projections at anywhere between $90–120 million.[237] In its second weekend, the film fell to second behind War for the Planet of the Apes with $44.2 million, a 62% decline in earnings, which was similar to the declines The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3 had in their second weekends. Additionally, Homecoming's domestic gross reached $208.3 million, which surpassed the total domestic gross of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ($202.9 million).[253] The film fell to third in its third weekend.[254] By July 26, Homecoming's domestic gross reached $262.1 million, surpassing the total domestic gross of The Amazing Spider-Man ($262 million),[255] leading to a fifth-place finish for its fourth weekend.[256] The next weekend, Homecoming finished sixth,[257] and finished seventh the following five weekends.[258][259][260][261][262] By September 3, 2017, the film had earned $325.1 million,[261] surpassing the $325 million projected amount for its total domestic gross.[251] In its eleventh weekend, Homecoming finished ninth.[263]\n\nOutside of the United States and Canada, Spider-Man: Homecoming earned $140.5 million its opening weekend from the 56 markets it opened in, with the film becoming number one in 50 of them. The $140.5 million was the highest opening ever for a Spider-Man film.[236] South Korea had the highest Wednesday opening day gross,[264] which contributed to a $25.4 million five-day opening in the country, the third-highest opening ever for a Hollywood film.[236] Brazil had the largest July opening day of all time, with $2 million,[264] leading to an opening weekend total of $8.9 million. The $7 million earned from IMAX showings was the top opening of all time for a Sony film internationally.[236] In its second weekend, the film opened in France at number one and number two in Germany. It earned an additional $11.9 million in South Korea, to bring its total in the country to $42.2 million. This made Homecoming the highest-grossing Spider-Man film and the top-grossing Hollywood film of 2017 in the country. Brazil contributed an additional $5.7 million, for a total of $19.4 million from the country, which was also the largest gross from a Spider-Man film.[265] The film's third weekend saw the Latin America region set a record as the highest-grossing Spider-Man film of all time, with a region total of $77.4 million. Brazil remained the top-grossing market for the region, with $25.7 million. In South Korea, the film became the 10th-highest-grossing international release of all time.[266] Homecoming opened at number one in Spain in its fourth weekend.[267] In its sixth weekend, the film opened at number one in Japan, with its $770,000 from IMAX the fourth-largest IMAX weekend for a Marvel film in the country.[268] The film opened at number one in China on September 8, 2017, grossing $23 million on its opening day, including Thursday previews, making it the third biggest opening day for a Marvel Cinematic Universe film, behind Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War, and the largest opening day gross for a Sony film in the country.[231] The $70.8 million Homecoming earned in China for its opening weekend was the third-highest opening behind Age of Ultron and Civil War, with $6 million from IMAX, which was the best IMAX opening weekend in September, and the best IMAX opening weekend for a Sony film.[232] As of September 24, 2017, the film's largest markets were China ($115.7 million),[248] South Korea ($51.4 million), and the United Kingdom ($34.8 million).[269]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nTom Holland's performance as Spider-Man received praise.\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 92%, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 400 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Spider-Man: Homecoming does whatever a second reboot can, delivering a colorful, fun adventure that fits snugly in the sprawling MCU without getting bogged down in franchise-building.\"[270] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[271] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 89% overall positive score and a 74% \"definite recommend\".[103]\n\nMike Ryan at Uproxx felt Homecoming was the best Spider-Man film yet, specifically praising the light tone, younger and more optimistic portrayal of Parker, and Keaton's performance—Ryan named the Vulture twist reveal as one of his favorite scenes in the MCU. He said Homecoming is \"the kind of movie you leave and you're just in the best mood—and still will be days later.\"[272] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film unique and refreshing, praising its lower stakes and focus on the character's school life. He praised Holland as \"terrific and well-cast\", as well as the other cast members; Roeper believed that Keaton's performance is more interesting than the character otherwise could have been.[273] Owen Gleiberman of Variety felt the film was \"just distinctive enough\" from the previous Spider-Man films to become a \"sizable hit\", and highlighted its focus on making Peter Parker a realistically youthful and grounded character. He found Holland to be likable in the role and thought the Vulture twist was a positive direction for that character. He did criticize the vague take on Spider-Man's origin and powers, but \"the flying action has a casual flip buoyancy, and the movie does get you rooting for Peter.\"[1] At IndieWire, David Ehrlich criticized the film's superhero genre clichés and underwritten female characters, but praised the elements of the film that leaned into Parker's high school life and the humanity of the Vulture.[274]\n\nKenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the \"juvenile\" depiction of Parker and Watts' \"unevenly orchestrated\" direction, but feeling that the film \"finds its pace and rhythm by the end\" and praising Keaton's performance.[275] The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore found the film to be \"occasionally exciting but often frustrating\", and suggested it might have worked better if less focus had been put on integrating the film with the MCU. DeFore did praise Holland's performance as \"winning\" despite the script and called Zendaya a scene-stealer.[276] Mick LaSalle, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, said the film was a \"pretty good Spider-Man movie\" that \"breaks no new ground\", not exploring the human side of the character enough and instead focusing on action that is not thrilling.[277] At The Telegraph, Robbie Collin argued that \"a little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in Captain America: Civil War last year. But a lot of him goes almost nowhere in this slack and spiritless solo escapade.\" Collin criticized Watts's direction but was positive of the cast, including Holland, Keaton, Tomei, and Zendaya.[278]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nYear\tAward\tCategory\tRecipient(s)\tResult\tRef(s)\n2017\tTeen Choice Awards\tChoice Breakout Movie Star\tTom Holland\tNominated\t[279]\nZendaya\tNominated\nChoice Summer Movie\tSpider-Man: Homecoming\tWon\nChoice Summer Movie Actor\tTom Holland\tWon\nChoice Summer Movie Actress\tZendaya\tWon\nWashington D.C.

Jackson and Cobie Smulders also reprised their roles as Nick Fury and Maria Hill, respectively, from previous MCU media.[291]\n\nA third film was announced by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures in September 2019, after an impasse between the two companies was resolved during negotiations.[292] Watts returned to direct,[293] from a script by McKenna and Sommers.[294] Holland, Zendaya, Favreau, Tomei, Batalon,[295] and Revolori reprise their roles,[293] while Benedict Cumberbatch and Benedict Wong reprise their MCU roles as Doctor Strange and Wong.[296][295] Actors reprising their roles from previous Spider-Man films include Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield returning as their versions of Spider-Man from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films, respectively,[297] alongside Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus, and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman from Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, along with Rhys Ifans as Curt Connors / Lizard and Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon / Electro from Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films.[298] Spider-Man: No Way Home was released on December 17, 2021.[299]\n\nIn November 2021, Pascal revealed that Sony and Marvel Studios were planning on making at least three more Spider-Man films starring Holland, with work on the first of those films getting ready to begin.[300]\n\nSee also[edit]\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, an animated series set in an alternate timeline where Norman Osborn becomes Parker's mentor instead of Tony Stark[301][302]\nNotes[edit]\n^ As depicted in The Avengers (2012)[4]\n^ In November 2018, the Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years sourcebook adjusted the film's placement in the MCU timeline, ignoring the \"eight years later\" title card which was perceived to be a continuity error.[5] In October 2023, the book The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline further addressed the film's placement in the timeline as occurring in \"Fall 2016\", while noting that the eight years timeframe was incorrect and confirming that four years had passed in-universe.[6] See Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline for more.\n^ As depicted in Captain America: Civil War (2016)[7][8]\n^ Credited as J.J.

Its plot follows disparate characters in post-[World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") Southern [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio \"Ohio\") and [West Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia \"West Virginia\"), including a disturbed war veteran, a husband and wife who are [serial killers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer \"Serial killer\"), and an abusive [preacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preacher \"Preacher\").

As the novel progresses the lives of these people converge in unexpected ways.\n\nIn a prologue, Pollock introduces the protagonist, Arvin, as a young boy. He sits in a clearing with his father, Willard, on an oak log, joining him in his evening prayer routine. Willard is borderline obsessive when it comes to prayer and expects the same from his son. While Arvin prays, however, his mind wanders and feelings of isolation bubble to the surface. Feeling like an outsider at school, he is the victim of relentless bullying. Arvin recalls his father telling him to stand up for himself, but this is easier said than done.\n\nThe rest of the book is divided into seven parts. Part One, \"Sacrifice,\" begins in 1945, before the prologue. Willard is a young single man who has just been discharged from combat duty after the end of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"). As he sits on a bus headed to his home in Coal Creek, West Virginia, he recalls the horrifying things he saw and did during the war. One memory haunts him in particular: that of a soldier he comes across who has been skinned and crucified. Willard shoots the man as an [act of mercy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_de_gr%C3%A2ce \"Coup de grâce\"), putting an end to his suffering. The bus makes a stop at the Wooden Spoon Diner in [Meade, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meade,_Ohio \"Meade, Ohio\"). There, Willard meets and instantly falls in love with a beautiful waitress, Charlotte Willoughby. At home, he is met by his nervous and emotionally-damaged mother, Emma, and her brother, Uncle Earskell. Willard proceeds to get drunk, and his thoughts turn from the horrors of war to the beautiful waitress he just met. He lets it slip to his mother that he has fallen in love, which upsets her because she made a bargain with God that if he let her son live, she would arrange a marriage between Willard and poor Helen Hatton.\n\nAt church one evening, we meet Brother Roy and Brother Theodore, Roy’s fat and crippled cousin. They preach about letting God cure you of your worst fears and Roy dumps a bin full of spiders on his head, scaring almost everyone in the chapel. Helen takes a liking to Roy and they later have a daughter named Lenora.\n\nFeeling his connection with God lessen, Roy decides that in order to regain his bond he must crucify something and raise it from the dead. Theodore, who hates Helen for taking Roy’s attention, convinces Roy to kill her for the sacrifice. They take her out to a field and Roy stabs her in the neck with a screwdriver. As expected, Roy is unable to raise her from the dead and they flee the town, leaving Lenora with Emma (Willard's mother).\n\nLinking back up with other characters, Willard marries Charlotte and together they have a son whom they name Arvin. As the years pass, Willard becomes obsessed with prayer. The obsession only deepens when Charlotte is diagnosed with cancer. Willard's rituals become progressively more bizarre and upsetting, culminating in animal and even human sacrifice. Willard believes these acts of devotion are necessary to save his wife. Nevertheless, in the end, Charlotte still dies, prompting Willard to commit suicide. Traumatized by his parents' deaths and his father's behavior, Arvin lives with his grandmother, Emma. There, he meets Lenora, an orphan girl whom Emma takes in after her mother, Helen, is killed, the prime suspects in everyone’s mind being the traveling preacher named Roy who is also Lenora's father.\n\nIn Part 2, \"On the Hunt,\" the reader is introduced to Carl and Sandy Henderson, a pair of murderous [lowlifes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-life \"Low-life\") living in Meade who entertain themselves by picking up male hitchhikers and killing them. Their reign of terror is allowed to persist in part because Sandy's brother, [Sheriff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriffs_in_the_United_States \"Sheriffs in the United States\") Bodecker, is corrupt and incompetent. An unemployed photographer, Carl takes pictures of his victims, calling them models. In one exceedingly depraved image, Carl takes a photograph of Sandy holding the severed head of one of their victims in her arms as if it were a baby. It is Carl's favorite photo.\n\nIn Part 3, \"Orphans and Ghosts,\" Arvin and Lenora grow up and become very close. Arvin gets his father's gun on his 15th birthday and immediately is drawn to it. When Lenora is bullied at school, Arvin comes to her defense, fighting the bullies in a very brutal and malicious way. His great uncle decides it’s best to put the gun away for a little while. The book also repeatedly drops in on Carl and Sandy.\n\nPart 4, \"Winter,\" focuses largely on Carl and Sandy's murderous exploits.\n\nIn Part 5, \"Preacher,\" we learn more about Roy, the traveling preacher who killed Lenora's mother. Roy lives with his physically disabled cousin, Theodore. After moving on from the Coal Creek Church of the Holy Ghost Sanctified, Roy is replaced by a new preacher, Pastor Teagardin, who lives with his much younger wife, Cynthia. Lenora believes Teagardin to be an exceptionally holy man, but Arvin has his doubts. These suspicions are validated when the reader learns of Teagardin's seduction and sexual corruption of Cynthia. Teagardin then successfully seduces Lenora, getting the young girl pregnant. When Lenora confronts Teagardin about the pregnancy he denies his part in it, asking her who the townsfolk would believe: her, or their Preacher? With seemingly nowhere else to turn, Lenora commits suicide. Furious after putting the pieces of the story together, Arvin shoots Teagardin dead and flees Coal Creek.\n\nAfter Part 6, \"Serpents,\" which follows more of Carl's and Sandy's depraved, murderous rampage, the storylines of the major characters converge in the final section, titled \"Ohio.\" In the wake of Theodore's death, a repentant Roy returns to Appalachia to track down and apologize to Lenora, who has since died. Unfortunately, he encounters Carl and Sandy who make Roy their latest victim. Later, Carl and Sandy happen to pick up Arvin, but after they attack him, Arvin gets the upper hand and shoots both of them dead. Sheriff Bodecker pursues Arvin, and they end up in a standoff in the same clearing where Willard performed sacrifices. Arvin kills Bodecker and walks down the highway, full of hope for the first time in a long while.\n\nWriting for _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_New\\_York\\_Times \"The New York Times\")_, Josh Ritter praised the novel, describing its prose as \"sickly beautiful as it is hard-boiled. [Pollock]'s scenes have a rare and unsettling ability to make the reader woozy, the ends of the chapters flicking like black horseflies off the page.\"[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_All_the_Time#cite_note-ny-2) Lisa Shea of _[Elle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle\\_(magazine) \"Elle (magazine)\")_ wrote that the \"flawless cadence of Pollock's gorgeous shadow-and-light prose plays against the heinous acts of his sorrowful and sometimes just sorry characters.\"[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_All_the_Time#cite_note-3) Carolyn Kellogg of the _[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los\\_Angeles\\_Times \"Los Angeles Times\")_ praised Pollock's narrative method, writing that he \"deftly shifts from one perspective to another, without any clunky transitions – the prose just moves without signal or stumble, opening up the story in new ways again and again..._The Devil All the Time_ should cement his reputation as a significant voice in American fiction.\"[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_All_the_Time#cite_note-4)\n\nJeff Baker of _[The Oregonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Oregonian \"The Oregonian\")_ noted that the novel \"reads as if the love child of [[Flannery] O'Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flannery_O%27Connor \"Flannery O'Connor\") and [[William] Faulkner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Faulkner \"William Faulkner\") was captured by [Cormac McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy \"Cormac McCarthy\"), kept in a cage out back and forced to consume nothing but onion rings, Oxycontin and [Terrence Malick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Malick \"Terrence Malick\")'s _[Badlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands\\_(film) \"Badlands (film)\")_.\"[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_All_the_Time#cite_note-5)_[Publishers Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishers\\_Weekly \"Publishers Weekly\")_ commented \"If Pollock's powerful collection _Knockemstiff_ was a punch to the jaw, his follow-up, a novel set in the violent soul-numbing towns of southern Ohio and West Virginia, feels closer to a mule's kick, and how he draws these folks and their inevitably hopeless lives without pity is what the kick's all about.\"[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_All_the_Time#cite_note-6)\n\nThe French literary publication _[Lire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lire\\_(magazine) \"Lire (magazine)\")_ named _The Devil All the Time_ as the best novel of the year in 2012.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_All_the_Time#cite_note-7)\n\n*   Won—2012 [Grand Prix de Littérature Policière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_de_Litt%C3%A9rature_Polici%C3%A8re \"Grand Prix de Littérature Policière\")[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_All_the_Time#cite_note-8)\n*   Won—2012 Prix du Livre de l'Année (Magazine _Lire_)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_All_the_Time#cite_note-9)\n*   Won—2012 Thomas and Lillie D.
