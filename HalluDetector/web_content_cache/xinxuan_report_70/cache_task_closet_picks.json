(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw0294514/?ref_=tturv_2)\nEdward Yang's \"A Brighter Summer Day\" is an enormous film, not only in length but in its ambitious attempt, through homing in on a particular group of people in a specific time and place, to define the attitudes of a nation undergoing an identity crisis. The time is the early '60's, the place a suburb of Taipei, the characters mostly groups of adolescents. Like his great fellow compatriot Hou Xiaoxian, Yang hurls happenings at you without explaining who is who. He makes an enormous demand on his audience in forcing us to make all the connections. As his cast here runs into dozens and many scenes take place in semi-darkness, it is far from easy, particularly for a Western viewer to whom so many Orientals look alike, to make these connections on a first viewing. Indeed I would say that after four viewings I am still working out who is who. That I have not given up and am still in the process of unravelling can only be ascribed to a gut reaction from the first that this is a work of tremendous integrity and skill. The film deals mainly with gang warfare between rival groups of youngsters, which, it is suggested, reflects their search for identity at a time when their parents have lost theirs after years of Japanese occupation followed by the post-revolutionary separation from their Chinese mainland roots. As a diversion from gang warfare some of the youngsters find an outlet in American music, particularly the songs of Elvis. The film mainly follows the course of one boy, S'ir, as he moves from early to late adolescence. There are others who are presented as having a stronger sense of character; Ma, the \"General's son\" for instance who lives in a household a cut above the rest and Honey, a young man in a sailor suit, who exudes a sense of honesty and authority that holds the others in thrall. But it is S'ir whom the film doggedly follows, S'ir who seems to possess nothing much more than a bad temper and a developing desire, perhaps mainly through peer pressure, to have a young girl who will be faithful to him. It is his frustration in trying to achieve this that leads the film towards a climax that is as ugly as it is tragic. However, not before we have lived through a number of scenes that are wholly remarkable, none more so that a savage attack between rival gangs, some resorting to samurai swords - a reaction perhaps to their parents' detestation of all thing Japanese - which takes place in semi-darkness in a powercut during a tropical storm; the very stuff of late Goya, merciless and unblinking.\nHelpful\n•\n21\n11\njandesimpson (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1555753/?ref_=tturv_usr_2_t)\nMar 27, 2002\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw0294514/?ref_=tturv_perm_2)\n8\n/\n10\nWelcome to hell on earth. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw2777475/?ref_=tturv_3)\nThis bleak Taiwanese epic based on a true story exposes the dark side of growing up in a harsh environment at a young age. I know what you're thinking, \"Wow, so original.\" But, even though it's far from being the first film of its kind, let alone the best, it manages to stay unpredictable throughout and packs plenty of surprises; think of the grand sweep of The Godfather flicks and that's similar to what you get here. Visually, it doesn't really stand out in any significant way - at least from the print I saw. Instead, going for a more down-to-earth, gritty approach, which I liked because it suited the material. With that said, Director Edward Yang makes great use of long shots and keeps things very subtle, and I honestly can't think of a single bad or out-of-place angle in the film. The cast consisting almost entirely of nonprofessionals is very natural in their roles, even eerily believable at times when the film reaches disturbing moments - and there's a lot of those. It's a no-holds barred film that refuses to compromise itself for the sake of making the viewer feel safe or comfortable.\nAs a coming-of-age film, it's one of the very best. As a tragic romance, it delivers due to its Shakespearean quality. As a crime film, it can stand toe-to-toe with some of the very best of them. Even more impressive is that the film is able to cover so many important and (still) relevant issues and effectively explore the human condition without any heavy-handed morals or messages. The film is as straightforward and honest as they come, making it that much more engaging. And yet, despite all its qualities, it's not a film with universal appeal. Most would frown at its bleak approach and wonder where all the praise comes from. Others would skip it entirely due to it being a slow 4 hour film with no exploitative elements. Others would be wishing everyone were killed off and/or there was more action and pretentious imagery they could easily gravitate towards. Others.....well, I think you get the picture. Ultimately, those who would get the most out of this film are those who are willing to acknowledge that the world is a messed up place and some movies are going to reflect that. So, if you're easily offended, go back to watching \"safe\" Hollywood pictures, because you won't be able to appreciate this underrated gem. And yeah, that's me being a condescending prick. Sue me, what I say is true, and those who have seen the film know I'm right.\nI'm going to go ahead and admit right off the bat that what I just wrote does not do justice to the film's level of substance and depth. This is merely a description. Others have gone far more in-depth into what makes the film so good than I'm capable of doing from a single viewing, so I recommend reading what they've wrote as well.\nHelpful\n•\n14\n7\nAbyss47 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35177660/?ref_=tturv_usr_3_t)\nApr 4, 2013\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw2777475/?ref_=tturv_perm_3)\n10\n/\n10\none of the greatest films of all time (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw0294512/?ref_=tturv_4)\nThis film is prefaced in a historical context, with the understanding that Chinese Taiwan was formed in 1949 with several million Chinese being forced to cross over into Taiwan from mainland China, into a world they knew nothing about, so they were required to build their new lives with great insecurity about the future, and this film is about their first generation of offspring, the anxieties of the parents created a world of anxieties for their children, who search for their own greater security and their own self identity through the formation of street gangs, whose inner turmoil is largely a reflection of the world around them.  The Taiwanese identity is revealed to be a sense of perpetual exile.\nEdward Yang's own father fled from Shanghai.  Artifacts from other countries have great  impact in this film, the use of Japanese samurai swords which are ultimately used as murder weapons, Russian novels are read by teenagers and understood as `swordsmen' novels, a family's observation that the Chinese fought the Japanese for 20 years only to then live in Japanese houses listening to Japanese music, an old tape recorder that has been left behind by the WWII American forces is used to adapt American lyrics and American rock n roll music for the Chinese, the film features American doo-wop music, first love, cigarettes, casual dress, the influence of Hollywood motion picture magazines and movies, the voice of John Wayne can be heard in one of the movie theaters, the title of the film comes from the Elvis Presley song,  `Are You Lonesome Tonight,'  a comment on the dark cloud hanging over everyone's heads, hardly a brighter, summer day.\nThe film took 5 years in preparation, and although completed in 1991, it has never found a distributor, it involves a cast of over 100 speaking parts, largely non-professional teen-age actors, 92 different sets, it takes place in the poorer Tapei district in 1961,  using the filmmaker's own memories of his adolescence, shot at his high school, inspired by a true incident of a 14 year old boy murdering a 13 year old girl, the first juvenile murder case in Taiwan's history, the film opens and closes with an old, broken down radio broadcasting the lists of graduating students.  In this context of a repressive, militaristic government, family chaos, the constant threat of gang fights, the need for a good education, the idea that hard work can bring success, is seen as paramount.\nFor all those `Yi Yi'  fans who don't understand the complexity of this film, let me just remind you about the title,  `A Brighter, Summer Day,' this is a film for which those words have no meaning, and unlike  `Yi Yi,' which had the charming optimism of Yang-Yang, an as yet undeveloped child who has a future,  `Yi Yi `  was much more a  `perfect'  film, everything was neatly examined and explained, there's a perfect symmetry, on whole it's balanced, it feels like a complete experience, but  `A Brighter Summer Day' offers no such peace of mind, it's a raw emotional roller coaster where the last hour or so is filled with such complete anguish and despair, nearly all the family members have their singular moments where they are the focus of the pain and anguish, the understated personal horrors can leave one breathless.  Most of the world's viewing audience of films have been spared this kind of personal degradation, and therefore have no personal reference points to connect with such despair, but Yang, to his credit, spares no one. The film's greatness lies in it's complete lack of artifice, it's meticulously chosen shot selection, brilliant imagery mixed with an equally brilliant narrative, a devastating portrait of children on the precipice of darkness, one of the more complex human examinations of the after-effects of a subjugated nation, which is still, at heart, a police state, yet there is a breaking out from the bonds of repression by rebellious teen-age kids who have affectations of violence and a love of Elvis, freedom, and rock n roll.\nHelpful\n•\n118\n20\ncranesareflying (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1103053/?ref_=tturv_usr_4_t)\nMar 31, 2001\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw0294512/?ref_=tturv_perm_4)\n10\n/\n10\nTouchingly intimate (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw1659514/?ref_=tturv_5)\nSpoiler\nHelpful\n•\n49\n10\nhoward.schumann (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0491610/?ref_=tturv_usr_5_t)\nMay 21, 2007\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw1659514/?ref_=tturv_perm_5)\n10\n/\n10\nIncredible epic of Taiwan street gangs (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw0294510/?ref_=tturv_6)\nEdward Yang's massive four hour epic \"A Brighter Summer Day\" is one of the true masterpieces of the 1990s and of the \"New Taiwan cinema.\" It's ostensibly the story of a few rival street gangs in '60s Taiwan, but the film is about a single young man's rites of passage in an era in which his country was experiencing a major upheaval. The film is so meticulous in its construction and its feeling of community (its preparation, filming and post-production took several years) that at the same time its length automatically gives it an epic quality it is a remarkably intimate film that is about as far from an epic in the traditional (Hollywood) sense as possible. There are over a hundred speaking parts in the film and it is necessary to stay focused in order to keep track of what's going on and to whom, which is a good trick to make sure your audience is always paying attention. \"A Brighter Summer Day\" is a very personal vision that recalls both Yang's own childhood and an actual street murder that shook the nation.\nThe film itself slowly builds towards this singular act of violence that, when it finally arrives, is both shocking and inevitable. \"A Brighter Summer Day\" keeps with the trend among the finest films to emerge from Taiwan in that it is very pared down - the cast are all nonactors and there is no non-diagetic music. It is beautifully shot, moving from the interiors of houses, schools, and cheap dance clubs to the open fields of the countryside in summertime. Alternating between violence and serenity, the film is a rhythmic and poetic evocation of a particular era. Its ironic title (in that there is no \"brighter summer day\" for these characters) is taken from an Elvis song that one of the kids sings at a nightclub. It is a truly exemplary modern masterpiece that got no distribution in the West but deserves to be hunted out at all costs by those who love and cherish the film art.\nHelpful\n•\n39\n10\nliehtzu (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0065227/?ref_=tturv_usr_6_t)\nJun 4, 2000\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw0294510/?ref_=tturv_perm_6)\n10\n/\n10\nA lost masterpiece (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw1847015/?ref_=tturv_7)\nI saw this film on screen in 2005. The place I saw it was an old-fashioned theater in the middle of Seoul, South Korea. The film print was one of the last surviving print of this film, which is now worn out too much for another screening. It was about three years ago, and I frankly do not much about the plot. Two things, however, were still in my mind. First of all, it was much more a film with tranquility. Think about Edward Yang's last film 'Yi Yi.' Do you remember the scene where there were two teenagers walking on the street and there were scarcely any sound effect but someone's monologue? The whole film was like that. The other thing is that, despite of it deals with serious subject matters such as Taiwan's cruel anti-communist regime, it still has a sense of humor: in fact, a plenty of it. For me, now this film is like a lost summer love: passionate but vague. If complicated copyright issues be solved and clean prints of this film to be found, I'd really like to recommend this film; it is a long four-hour movie, but every minute is worth it.\nHelpful\n•\n28\n13\nxym07 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0527878/?ref_=tturv_usr_7_t)\nMar 26, 2008\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw1847015/?ref_=tturv_perm_7)\n10\n/\n10\nas a Chinese living in mainland，I should let you know something about that special period in movie.

And they were just in a fear of communist party military coming into Taiwan.At that special period,another fears were among all ordinary people in Taiwan. The president of Guomin party began to arrest communist spy in Guomin party.in fact,the secret arrest was a terrible horrible to people in Taiwan. This special period is called as 'white fear period',and so many innocent persons dead at that time.\nSo,you can see tanks were running in road，and dad were arrested for suspects communist spy.At all,the fears were among whole society.\nwhat's more, in 1949 there were million people fleeing to Taiwan for following the Guomin Party. And many knowledge persons and military officers also in the process.this led government couldn'却 have enough money to pay and enough food to feed . many people lose their jobs.This is a hard time for many families. And it was not a peace time. it is a hungry time, Ming's family is a example.\nAlthough,the director want to tell a lesson , don'却 try to change the bad world.but we can know he still have a soft and ideal heart but getting hurt too much.\nHelpful\n•\n24\n11\nquanqiutongshi (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur77617827/?ref_=tturv_usr_8_t)\nJun 28, 2017\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw3741644/?ref_=tturv_perm_8)\n10\n/\n10\nA classic that will stay with you for a long, long time. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw1919252/?ref_=tturv_9)\nI just finished watching this four hour epic and something tells me that this is going to remain with me for a long, long time. I was glad I entered the cinema hall with no foreknowledge of what the film was about or anything about the story, except that it was directed by Edward Yang, whose Yi Yi I liked. Am I not glad I did that? The entire film, especially the second half, is an emotional powerhouse. Its funny, sociological and emotionally brutal.\nThe four hour run time was quite a deterrent however I planned it well and took one bathroom break but it was all worth it in the end. I would not recommend that you read anything of the story before you watch the film because several of the reviews above have spoilers in them. All I'll say is that it is about street gangs, but like nothing you've ever seen. It about lost childhood and children growing up so fast that its scary. The fact that all of this really happened makes it chilling.\nI'm surprised that not many people have seen this film yet because it certainly deserves a classic status. The direction is probably one of the best I've ever experienced and I will definitely seek out other Edward Yang movies to watch.\nThe acting by all the teenage actors and children is nothing short of brilliant and I can see that some of the key actors never acted in another movie again which I believe is a waste.\nI don't think its out on video as yet, however I would highly recommend that you seek it out. In my opinion the film demands total attention and is best watched on the big screen rather than on video.\nHelpful\n•\n19\n8\ncrappydoo (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5633386/?ref_=tturv_usr_9_t)\nJul 26, 2008\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw1919252/?ref_=tturv_perm_9)\n6\n/\n10\nGood, but long, film (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw8976218/?ref_=tturv_10)\nA Bright Summer Day, directed by Edward Yang, is a Taiwanese coming-of-age film set in the 1960s. While the film does have some redeeming qualities, overall, it falls short of expectations.\nThe plot of the film is slow-paced, and the story seems disjointed at times. The characters' motivations and struggles are not always clear, making it difficult to become fully invested in their stories. The film also lacks any clear resolution, leaving the audience feeling somewhat unsatisfied.\nThe performances are generally solid, but some of the performances fall flat, particularly in the earlier parts of the movie. Additionally, the film's soundtrack and cinematography, while well-done, are not particularly memorable.\nOne notable aspect of the film is the director's attempt at capturing the adolescent experience, as the story does delve deep into the complexities of coming-of-age, particularly in Asian societies. But even in this regard, some of the plot points are a bit clichéd and overdone.\nOverall, A Bright Summer Day has its moments, but it is ultimately a forgettable entry in the coming-of-age genre. While some viewers may appreciate the attempt at capturing the nuances of adolescent life, others may find the plot and characters lacking in depth and development.

However, I never truly got invested in these characters or the plot, which is mostly about adolescent males vying for dominance with one another, between gangs and within a gang, leading to tragic events. The way it's told is quite ponderous yet often manages to be confusing, and it's strange that a brutal act of revenge doesn't seem to result in anything. There were some interesting moments related to the detention and questioning of the father for political reasons, but they also don't seem to come to much either. The film is far, far too long at four hours, and in all its dreariness it became a chore to finish for me.

Who knows) a major landmark film, and a film that is about so much in four hours while being mostly about the lives of normal people trying to live - and uh, you know, would-be or actual teen gangs - between 1959 and 1961 in Taipei in Taiwan.\nI've eeen Yi Yi and loved it, so this didn't seem like much of a stretch to take in next. Finally watching it, Id say it is... Good. Really good. There are times it's splendid and even mesmerizing in how Yang elevates the everyday and understated into something close to poetry. And the final twenty to thirty minutes, when it's leading up to and that big incident occurs, it almost feels as though it *should* be greater than it is.\nHere's why I think I find myself somewhat at a remove from it, at least on a first go-around: Yang shoots much of this, or at least 40% or so of it, at a remove with characters often far away in the shots or at the least Id wager with long lenses, and while he does also in that other 60% go in tighter on people (for example that interrogation with the Father in the second half), he also is a fan of shrouding characters in darkness in certain major set pieces (ie the gangfights/brawls, one of which with a particularly important weapon), and sometimes that point does work to be evocative of this mysterious connection or lack thereof between teens of opposite sexes (there's a lovely scene of a conversation where the boy and girl are in silhouette and she is walking back and forth on a beam, and it's as though her voice is coming from everywhere). He shoots plainly, simply, often in long takes, sometimes deliberately with a character talking to another off screen.\nIn other words, this movie is entertaining... But it's also, for lack of a better word, work. This isn't to take away from anyone who immediately connects to this dedicatedly stripped down approach to storytelling. And this approach pays off in particular in the second half (you know, two hours of this four hour epic) as the lives of this family and this boy Si'r are becoming more ensconced in drama they can or cannot control, and when deep wells of emotion do bubble up and roil over.\nAnd most of all what makes much of this so different and (in a good way) unique among epic films of this length and scope is that the main character isnt, until near the end, some dark or brooding character, but a good person who is trying to figure out who he is in relation to the world, that being among these teen roughs like Ma and Honey (the latter being maybe the most memorable character in the film), and he is going through a slow but sure coming of age in this city, and looking back (more intellectually than emotionally) I admire how Yang ties Si'r and his feelings of uncertainty and reticence and trying to be one thing and falling into the demise of his own self into Taiwan at the time itself. It's more when I read other reviews that bring this up, that the film on the whole is like a giant metaphor for the death of a nation in the shade of another one (all being exiles and immigrants from China due to... All what happened there and all), and this eventual crime being so inexplicable and yet maybe it could have or should have been seen coming?\nI think that it isn't fair to call some of this dull, I know that. But there is a fine line to walk when having understated and naturalistic dramatic scene after understated and naturalistic dramatic scene, and it being *this* long. If it were even two and a half hours it might be in my estimation astonishing. On the other hand, I also have to admit taking the scissors to the movie as is would take some of the heart out of it (for example, the stuff with the Mom who has Asthma, does that need to be there? It does matter as part of the dramatic fabric of the family, so maybe?)\nIn a film like this, dramatic or just memorable set pieces really do help to break up the flow of things, and Yang is absolutely not a filmmaker all about that; he does get to them, at least by the time we get to concert scenes and those gang fights, but they aren't his primary focus. At the same time, there just.... Wasn't the level of pathos that clicked for me with the dynamics of these characters.\nI fully admit that this could change one day if I have another full day to kick my feet up and dig in to this massive but subtle full course meal of cinema. I also always say I prefer a (in his/her element) filmmaker to do more than less. Do I even feel guilty about giving it four stars? I definitely found much to be taken with here, and Chen's performance is kind of incredible as a kid who is more like a lot of us watching: unsure, decent, and, if put into the wrong path, capable of doing bad things. It works as an empathetic story. It's just.... So much of it?\nHelpful\n•\n8\n3\nQuinoa1984 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0453068/?ref_=tturv_usr_15_t)\nFeb 17, 2021\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw6604663/?ref_=tturv_perm_15)\n10\n/\n10\na superb film (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw0294511/?ref_=tturv_16)\nEdward Yang's four-hour study of Taiwanese youth gangs in 1960 and their search for personal and national identity is a stunning film; its scope and narrative power reminded me of seeing \"The Godfather\" for the first time.

Yang doesn't hurry through the proceedings, allows the atmosphere to setup gradually, provides sufficient breathing space to our multitudes of characters and captures the tragedy with tenderness & poignancy.\nThe cynical setting & uneasy atmosphere our protagonist finds at school & home quietly inform his later actions and Chang Chen portrays his journey with subtlety & layers in his performance. But at 237 minutes, it's a lot to take in. And the glacial pace doesn't make the ride easier either. It is less a story of one character's journey and more a snapshot of a milieu. And even though it is richly carved, not everyone will resonate with it.\nOverall, A Brighter Summer Day is an all-encompassing exercise in character, setting & milieu that will dazzle some with its dispassionate look at teenaged passions but may also leave few underwhelmed by its vast empty spaces, plodding pace & excessive runtime. It is beautifully shot, is told with gentleness and paints a fascinating slice of life in 1960s Taiwan but the story is engaging only in snippets and left me feeling indifferent in the end.\nHelpful\n•\n1\n0\nCinemaClown (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tturv_usr_21_t)\nJun 25, 2023\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw9145135/?ref_=tturv_perm_21)\n7\n/\n10\nBeautifully Filmed Slice Of Taiwanese History (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw5723373/?ref_=tturv_22)\nOne of the things I most appreciate about foreign films is the chance to learn a lot about a culture I've never been exposed to. \"A Brighter Summer Day\" is such a journey.

We might not know about what happened after the Nationalist forces established the modern Republic of China.\nEdward Yang's \"Guling jie shaonian sharen shijian\" (\"A Brighter Summer Day\" in English) focuses on a disillusioned teenager in Taiwan in the late '50s-early '60s. Affected by his parents' uncertainty about the future due to their dislocation - as well as Chiang Kai-shek's less-than-democratic governance - he joins a street gang. It becomes clear that something big is going to happen.\nThe movie (Taiwan's submission as Best Foreign Language Film to the 64th Academy Awards) has a deliberately ironic title, based on a line from an Elvis Presley song: there's nothing bright or sunny about people's uncertainty about their future, the country's repressive rule, or the undermining of Confucian values. Indeed, Elvis's music is but one example of the influence that the West wields over Taiwan (note the theater showing a Marilyn Monroe movie). I don't know whether or not this movie is considered Yang's grand masterpiece, but it's certainly a candidate for that title. If you consider yourself a film buff, then you owe it to yourself to see the movie. It might also make you want to go to Taiwan (in my case, I have an acquaintance there).\nHelpful\n•\n2\n0\nlee_eisenberg (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4888011/?ref_=tturv_usr_23_t)\nApr 16, 2025\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw10456187/?ref_=tturv_perm_23)\n7\n/\n10\nBeautiful painting with pale colors (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw9923980/?ref_=tturv_24)\nI don't mean to deny the interesting things about the movie. In fact, I was hesitant to rate this movie. The movie was a big hit and was rated excellent by many people. I don't deny it. In fact, I really wanted to applaud the set design, production design, behind the scenes, costumes, and cinematography team. They all created some of the most beautiful movie frames I have ever seen. It has been a long time since I have seen a film with such beautiful frames. The scenes are like paintings depicting the people and everyday stories of the 60s, extremely convincing and realistic. Those everyday scenes fascinated me. Those paintings are shown wonderfully. It is so real. The story is told in a linear timeline, with quite a few characters appearing in random scenes which can sometimes be a bit confusing, but the story isn't too difficult to understand. I don't know if this story is completely accurate to the real event, but it is quite similar to many incidents that have happened near where I live in recent years. Love. Youth. Never gets old. The English songs in the movie performed by the characters are also an interesting highlight. I really enjoyed these songs.\nBut the unfortunate thing about this movie is the viewer's perspective. I feel like I'm looking at the film through a window, instead of directly feeling it. In addition to the limitations in the technique of performing action scenes, the film also doesn't go deep enough into the characters. There are many characters, so everything doesn't seem to focus enough on the main characters. There are scenes that are long-winded and there are scenes that I just wish the director had gone into more detail, like describing the character's emotions. The most important thing is that the love story between two main characters is told quite simply. The character Liu Zhiming should have been clearly described. While she was the cause of most of the events. I haven't mentioned Zhang Zhen's transformation from good to bad person quite suddenly and illogically. It is impossible for a good student to suddenly curse the school doctor, just as it is impossible for him to still get into university despite his mental instability and aggression. The things he does are not convincing enough and unnatural. His family has 5 siblings, and except for the last scene, 1-2 scenes of the family having dinner, they rarely have scenes together. Look at how effective that last scene is. Even the middle sister running into the police station crying while the mother and eldest sister have cold expressions, which is quite weird because the middle sister is not described much before.\nI wanted to love this movie as much as I did love the beautiful scenes in it. If only the characters had more emotional scenes and more meaningful lines, this could have been one of the great things to ever appear on the big screen. But for me, this is more a historical documentary about Taiwanese society in the 60s than a memorable sad love story.\nIn my head I imagine a scene that isn't in the movie, but I wish it was, where Ming and Zhen are sitting together under a banyan tree in some park, and he gives her something, a hairpin maybe, they talk about some everyday things, and then when it comes to the scene where Zhen lunges at Ming with that knife, the hairpin (or whatever) falls down and he picks it up, that would be my favorite connection to the ending.\nI have read some reviews here and there is a review by a Chinese friend who told me about the history of the political events in the movie. I wanna say thank you to him/her, clearly the value of this movie in the flow of world history is very precious. But I value the emotional and climax moments more than the beautiful and metaphorical scenes, which are attractive to literature lovers.\nHelpful\n•\n0\n0\ndakuchonekobing (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur90785248/?ref_=tturv_usr_24_t)\nJul 27, 2024\nPermalink (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw9923980/?ref_=tturv_perm_24)\n5\n/\n10\nMy humble opinion (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/review/rw2467479/?ref_=tturv_25)\nTime for some counterbalance.

He writes scripts and inter-titles, and for some years he is the main editor at Nordisk Film. After those years of apprenticeship he gets the opportunity to direct his first film in 1917. Dreyer wanted his films to carry his personal imprints down to the smallest details, and already in his first silent movies it's possible to find stylistic traits that characterize his entire film production until his last film in 1964. The settings of his first films are naturalistic, but for Dreyer realism is not an art in itself. Only psychological realism is. His main interest is not the outer life, but the inner, emotional life of human beings. Emotions are most visible in facial expressions, and Dreyer's films are full of close-ups of human faces. By capturing the subtle, visual expressions of his characters, Dreyer tries to reveal the feelings they conceal and the storms that are raging inside them. Although many of his films end in tragedy, his intention is always to create a hymn to the triumph of the soul over life. Dreyer's own character was just as complex and contradictory as his film characters. Many of the actors he worked with describe him as a modest, amiable man, who was quiet in his statements, but intense and strong-willed inside. While his outer appearance was utterly self-effacing, he had at the same time an insistent stubbornness, which didn't accept any artistic compromises.\nDirector\nTorben Skjødt Jensen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0421721/?ref_=ls_li_1_1)\nStars\nClara Pontoppidan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0690702/?ref_=ls_li_2_1)\nHélène Falconetti (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4195101/?ref_=ls_li_2_2)\nLisbeth Movin (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0610228/?ref_=ls_li_2_3)\nSpine number: 128\nBox set: Carl Theodor Dreyer Box Set (no. 124)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054407/?ref_=ls_i_132)\n132.

Drawing heavily from his own childhood, as well as inspiration from Italian neorealism and 1950s Hollywood melodramas such as\nRebel Without a Cause (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048545/)\n, Truffaut charts the antics of bright but unruly misfit\nAntoine Doinel (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230700/)\n(\nJean-Pierre Léaud (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0529543/)\n), who, without a sense of purpose, consistently gets into trouble with teachers and his parents.\nTruffaut’s kinetic and restless camera style is keyed to the boundless energy of youth, and even the most carefully blocked and framed shots have a feel of spontaneity to them. But\nThe 400 Blows (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/)\nultimately belongs to Léaud.

Akerman made this 13-minute short at the age of 18, and its debt to the antic energy and seriocomic political inclinations of the French New Wave makes it an outlier in a body of work fixated on structuralism and more meditative atmospheres.

Think about the movies you've been told are core parts of the film canon -- \"\nCitizen Kane (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/)\n,\" \"\nVertigo (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052357/)\n,\" \"\nThe Godfather (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/)\n\" -- and so on and so forth. What do most of them have in common besides bringing significant and positive changes to the medium? They are directed by established men who had proven their talents time and time again. However, outside of a few exceptions, the so-called \"film canon\" rarely takes female directors and their work into account. While recent history has been more kind to these artists as women's work is increasingly championed across the industry, there are still staggeringly few movies directed by women that have been widely referred to as essential viewing.\nHowever, according to the British Film Institute's Sight and Sound magazine, that might change.

The previous champions were\nVertigo (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052357/)\n,\nCitizen Kane (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/)\n, and Bicycle Thieves, which typically hold spots in the top 10.

It is simple, ordinary, and expected. Romance in horror films, however, is chaotic, bloody, and revolting. Horror and eroticism are an unexpected sweetness, so go ahead and serve that with your morning toast. Monsters have indulged in romance with mortals as we have seen in The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) to more recent movies like\nThe Shape of Water (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580390/)\n(2017). It’s a classic story about a beautiful woman and a hideous beast, but even cinema changed the familiar storyline.\nThe 1970s opened an endless coffin of vampire films about love, sexuality, and the survival of the fittest. Open relationships, casual sex, gender fluid romances, and bloodthirsty villains painted the theater towns crimson red. The decade brought light to cultural issues that never seemed to be reflected on the mirrors of prior vampire films.\nSee full article at DailyDead (https://dailydead.com/celebrating-50-years-of-the-rise-of-the-female-vampire-in-daughters-of-darkness-1971/)\n11/5/2021\nby Leticia Lopez\nDailyDead (https://dailydead.com/celebrating-50-years-of-the-rise-of-the-female-vampire-in-daughters-of-darkness-1971/)\nNo Woman Can Cook the Same Meal Twice: The Video Work of Les Insoumuses (https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/no-woman-can-cook-the-same-meal-twice-the-video-work-of-les-insoumuses)\nThe series Sex, Truth, and Videotape: French Feminist Activism is playing on\nMubi (https://www.imdb.com/company/co0379523/)\nin many countries.

She applies this to Lockhart’s greater body of work, describing Lockhart’s particular ability to allow the coexistence of the subject’s inherent right to self-representation and the artist’s formal impositions,...\nSee full article at MUBI (https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/deragh-campbell-introduces-her-and-sofia-bohdanowicz-s-film-ms-slavic-7)\n6/24/2020\nMUBI (https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/deragh-campbell-introduces-her-and-sofia-bohdanowicz-s-film-ms-slavic-7)\nThe 12th Annual Robert Classic French Film Festival Runs Virtually From July 17th – 23rd (http://www.wearemoviegeeks.com/2020/06/the-12th-annual-robert-classic-french-film-festival-runs-virtually-from-july-17th-23rd/)\n” Je t’aime bien, mon enfant… plus que tu ne crois.

This woman appears in Baxter,\nVera Baxter (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2584833/)\n(1977), solemnly recounting the sallow conditions of her marriage as chirpy luau-inflected music from a neighboring party invades the room; she is in\nNathalie Granger (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4933877/)\n(1972), a film about women whose days are spent in relative silence doing yard work and staring out windows. News of external violence plays on the radio, and the appearance of a bumbling salesman unsettles the drudgery of their daily lives. The films of Marguerite Duras are adept at generating this particular tension, this conflict between the psychic world of the individual and the external one with its countless, unimaginable problems.\nSee full article at MUBI (https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/close-up-on-marguerite-duras-s-india-song)\n4/17/2020\nMUBI (https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/close-up-on-marguerite-duras-s-india-song)\n50 more\nIMDb.com, Inc. takes no responsibility for the content or accuracy of the above news articles, Tweets, or blog posts.

Today, the Brooklyn four-piece has dropped the record’s lead single “Taxes.” Take a listen below.\nThe Brooklyn rockers recorded Getting Killed with producer Kenneth Blume in Los Angeles. “Taxes” opens with metallic drumming and features frontman Cameron Winter’s distinct voice, singing “If you want me to pay my taxes/ You better come over with a crucifix/ You’re gonna have to nail me down.”\nGet Geese Tickets Here\nLater this fall, Geese will kick off the “Getting Killed Tour” which will take the band across North America through October and November (get tickets here).

The iconic talk show host, who led his own eponymous series for decades, visited the Criterion Closet (in the below video) to reminisce about a few of his most beloved films — and most infamous moments on his series.\nCavett recalled how the cast of “Husbands” were some of the most “crappy” guests on “\nThe Dick Cavett Show (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063894/)\n” in 1970. Actors\nPeter Falk (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000393/)\n,\nBen Gazzara (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001262/)\n, and\nJohn Cassavetes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001023/)\n, who also directed the film, appeared on Cavett’s show on September 18, 1970. The trio pretended to faint, stripped off their socks, and had a meandering discussion onstage. Watch it here. Apparently, it was so bad that Cassavetes preemptively blamed whether or not “\nHusbands (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065867/)\n” flopped in theaters on the talk show appearance.\n“That’s the movie that these three guys came on and made total asses of themselves.

Those who think that the dialogue in Orson Welles’\nThe Other Side of the Wind (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069049/)\nis improvised don’t realize that the screenplay by Welles and\nOja Kodar (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0462648/)\nwith that dialogue was published years ago, long before the film’s posthumous completion. It’s worth adding, however, that the film’s mise en scène was improvised by Welles on a daily basis. Similarly, those misled by director\nRobert Altman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000265/)\n’s dreamy pans and seemingly random zooms in\nThe Long Goodbye (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070334/)\ninto concluding that the actors must be inventing their own lines are ignoring the careful work done by screenwriter\nLeigh Brackett (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0102824/)\n, not to mention Raymond Chandler.\nSee full article at MUBI (https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/pleasures-and-perils-improvisation-in-out-1)\n6/21/2020\nMUBI (https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/pleasures-and-perils-improvisation-in-out-1)\n[No Text] (http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/10913-REVIEW-JOHN-CASSAVETES-HUSBANDS-1970;-CRITERION-BLU-RAY-SPECIAL-EDITION.html)\nReview: John Cassavetes' \"Husbands\" (1970); Criterion Blu-ray Special Edition (http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/10913-REVIEW-JOHN-CASSAVETES-HUSBANDS-1970;-CRITERION-BLU-RAY-SPECIAL-EDITION.html)\n[No Text] (http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/10913-REVIEW-JOHN-CASSAVETES-HUSBANDS-1970;-CRITERION-BLU-RAY-SPECIAL-EDITION.html)\nNormal 0 false false false En-us X-none X-none\nBy Todd Garbarini\nThe films of\nJohn Cassavetes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001023/)\nare an acquired taste. Long considered to be the father of the modern independent film movement, his unorthodox style to acting and filmmaking notoriously drove some of his performers crazy while also receiving kudos and accolades from others. Like most filmmakers of his ilk, his work was best seen in independently owned movie theaters in New York City where films generally played for weeks or even months on end to a combination of both rave reviews and decent box office, two ingredients necessary to ensure securing funding for future projects. His directorial debut,\nShadows (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084777/)\n(1958), depicted a romantic relationship between a white man and an African-American woman and the tumult that their relationship brought to their families. The film was unorthodox not only in its subject matter but in its approach to filmmaking.

Indeed it has, and the long-awaited third outing in\nRichard Linklater (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000500/)\n's romantic trilogy finally graces Austin theaters today. Don't miss\nBefore Midnight (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209418/)\n; if the critics are right -- and really, aren't we always? -- the story is as fresh and captivating as ever. (Even I -- who would rather have a root canal than watch most rom-coms -- loved the first two films and can't wait to see the third.)\nIf even the best of rom-coms isn't your thing, there are a surprising number of alternatives this holiday weekend. My top pick is the Austin Film Society \"Spotlight on John Cassavetes\" series, which wraps up with\nHusbands (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065867/)\n, a 1970 tragicomedy starring Cassavetes,\nBen Gazzara (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001262/)\nand\nPeter Falk (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000393/)\nas three middle-age men who mourn a friend's death and live out their midlife crises on a drunken trip to London.\nSee full article at Slackerwood (http://www.slackerwood.com/node/3651)\n5/24/2013\nby Don Clinchy\nSlackerwood (http://www.slackerwood.com/node/3651)\nBen Gazzara: 1930-2012 and Remembering Cassavetes (http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2012/02/ben-gazzara-1930-2012-and-remembering.html)\nWe're sad to report that actor\nBen Gazzara (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001262/)\nhas succumbed to pancreatic cancer at age 81. Over\nGazzara (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2370802/)\n's nearly-sixty year career, his greatest screen moments occurred in collaboration with close friend\nJohn Cassavetes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001023/)\n, along with actors\nPeter Falk (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000393/)\n,\nSeymour Cassel (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001025/)\n, and Cassavetes' wife\nGena Rowlands (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001687/)\n. With Falk's passing last year and now with\nGazzara (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2370802/)\n's, it seems an opportune time to revisit a 2004 chat I had for Venice Magazine with the surviving members of the Cassavetes \"company\" that coincided with Criterion's release of their \"John Cassavetes: Five Films\" collection. Cassel was the only member not present during the conversations, which took place in the home that John and Gena shared from 1962 until his death, and which served as a location for many of their films together.\nRemembering Cassavetes:\nThe Legacy of America’s Most Important Indie Film Pioneer Is Preserved in the Criterion Collection’s New Release\nJohn Cassavetes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001023/)\n:...\nSee full article at The Hollywood Interview (http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2012/02/ben-gazzara-1930-2012-and-remembering.html)\n2/16/2013\nby The Hollywood Interview.com\nThe Hollywood Interview (http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2012/02/ben-gazzara-1930-2012-and-remembering.html)\nThe Worst of 2012: The Movie People Who Passed Away (http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/hollywood-deaths-2012/)\nIt's inevitable that as time goes by, we will lose some of our favorite stars. And yet, year after year, it never gets any easier to look back on the great entertainers who had died over the previous 12 months.\nStill, it's important to remember the legacies of the people who enhanced our own lives over the years with their talent, style and love of cinema. Here's a look at some of the many wonderful Hollywood talents who passed away in 2012.\nWhitney Houston (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001365/)\nOne of the most successful, beloved and influential pop stars of the last quarter century,\nWhitney Houston (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001365/)\nalso became a Hollywood power in the '90s thanks to her roles in blockbusters like \"\nThe Bodyguard (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103855/)\n\" and \"The Preacher's Wife.\" Though she had her very public ups and downs over the past decade, Houston was in the process of making a career comeback on the big screen with the musical \"Sparkle.\nSee full article at NextMovie (http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/hollywood-deaths-2012/)\n12/27/2012\nby Scott Harris\nNextMovie (http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/hollywood-deaths-2012/)\nHusbands – review (http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/30/husbands-review-john-cassavetes-film)\nJohn Cassavetes (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001023/)\ndied in 1989 at the age of 59, having acted in a number of extremely popular mainstream movies (\nMartin Ritt (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0728688/)\n's\nEdge of the City (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050347/)\n,\nRobert Aldrich (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000736/)\n's\nThe Dirty Dozen (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061578/)\n,\nRoman Polanski (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000591/)\n's\nRosemary's Baby (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063522/)\nand\nBrian De Palma (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000361/)\n's\nThe Fury (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077588/)\n), which helped subsidise the freewheeling, semi-improvised independent films on which his reputation ultimately rests. The best of these perhaps, and the least improvised, is\nA Woman Under the Influence (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072417/)\n(1974), for which he (as director) and his wife\nGena Rowlands (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001687/)\n(as best actress) received Oscar nominations.

After the funeral, they go on a monumental 48-hour drinking spree in Manhattan to anaesthetise their grief and fear. After Harry has a fight with his wife and mother-in-law on returning home still drunk, the three then head off for an impulsive break in London – of all the dreary and unpromising places.\nSee full article at The Guardian - Film News (http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/27/husbands-review)\n9/27/2012\nby Peter Bradshaw\nThe Guardian - Film News (http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/27/husbands-review)\n50 more\nIMDb.com, Inc. takes no responsibility for the content or accuracy of the above news articles, Tweets, or blog posts.

(https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0391152/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_1_uname)\nSomeone has to provide the admittedly obvious complaints, so I'll do it (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/reviews/?featured=rw0985472&ref_=tt_ururv_c_1_hd)\nA film that is much more interesting to read about than actually watch. Akerman takes \"realism\" to a new level, basically setting up a camera and observing a very lifeless, dull person for 200 minutes. That woman, played by Delphine Seyrig, is a prostitute, catering to a client a day in her depressing apartment, as well as a single mother. We study her daily rituals as we occasionally glance down at our watches (or push the call button to see how much time is left). Okay, I get it. The problem is, I got it after the first 10 minutes. I got it, really, from reading descriptions of the film. After that, the remaining 190 minutes aren't especially worth sitting through. Notice that even after 190 minutes of breaking taboos of how not to put the audience to sleep, Akerman forces the (literally) climactic sequence. I think I understand what she was going for here, but it's not especially honest given the rest of the film. It shows that even she had to resort to a cheap narrative trick to end the film. All in all, the film is little more than a gimmick. Though I could have been doing better things with my time, I am glad I finally got to see this. I wasn't really bored out of my mind  like Jeanne Dielman, I went through my own daily rituals while glancing up at the screen. Chantal Akerman did make some accurate observations about the human condition after all, even if they are fairly shallow in themselves.\nicivoripmav (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20425766/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_2_uname)\nminimalist depiction of modern life in general, not only feminist! (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/reviews/?featured=rw2010814&ref_=tt_ururv_c_2_hd)\nTo see during 3 and half hours a middle aged woman silently executing the same household works over and over again is one thing. But to realize that this tired looking single mother is virtually cut out of the rest of society and hardly has an occasion of interacting with her fellow citizen, except routinely visiting teenage son and occasional sexual partners, is completely another thing. Once we notice this obvious fact, every act of repetitive domestic task is suddenly becoming painful to contemplate, strangely too familiar for many of us to dismiss simply as monotonous and insipid. All depends on your sensibility to such an existence. Some might find it to be trivial, pretending every woman is more or less supposed to do so since the Creation. Others might spontaneously feel a deep sympathy for her, a prisoner of one's own occupation unable to cope with a deepening void left by the irreversible passage of time, with a growing sense of non-fulfillment.\nApparently, this cinematographic study of housewife's social condition was first intended to be politically engaging at its release, and rightly so, seeing the socio-cultural contexts of 70s. But categorizing it simply as a pioneer of feminist film making, one would miss more essential values this experimental work may embody. If we feel a lingering melancholy and a vague sorrow toward the secluded existence of the protagonist, her solitary acts of peeling vegetables, boiling water, or mechanically making love with men for living... it is probably not because this is a mere depiction of women's status which one hope to be improved in more egalitarian society. We find here something much more deep seated in the modern men's existence in general, namely the social condition of laborers trapped by a particular mode of occupation, gradually and ineluctably losing any clue of human communication as well as the conviction of one's own destiny, without really knowing why.\n10\nedula (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21332396/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_3_uname)\nHypnotic... (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/reviews/?featured=rw2123815&ref_=tt_ururv_c_3_hd)\nI can safely say that I have never seen cinema like this before! Set out over a three-day period, we see widowed mother, Jeanne Dielman, go through her daily routine, many tasks played out in real time, the camera stubbornly static, and often, moreso earlier in the film, at waist-height looking upwards, so that Jeanne's head and shoulders frequently disappear out of shot. At first, watching these actions performed in full seems a touch unnerving - this is something that many people have carried out hundreds of times, but we have never before been forced to pay attention to the monotony of daily chores in such detail. However, holding these shots for so long draws the viewer in even further, making them concentrate on every action, so that when even the smallest cracks appear in Jeanne's monotonous routine, it appears to be almost earth shattering, just as the effect this has on Jeanne is equally momentous.\nThe wonderful Delphine Seyrig here plays Jeanne with an astonishing subtlety and restraint, almost emotionless throughout the three hours and twenty minutes of running time, yet it remains one of the most affecting, powerful performances that I have seen in cinema.\n8\nLigeia313-1 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18907078/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_4_uname)\nA Life of Quiet Desperation (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/reviews/?featured=rw3446703&ref_=tt_ururv_c_4_hd)\nI watched this film forty years after it was made, in a theater in downtown New York City that plays only art films. Still, I was impressed by the audience's rapt attention over the 3 and 1/2 hours of the film. I too was sitting fascinated the entire time. We seemed to understand that a part of the experience of watching it was familiarizing ourselves with the details of the dignified Jeanne's existence. Every piece of furniture in her apartment is viewed over and over, and her daily routine is so minutely reviewed that it is imprinted in the mind; so, any tiny deviation jumps out as a sinister departure portending -- what? You wait worriedly to find out what it could mean. Mostly you feel a great sadness for someone who is clearly desperate to make ends meet financially, so she and her child will be okay. You see a perfectionist at work as she proceeds through the day, as though the great care she is taking shining and folding and washing will somehow result in safety for her and the child. There is a spirituality in this, and it begins to take hold of you, and you fervently hope for her survival.\nkindigth (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19643323/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_5_uname)\nJeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/reviews/?featured=rw2321124&ref_=tt_ururv_c_5_hd)\nAny work of art this preposterously boring can only be considered a failure. Yup, we're going there.\nChantal Akerman's Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is 201 minutes of three days in the life of its titular heroine, played intentionally blank by Delphine Seyrig. That's a run time of about three and a half hours--time Akerman spends following Seyrig's Dielman around doing errands, cooking food, watching a neighbor's baby, sitting around, doing some sex work, and caring for her young adult son. Yeah, sex work is the odd one.\nThe film deserves credit for depicting her sex work as a clean and unsensationalized expression of self-ownership--until of course it throws that all away in the film's stupid sex-is-death conclusion and squanders the only good will it had earned with me. Dielman's relationship with her son is wrapped up in a lot of dated Freudian BS, and rings utterly hollow to those of us living beyond the 1970s. That leaves a whole lot of boring stuff, and that stuff is a whole lot of boring.\nThe bulk of this film consists of a static camera watching a woman do housework. It's like the much-lauded maid scene of Umberto D, but stretched across three excruciating hours. This is presumably meant to be oppressive and disturbing, and here Akerman crucially misunderstands the effect of her art on its audience: the only possible spectatorial response, so far as I can tell, is supreme disengagement. Just as I daydream when I do housework, so does my mind wander while watching Jeanne Dielman of 23 quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles cook the potatoes. People retreat to their thoughts when they do this stuff in real life, and they retreat when you faithfully reproduce it on screen. The film can't possibly engage me politically or emotionally as art if I'm spending the entire run time thinking about whether I get paid this Friday and what I'm going to cook for dinner.\nThe question is, is Akerman aware of the human proclivity toward idle thought during mundane tasks? Because this film is only oppressive and uncomfortable if it's empty, if this woman doesn't dream then this numbing boredom could have something to say. But that doesn't work: we all think all the time, we all daydream. Does Jeanne Dielman of 23 quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles daydream? Presumably so, but the film is so damned externalized that I have no idea what she's thinking. And without her thoughts to guide me through these three and a half irretrievable hours of my one wild and precious life, I'm left with my own.\nAs such, Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles's conclusion is spectacularly unmotivated and completely unearned. The finale is entirely unsupported by its previous action because this was, for me, a film about what type of sandwich I'll eat when I get home and what's going on this weekend. -TK 10/7/10\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071690/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n6.6\nI, You, He, She (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071690/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078152/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n7.3\nMeetings with Anna (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078152/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216605/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n6.0\nThe Captive (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216605/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076452/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n7.3\nNews from Home (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076452/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_4)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055852/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_5)\n7.8\nCléo from 5 to 7 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055852/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_5)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209933/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_6)\n7.3\nBeau Travail (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209933/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_6)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063551/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_7)\n6.3\nSaute ma ville (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063551/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_7)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071141/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_8)\n8.0\nAli: Fear Eats the Soul (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071141/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_8)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092219/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_9)\n6.8\nGolden Eighties (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092219/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_9)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6723660/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_10)\n7.3\nAutour de Jeanne Dielman (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6723660/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_10)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048452/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_11)\n8.2\nOrdet (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048452/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_11)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067961/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_12)\n7.1\nWanda (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067961/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_12)\nStoryline (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198#storyline)\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt0073198/storyline&ref_=tt_stry)\nDid you know\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt0073198/fun-facts&tt_dyk)\nTrivia (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/trivia/?ref_=tt_dyk_trv)\nJeanne Dielman's obsessive and exacting ritualistic behavior was inspired by director\nChantal Akerman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001901/?ref_=dyk_trv)\n's mother,\nNatalia Akerman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0015197/?ref_=dyk_trv)\n.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/trivia/?ref_=tt_dyk_trv)\nGoofs (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/goofs/?tab=gf&ref_=tt_dyk_gf)\nFrom around 01:11:18 to 01:11:36, we can see the boom mic on right of the frame.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/goofs/?tab=gf&ref_=tt_dyk_gf)\nQuotes (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/quotes/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\nSylvain Dielman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0213964/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\n:\n[Referring to his dead father]\nIf he was ugly, did you want to make love with him?\nJeanne Dielman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0786891/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\n: Ugly or not, it wasn't all that important.

Once (https://movieweb.com/the-three-colors-trilogy-must-watch/)\nThe Three Colors Trilogy, directed by\nKrzysztof Kieślowski (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001425/)\n, explores themes of liberty, equality, and fraternity through a visually stunning and emotionally rich cinematic experience. Each movie in the trilogy delves deep into its respective color symbol and dissects the issues related to it, offering a powerful meditation on the human condition. The trilogy's cinematography plays a crucial role in setting the tone and conveying the messages, using color palettes and visual motifs to enhance the overall experience.\nThe Three Colors Trilogy is one of the most stylish and sensitive unofficial trilogies out there, standing on the same level as Linklater's highly romantic Before trilogy. These films are directed by Polish arthouse filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski, also known for\nThe Double Life of Véronique (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101765/)\nand the\nDekalog (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092337/)\nminiseries, which ,similarly to the Three Colors Trilogy, establishes a powerful allegory by meditating on each of the Ten Commandments throughout 10 distinct episodes.\nThe Three...\nSee full article at MovieWeb (https://movieweb.com/the-three-colors-trilogy-must-watch/)\n9/19/2023\nby Arthur Goyaz\nMovieWeb (https://movieweb.com/the-three-colors-trilogy-must-watch/)\n[No Text] (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/woman-of-review-malgorzata-szumowska-michal-englert-1235585400/)\n‘Woman Of…’ Review: Malgorzata Szumowska’s Affecting Character Study Rescues Polish Trans People From the Invisible Margins (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/woman-of-review-malgorzata-szumowska-michal-englert-1235585400/)\n[No Text] (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/woman-of-review-malgorzata-szumowska-michal-englert-1235585400/)\nWith her enigmatically titled Woman Of… (\nKobieta z..

As with anything in the early stages of my cinephilia, that baptism had been her idea. The movie theatre we’d pay weekly pilgrimages to had allocated a whole three-day run to The Decalogue (1989), and she thought that Kieślowski’s Ten Commandments TV saga would be a good place to start.

The characters are quite interesting in themselves, and the story brings out some worthwhile aspects of each of their natures while giving a realistic and often fascinating look at their world.\nBy no means do you have to be a ballet fan to appreciate and enjoy the story or the settings. While fully convincing in themselves, they are also set up so that the most important aspects and conflicts of the plot could easily be applied to those working in other creative fields as well.\nMoira Shearer, Anton Walbrook, and Marius Goring make a nicely balanced and intriguing trio of main characters. The opening scenes work very well in bringing them together while being enjoyable to watch in themselves. From there, the creative tensions are built up steadily as the story itself becomes even more interesting. The script makes use of the best conventions of its genre, while never allowing itself to become formulaic.\nThere is also a good deal of creativity in many of the individual sequences. The opening scene at the opera is particularly clever in playing off of a viewer's initial expectations. The most spectacular sequence is the \"red shoes\" ballet segment itself, a very imaginative and enjoyable mini-movie that also parallels some of the main story's most interesting ideas. All in all, \"The Red Shoes\" well deserves its reputation as a distinctive classic.\n9\nbkoganbing (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2483625/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_2_uname)\nStriving to be the best (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040725/reviews/?featured=rw3321630&ref_=tt_ururv_c_2_hd)\nI guess the lesson to be learned is that when one is in the arts and striving to be the best it demands 100% of you. At least that's the lesson I took away from The Red Shoes. The film itself is a reworking of the plot from Maytime with dance instead of singing as the art form.\nMoira Shearer plays aspiring ballerina Victoria Page and her talent is immediately recognized by ballet impresario Anton Walbrook. He takes her under his wing, but Walbrook seems to want to control every aspect of her life. Walbrook also gives a break to young composer Marius Goring whom he hires to help orchestrate the music that the dancer's use. Goring is talented but also quite full of himself as well. Soon enough Shearer and Goring fall in love and that does not fit into the long range plans Walbrook has.\nThe title comes from a story by Hans Christian Andersen about a ballerina who sees a pair of red ballet slippers and puts them on and she can dance better than anyone has before. But The Red Shoes have their own enchantment, you can't stop dancing once they're on. The ballerina arranges for her feet to be cut off to stop dancing.\nThe ballet is an allegory for the terrible price one of these three has to pay for art's sake. The ballet itself which we see in its entirety is maybe the best ballet sequence ever brought to the big screen. Pieces of other classic ballet numbers are also scattered throughout the film and are woven and completely integrated into the plot.\nThough John Barrymore who was the manager and husband of Jeanette Macdonald in Maytime was no longer available, Anton Walbrook got his career role out of playing Boris Lermontov who constantly walks back and forth over the line between dedication and obsession. Marius Goring is far from Nelson Eddy in this, he's ambitious and wants it all wife and career. To the extent that Shearer is also in the arts, he wants her in no small part to support his ambitions. In fact he becomes as unlikeable as Walbrook. Torn between these two men it is no wonder Shearer meets the fate she does.\nWonderful ballet sequences splendidly photographed by Jack Cardiff and well tuned acting performances by the three leads are the hallmark of The Red Shoes. This one is a timeless classic.\n10\nHugh-14 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0284579/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_3_uname)\nP&P's Masterpiece (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040725/reviews/?featured=rw0038863&ref_=tt_ururv_c_3_hd)\nI have seen this film about 30 times in 30 years and for me this film will always be special. Astonishingly, my wife, who is a Ballet Teacher, doesn't care at all for this film finding it too 'affected'. Perhaps as I am not involved with ballet at a professional level is a reason why I can enjoy this vibrant, colourful fantasy so much, but then our ballet friends adore the film, so who knows why this film affects some so profoundly (Spielberg&Scorsese!!) and not others. Anton Walbrook's authoritative performance is so memorable and Moira Shearer dances beautifully. Perhaps because the film is so highly charged with passion and emotion it will never please everyone, but I feel this is one of the great achievements of British Cinema and a film so rich and inspirational you will never wish to forget it.\n10\nSpleen (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0035229/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_4_uname)\nOne of the few films impossible to over-praise (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040725/reviews/?featured=rw0038870&ref_=tt_ururv_c_4_hd)\nThe film isn't THAT closely related to Hans Christian Andersen's story; but it would be a good idea to read the story before seeing the film.  It's one of Andersen's better stories, anyway.\nAnother minor note: if no other consideration will sway you, see `The Red Shoes' for a perceptive look the position of the ballet composer relative to that of the dancers.  For Powell and Pressburger it's no more than a diverting side issue, but it's one of the things that especially interested me.  If you look at advertisements for ballet productions today, you'll notice that the composer's name is NEVER printed - even if the ballet is called `Cinderella' and the public has no way of working out whose score is being used.  It puts the composer in his place, no doubt.  Yet musicians at the ballet are in the habit of thinking that they're the most important people there.\nI'm on their side.  I happen to loathe classical ballet as such.  `Swan Lake' strikes me as a lovely score disfigured by people who insist on dancing to it.  Yet `The Red Shoes' makes me put all of this aside.  Indeed, it would be fair to say that I simply CAN'T dislike ballet while watching the film - which is especially odd, considering some of the things it does to people.\nSo, yes, if `The Red Shoes' can have this effect on ME, of all people, it's surely one of the best films ever made.  I can't agree at all with the people who describe the film as `melodrama' or `camp'.  (The latter charge I scarcely even understand.)  The story is what it is and it's told at the most realistic and sincere level appropriate.  The characters who act theatrically (NOT melodramatically) are all creatures of the theatre, and have not spent not just their days but their lives in Lermontov's troupe. If you want a more understated view of things then watch the musicians.  To put in a word for one of them, Brian Easdale's source music is superb: GOOD music of a kind that an English composer like Craster might well be expected to write.  It's clear that Easdale wrote Craster's compositions first, and then constructed the rest of the score around them, rather than vice versa.\n10\nHermit C-2 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0249396/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_5_uname)\n(Top 10 pick) A superior film. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040725/reviews/?featured=rw0038865&ref_=tt_ururv_c_5_hd)\nI first heard of \"The Red Shoes\" when I read the liner notes to an album by the jazz/fusion group Weather Report, called \"Tale Spinnin'\". Therein it said that saxophonist Wayne Shorter had seen the film a few dozen times. Intrigued, I watched it when I noticed it in the TV listings. What a discovery!\nWith its focus on the tangle of lives of a ballerina, a composer, and a dictatorial impresario who uses them both, the story may have elements of a soap opera, but it's a superior soap opera. What appealed to Shorter, I'm sure, is the film's depiction of the artists' creative process. It may have been done better elsewhere, but I haven't seen it. Besides that, it's beautifully directed, beautifully photographed and sumptuous to look at throughout. The surreal title ballet is performed in a segment that is stunning, and I'm not just using that word as a cliche.\nAnton Walbrook stands out as Lermontov, leader of the ballet troupe. There are many real-life artists from the ballet world in the film, including Leonide Massine and Robert Helpmann. Massine is particularly effective.\nDon't be put off by the notion that this is some effete art film; it's high quality AND accessible. Anyone who enjoys art (especially ballet), romance or just plain good moviemaking owes it to themselves to see it.\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039192/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n7.7\nBlack Narcissus (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039192/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038733/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n8.0\nA Matter of Life and Death (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038733/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036112/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n8.0\nThe Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036112/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054167/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n7.6\nPeeping Tom (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054167/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_4)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044103/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_5)\n7.1\nThe Tales of Hoffmann (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044103/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_5)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037558/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_6)\n8.0\nBrief Encounter (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037558/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_6)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036695/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_7)\n7.3\nA Canterbury Tale (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036695/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_7)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037800/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_8)\n7.4\nI Know Where I'm Going!

(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032155/reviews/?featured=rw1408077&ref_=tt_ururv_c_1_hd)\n1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in Hollywood history, with more classic films released than in any other, and John Ford directed three of the best, \"Stagecoach\", \"Drums Along the Mohawk\", and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the Union, \"Young Mr. Lincoln\".\nWith the world plunging into a war that America dreaded, but knew it would be drawn into, Abraham Lincoln was much on people's minds, in 1939, as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life, and had triumphed. On Broadway, Robert E. Sherwood's award-winning \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\", with Raymond Massey's physically dead-on portrayal, was playing to packed houses (it would be filmed in 1940). Carl Sandburg's continuation of his epic biography, \"Abraham Lincoln: The War Years\", was published, and quickly became a best seller. President Roosevelt frequently referred to Lincoln in speeches, and the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, D.C., became the most popular landmark in town (a fact that Frank Capra made good use of, in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\").\nAll this was not lost on Darryl F. Zanuck, at 20th Century Fox; as soon as he read Lamar Trotti's screenplay of Lincoln's early days as a lawyer, he designated it a 'prestige' production, and assigned John Ford to direct, and Henry Fonda, to star.\nFonda did NOT want to play Lincoln; he felt he couldn't do justice to the 'Great Emancipator', and feared a bad performance would damage his career. Even a filmed make-up test, in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble Lincoln, wouldn't change his mind. According to Fonda, John Ford, whom he'd never worked with, cussed him out royally, at their first meeting, and explained he wasn't portraying the Lincoln of Legend, but a young \"jackanape\" country lawyer facing his first murder trial. Humbled, Fonda took the role. (John Ford offered a different scenario of the events, but the outcome was the same!) Obviously, they found a chemistry together that worked, as nearly all of their pairings would produce 'classics'.\nUnlike the introverted, melancholia-racked Lincoln of \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\", Ford's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney, who made friends easily, and misses the mother he lost, too young (resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story). Injustice riles him, and he speaks 'common sense' to quell violence, interlaced with doses of humor. Both productions play on Lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with Ann Rutledge; in Ford's version, the pair are truly in love, and committed to each other. After her death, Lincoln would frequently visit her grave, to share his life with her 'spirit' (a theme Ford would continue in \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\").\nA murder trial is the centerpiece of the film, and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director. Fonda deftly portrays Lincoln's inexperience, yet earnest belief in justice tempered with mercy, and Ford emphasizes the gulf between the big-city 'intellectuals' (represented by pompous D.A. Donald Meek, and his slick 'advisor', Stephen Douglas, played by a young Milburn Stone), and the informal, rule-bending country sense of Lincoln. With Ford 'regular' Ward Bond as a key witness, the trial is both unconventional, and riveting.\nWith the film closing as Lincoln strides away into the stormy distance, and his destiny (dissolving into a view of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial), audiences could take comfort in the film's message that if a cause is just, good would ultimately triumph.\n\"Young Mr. Lincoln\" is a truly remarkable film, from an amazing year!\n9\nbkoganbing (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2483625/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_2_uname)\nA Jackleg Prarie Lawyer (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032155/reviews/?featured=rw1168941&ref_=tt_ururv_c_2_hd)\nYoung Mr. Lincoln marks the first film of the director/star collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I recall years ago Fonda telling that as a young actor he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and scared he wouldn't live up to the challenge.\nJohn Ford before the shooting starts put him at ease by saying he wasn't going to be playing the Great Emancipator, but just a jack-leg prairie lawyer. That being settled Fonda headed a cast that John Ford directed into a classic film.\nThis is not a biographical film of Lincoln. That had come before in the sound era with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey did the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey still remains the definitive Lincoln.\nBut as Ford said, Fonda wasn't playing the Great Emancipator just a small town lawyer in Illinois. The film encompasses about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We see him clerking in a general store, getting some law books from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he would cross again later in the story. And his romance with Ann Rutledge with her early death leaving Lincoln a most melancholy being.\nFast forward about 10 years and Lincoln is now a practicing attorney beginning to get some notice. He's served a couple of terms in the legislature, but he's back in private practice not really sure if politics is for him.\nThis is where the bulk of the action takes place. The two sons of that family he'd gotten the law books from way back when are accused of murder. He offers to defend them. And not an ordinary murder but one of a deputy sheriff.\nThe trial itself is fiction, but the gambit used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan who played the two sons is based on a real case Lincoln defended. I'll say no more.\nOther than the performances, the great strength of Young Mr. Lincoln is the way John Ford captures the mood and atmosphere and setting of a small Illinois prairie town in a Fourth of July celebration. It's almost like you're watching a newsreel. And it was the mood of the country itself, young, vibrant and growing.\nFans of John Ford films will recognize two musical themes here that were repeated in later films. During the romantic interlude at the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore who played Ann Rutledge the music in the background is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And at a dance, the tune Lovely Susan Brown that Fonda and Marjorie Weaver who plays Mary Todd is the same one Fonda danced with Cathy Downs to, in My Darling Clementine at the dance for the raising of a church in Tombstone.\nLincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and dramatists because of two reasons, I believe. The first is he's the living embodiment of our own American mythology about people rising from the very bottom to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts. In fact Young Mr. Lincoln very graphically shows the background Lincoln came from. And secondly the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made a singularly good and moral decision to free slaves during the Civil War, albeit for some necessary political reasons. His assassination assured his place in history.\nBesides Fonda and others I've mentioned special praise should also go to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the two town louts, Kohler being the murder victim and Bond the chief accuser. Also Donald Meek as the prosecuting attorney and Alice Brady in what turned out to be her last film as the pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very nice performance by Spencer Charters who specialized in rustic characters as the judge.\nFor a film that captures the drama and romance of the time it's set in, you can't do better than Young Mr. Lincoln.\n10\ncoop-16 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0270026/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_3_uname)\nSymbol, history, and myth. (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032155/reviews/?featured=rw0021070&ref_=tt_ururv_c_3_hd)\nIn his otherwise excellent book, Lincoln in American Memory, the historian Merrill Peterson calls Young Mr.Lincoln a \"boring, dreadful, film\". This amazingly wrongheaded analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics. I am working on a doctoral dissertation on Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. As part of my preparation for writing the dissertation, I made  a careful analysis of this film, and of Tag Gallaghers brilliant interpretation of it in his seminal book on Ford. Young Mr. Lincoln comes out that culminating year of the first phase of Ford's cinematic authorship, 1939.In that greatest of Hollywood years, Ford directed three superb, still not fully appreciated films: Drums Along the Mohawk, Stagecoach,and Young Mr.Lincoln. It might seem odd to say that Stagecoach is not fully appreciated, all but the most purblind of critics must perceive that it is one of of the greatest Westerns, and perhaps even one of the hundred greatest films of all time. However, what is NOT fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a kind of trilogy-a triptych, in fact. Ford is creating a sort of mythic history of America on screen. Drums Along the Mohawk is the Revolutionary War. Young Mr.Lincoln is pre-Civil War America.Finally, Stagecoach is Post Civil War America. What the three films have in common is that they are an extended meditation on the American Adam and his \"errand into the Wilderness\". What are the Psychic and social costs of American manifest destiny, as America strives to build a new human city in the wilderness?Lincoln symbolizes Americas journey, as he seeks to reconcile the civilizational inmpulse (law), with the freedom of the wilderness.Young Mr.Lincoln is not history, ( It is  full of historical \"howlers'-as both Ford and Trotti were well aware), but myth. This is Lincoln, the symbol of justice and mercy, Lincoln, the man of the wilderness, striving to found a civilization within himself, and to become the \"remarkable  lawgiver' of young America. Young Mr. Lincoln is not history-like James Agee's long forgotten teleplay about Lincoln, and like Sandburgs biography, it is an epic poem...a very beautiful epic poem.\n9\nBunuel1976 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1399158/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_4_uname)\nYOUNG MR. LINCOLN (John Ford, 1939) ***1/2 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032155/reviews/?featured=rw1361238&ref_=tt_ururv_c_4_hd)\nThis film was not only one of John Ford's own personal favorites but also numbered directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among its high-profile admirers. Ironically, I've just caught up with it myself via Criterion's recent 2-Disc Set after missing out on a couple of original language screenings of it on Italian TV many years ago and again a few times on TV while in Hollywood!\nThe film marked Ford's first of nine collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also a quintessential example of Ford's folksy Americana vein. A beautifully made and pictorially quite poetic piece of work, the courtroom sequences (and eventual revelation) in its second half still pack quite a wallop, apart from giving stalwart character actor Donald Meek a memorably meaty role as the prosecuting attorney.\nFonda is, of course, perfectly cast as a bashful, inexperienced but rigorous and humanistic lawyer who was destined to become President; Fonda would go on to portray other fictitious politicians on film - most notably in Franklin J. Schaffner's THE BEST MAN (1964) and Sidney Lumet's FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and it's surprising now to learn that he was reluctant at the time about accepting the role of Lincoln since, in his view, that was \"like playing God\"!\nIt is interesting to note here that Ford had previously tackled Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) in THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND (1936), a superb but perhaps little-known gem which has, luckily, just been released as a Special Edition DVD by the UK's veritable Criterion stand-in, Eureka's \"Masters Of Cinema\" label. Besides, I also have two more Abraham Lincoln films in my DVD collection which I've yet to watch and, incidentally, both were directed by D. W. Griffith - THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and, had I not just received a bunch of films I've never watched before just now, I would have gladly given them a spin based on my highly-satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.\n9\ncraig_smith9 (https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0543650/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_5_uname)\nYoung Henry Fonda is young Mr. Lincoln (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032155/reviews/?featured=rw0021072&ref_=tt_ururv_c_5_hd)\nHenry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like.  It is a fooler.  Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin.  But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him.\nIn this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor.  It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect.  There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard.  He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.\nThe ending by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War.  He goes forward into history.  The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is tremendous.  Definitely worth seeing again.\nMore like this\n[No Text] (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/discover-watch/what-is-the-more-like-this-section/GPE7SPGZREKKY7YN?ref_=cons_tt_rec_lm)\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038762/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_1)\n7.7\nMy Darling Clementine (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038762/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_1)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031252/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_2)\n7.0\nDrums Along the Mohawk (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031252/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_2)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043117/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_3)\n7.1\nWagon Master (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043117/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_3)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040369/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_4)\n7.4\nFort Apache (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040369/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_4)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038160/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_5)\n7.2\nThey Were Expendable (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038160/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_5)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031971/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_6)\n7.8\nStagecoach (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031971/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_6)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071733/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_7)\n7.6\nLacombe, Lucien (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071733/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_7)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4936450/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_8)\n7.3\nGraduation (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4936450/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_8)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026529/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_9)\n7.3\nThe Informer (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026529/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_9)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1173745/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_10)\n7.5\nRevanche (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1173745/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_10)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041866/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_11)\n7.2\nShe Wore a Yellow Ribbon (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041866/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_11)\nWatchlist\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032728/?ref_=tt_mlt_i_12)\n6.9\nThe Long Voyage Home (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032728/?ref_=tt_mlt_t_12)\nWatchlist\nStoryline (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032155#storyline)\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt0032155/storyline&ref_=tt_stry)\nDid you know\nEdit (https://contribute.imdb.com/updates?edit=tt0032155/fun-facts&tt_dyk)\nTrivia (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032155/trivia/?ref_=tt_dyk_trv)\nJohn Ford (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000406/?ref_=dyk_trv)\nand producer\nDarryl F.

That portion of the film is ostensibly set in the year 1837, but most reliable sources indicate that \"Dixie\" wasn't written, publicly performed nor published before 1859. During the Civil War, Lincoln was known to be partial to the tune (it was almost as popular in the North in the 1860s as in the South), but it's unlikely he would have heard it in the 1830s.\n[No Text] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032155/goofs/?tab=gf&ref_=tt_dyk_gf)\nQuotes (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032155/quotes/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\nAbe Lincoln (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000020/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu)\n:\n[cross-examining Cass]\nJ.

With music by\nZbigniew Preisner (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006237/)\n, it is an almost supernatural contrivance: brooding on coincidence, fate and the insoluble mystery of other people’s lives, with some cosmic parallels and existential echoes that recall his earlier film\nThe Double Life of Véronique (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101765/)\n. And all in a tone somehow both playful and laden with gnomic seriousness.\nAt its centre is Valentine, played by\nIrène Jacob (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001393/)\n, a model who has a job posing for a chewing gum billboard campaign; her image is to dominate the city streets and she briefly achieves a kind of anonymous celebrity – a part of the story which makes Three Colours: Red a New Wave sort of film.\nSee full article at The Guardian - Film News (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/11/three-colours-red-review-kieslowski)\n4/11/2023\nby Peter Bradshaw\nThe Guardian - Film News (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/11/three-colours-red-review-kieslowski)\n[No Text] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/three-colours-white-review-kieslowski-julie-delpy-black-comedy-gangster-capitalism)\nThree Colours: White review – Kieslowski’s expert black comedy of gangster capitalism (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/three-colours-white-review-kieslowski-julie-delpy-black-comedy-gangster-capitalism)\n[No Text] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/three-colours-white-review-kieslowski-julie-delpy-black-comedy-gangster-capitalism)\nThe middle film in the Colours trilogy features\nJulie Delpy (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000365/)\nas it takes a dagger to both France and Poland’s conception of equality and meritocracy\nThis is the second movie in Krzystztof Kieslowski’s great Colours trilogy, now on rerelease; here white is the colour of death, the colour of winter, the colour of orgasm and also the colour of a clean slate and a fresh start about to be muddied and spoiled. Theoretically, it addresses not just the middle colour of the French flag, but the second tenet of the revolution as well – equality – which it does by dramatising some outrageous inequality. It also satirises the specious new equality and meritocracy of gangster capitalism, on the rise in post-Soviet Poland.\nWorking again with composer\nZbigniew Preisner (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006237/)\n, Kieslowski audaciously jolts the tone away from the dreamy, tragic and cosmic loneliness of Blue to a vinegary black comedy of marital breakdown,...\nSee full article at The Guardian - Film News (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/three-colours-white-review-kieslowski-julie-delpy-black-comedy-gangster-capitalism)\n4/5/2023\nby Peter Bradshaw\nThe Guardian - Film News (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/three-colours-white-review-kieslowski-julie-delpy-black-comedy-gangster-capitalism)\n[No Text] (https://trailersfromhell.com/podcast/todd-field/)\nTodd Field (https://trailersfromhell.com/podcast/todd-field/)\n[No Text] (https://trailersfromhell.com/podcast/todd-field/)\nTár writer/director\nTodd Field (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0276062/)\ndiscusses a few of his favorite movies with\nJosh Olson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0647939/)\nand\nJoe Dante (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001102/)\n.\nShow Notes: Movies Referenced In This Episode\nYou Only Live Twice (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062512/)\n(1967) –\nDana Gould (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0332344/)\n’s trailer commentary\nTár (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14444726/)\n(2022)\nMan With A Movie Camera (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019760/)\n(1929)\nBattleship Potemkin (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015648/)\n(1925)\nKoyaanisqatsi (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085809/)\n(1982)\nThe Big Parade (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015624/)\n(1925)\nLawrence Of Arabia (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056172/)\n(1962)\nThe Crowd (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018806/)\n(1928)\nStar Wars (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/)\n(1977)\nThe Servant (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1905059/)\n(1963)\nParasite (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/)\n(2019) –\nGlenn Erickson (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002063/)\n’s Blu-ray review,\nDennis Cozzalio (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5606549/)\n’s review\nThe Three Musketeers (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072281/)\n(1973) – Josh Olson’s trailer commentary\nFigures In A Landscape (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065720/)\n(1970)\nM (1931)\nM (1951)\nI Am Cuba (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058604/)\n(1964)\nThe Cranes Are Flying (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050634/)\n(1957) – Glenn Erickson’s Criterion Blu-ray review\nLetter Never Sent (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053106/)\n(1960)\nShadows of Forgotten Ancestors (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058642/)\n(1965)\nButch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064115/)\n(1969)\nThe Towering Inferno (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072308/)\n(1974) –\nGeorge Hickenlooper (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382584/)\n’s trailer commentary\nThe Great Waldo Pepper (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073075/)\n(1975)\nThe Sting (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070735/)\n(1973)\nThe World of Henry Orient (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058756/)\n(1964) –\nLarry Karaszewski (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0438989/)\n’s trailer commentary\nThelma And Louise (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103074/)\n(1991)\nMurmur Of The Heart (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067778/)\n(1971)\nThe Silent World (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049518/)\n(1956)\nOpening Night (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079672/)\n(1977)\nThe Killing Of A Chinese Bookie (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074749/)\n(1976) – Larry Karaszewski’s...\nSee full article at Trailers from Hell (https://trailersfromhell.com/podcast/todd-field/)\n1/10/2023\nby Kris Millsap\nTrailers from Hell (https://trailersfromhell.com/podcast/todd-field/)\n[No Text] (https://trailersfromhell.com/europa-europa/)\nEuropa Europa (https://trailersfromhell.com/europa-europa/)\n[No Text] (https://trailersfromhell.com/europa-europa/)\nDirector\nAgnieszka Holland (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002140/)\npulls off a difficult task — her true-life Holocaust tale neither trivializes the horror nor glamorizes individualized victims at the expense of the big picture.\nMarco Hofschneider (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0389424/)\nis the inexperienced German teenager who by strange quirks of fate becomes a staunch Stalinist in a Communist school, then a Nazi war hero and candidate for Hitler Youth honors and adoption by a Nazi officer… if he can avoid being uncovered as a Jew in hiding.

There are too many things in the world that divide people, such as religion, politics, history, and nationalism. If culture is capable of anything, then it is finding that which unites us all. And there are so many things that unite people. It doesn't matter who you are or who I am, if your tooth aches or mine; it's still the same pain. Feelings are what link people together, because the word 'love' has the same meaning for everybody. Or 'fear', or 'suffering'. We all fear the same way and the same things.

As we all do, I was a bit concerned that perhaps my memory of these films had been enhanced with time, but I found the opposite — they’re even better with age and stand as one of the best film achievements of not just their era but of all time. I can’t say enough about Kieslowski’s talent as a director and, while some may point to the “Decalogue” films or “\nThe Double Life of Veronique (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101765/)\n,” I’ve always considered “Three Colors” to be the greatest accomplishment of one of history’s greatest directors.

The films — Blue (1993), White (1993) and Red (1994) — were named for the colors of the French flag and stand for the tenets of the French Revolution: liberty, equality and fraternity. But that only hints at the film’s beauty, richness and humanity.\nSet in Paris, Warsaw and Geneva, Blue, White, and Red (Kieślowski’s final film) range from tragedy to drama to comedy.

Preisner, who was twice nominated for a Golden Globe for his scores to\nThree Colors: Blue (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108394/)\nand\nAt Play in the Fields of The Lord (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101373/)\n, was awarded a special Berlin Silver Bear for outstanding single achievement in 1997 for his music to\nSoren Kragh-Jacobsen (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0469273/)\n's\nThe Island on Bird Street (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119389/)\n. In addition to his work on\nOcean's Eleven (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/)\nand the upcoming sequel\nOcean's Twelve (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349903/)\n, Holmes composed the score for\nGregor Jordan (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0429964/)\n's controversial\nBuffalo Soldiers (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252299/)\n, which was shot almost entirely in Germany. Talent Campus organizers on Friday also announced they have selected 520 young filmmakers from 84 countries to attend this year's event. The group was chosen from more than 3600 applications. The theme of this year's Talent Campus is film sound and music. In addition to Holmes and Preisner, other hosts include director\nAnthony Minghella (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005237/)\n, sound and film editor\nWalter Murch (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004555/)\n, screenwriter/producer\nEleanor Bergstein (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0075044/)\nand directors\nNicolas Philibert (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0679928/)\n,\nAlan Parker (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000570/)\nand\nWim Wenders (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000694/)\n.\n1/16/2004\nThe Hollywood Reporter - Movie News\nFilm review: 'Fairytale -- a True Story'\n\"Fairy tales can come true, they can happen to you -- if you're young at heart.\" That vaunted lyric sums up the theme of this wonderfully whimsical tale of two young girls who stunned the world in 1917 when they photographed a fairy in their summer garden.\nA captivating children's film, this Paramount release is an appealing winner. Likely to be praised by critics, teachers and arts-council types, the only reservation one has about this ethereal gem is whether its sophisticated abstractions will connect with flesh-and-blood children.\nAlas, it seems more like a movie outing for Hillary and Chelsea than one for the kids in the neighborhood. Paramount will likely find the biggest fans for this film are adults who are young at heart and appreciate the film's celebration of the magical powers of innocence.\nIn this auspicious storytelling, screenwriter\nErnie Contreras (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0176497/)\nhas distilled the bare facts of two young girls' photographing a fairy and spun them around the events and thinking of the day. Incredibly, this true story lured into its philosophical midst such figures as illusionist/escape artist\nHarry Houdini (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396378/)\n(\nHarvey Keitel (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000172/)\n) and the venerable Sir\nArthur Conan Doyle (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0236279/)\n(Peter O'Toole). Contreras' scenario is well-founded and appealing, grounded in the basic kids' complaint that adults never take them seriously.\nIn essence, we see that adults are too serious to comprehend the real wonders of existence. The storytelling is also keenly flecked with one girl's belief that her father, who has been declared missing in action in World War I, will someday return.\nCharles Sturridge (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0836430/)\n's kindly directorial wand conjures up the spry and supple theme, never dwelling on didactic points or overreaching in either tenor or tone. It's a gentle tale, graced with humorous dollops. The two lead girls are well-chosen.\nFlorence Hoath (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387524/)\n's graceful, intelligent performance as 13-year-old Elsie is a high point and 10-year-old\nElizabeth Earl (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0247232/)\nshows some real moxie and poise as the headstrong Frances.\nThe supporting performances are all top-drawer. O'Toole brings luster as the master of deduction, Conan Doyle, while Keitel imbues his Houdini character with credible scrappiness.\nFittingly, the technical contributions are magical. Michael Coulter's lush cinematography,\nZbigniew Preisner (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006237/)\n's captivating compositions and Michael Howell's inviting production design are of the highest quality.\nFAIRYTALE - A TRUE STORY\nParamount Pictures\nIcon Prods./Wendy Finerman Prods.\nProducer\nWendy Finerman (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0277704/)\n, Bruce Davey\nDirector Charles Sturridge\nScreenwriter Ernie Contreras\nCo-producers/co-story\nAlbert Ash (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038611/)\n,\nTom Loughlin\nExecutive producer Paul Tucker\nCo-producer Selwyn Roberts\nAssociate producer\nMargaret French (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0294140/)\nIsaac\nDirector of photography Mike Coulter\nProduction designer Michael Howells\nEditor Peter Coulson\nMusic Zbigniew Preisner\nCostume designer Shirley Russell\nVisual effects supervisor Tim Webber\nColor/stereo\nCast:\nElsie Wright Florence Hoath\nFrances Griffiths (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0341671/)\nElizabeth Earl\nArthur Wright Paul McGann\nPolly Wright (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942715/)\nPhoebe Nicholls\nSir\nArthur Conan Doyle (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0236279/)\nPeter O'Toole\nHarry Houdini (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396378/)\nHarvey Keitel\nRunning time -- 98 minutes...\n9/12/1997\nThe Hollywood Reporter - Movie News\nIMDb.com, Inc. takes no responsibility for the content or accuracy of the above news articles, Tweets, or blog posts.
