A guiding principle of economic policy is the free market system, that is, to allow market forces to determine the pattern of trade. The Singapore Government seeks to ensure that the trading system is open and transparent. Customs and trade documentation procedures are streamlined for smooth flow of goods in and out of Singapore. Singapore does not have any sector-specific policies or trade instruments to promote exports.\n\nThe private sector is encouraged to play a leading role in economic development while the Government provides an environment conducive for private sector business activities. Fiscal policy is aimed at supporting the private sector in economic development. On the revenue side, the objective is to raise sufficient revenue to finance expenditure while maintaining a competitive tax structure. The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax from April 1994 was to enhance competitiveness of Singapore’s tax structure.\n\nOn the expenditure side, efforts are made to maintain a small and efficient public sector to release maximum financial and manpower resources to the private sector. Hence, certain operations are being privatised to give them greater autonomy to be run according to commercial practices. This includes telecommunications, broadcasting, electricity and gas etc.\n\nThe privatization programme in Singapore was undertaken to achieve the following objectives:|\n\n1.   to withdraw from commercial activities which no longer need to be undertaken by the public sector;\n2.   to add breadth and depth to the Singapore stock market by the flotation of government linked companies and statutory boards and through secondary distribution of government-owned shares;\n3.   to avoid or reduce competition with the private sector;\n4.   to improve efficiency of services through market discipline; and\n5.   to increase the assets of Singaporeans through share ownership in the privatised companies.\n\n**Opportunities**\n\nSingapore’s economic achievement has its origin in trade. Long before its independence, Singapore has served as a port of call between the East and the West. This strategic link is more important now than ever before with the globalization of economies and increasing economic inter-depedence. Accelerated economic development in Asia will emphasize Singapore’s role as a gateway to the region.\n\nThe key to Singapore’s flourishing international trade has been its free trade policy. Virtually all goods enter Singapore duty-free. Singapore’s political stability, excellent business infrastructure, strategic location, sound legal framework, work class financial services and a pro-business approach have attracted many internation companies to do business with Singapore and to use Singapore as a base for their regional expansion.\n\nSingapore’s Web site offers information on business and trade opportunities in Singapore. This includes company listings, calendar of trade events, fairs and conventions.\n\n**Statistics**\n\nComprehensive statistics on various aspects of Singapore are listed in the Singapore Web site. Demographic statistics and economic and social indicators are compiled by the Department of Statistics. The Singapore Trade Statistics is published monthly by the Singapore Trade Development Board. Imports and exports are listed by country of origin and by destination.

New technologies emerge, industries shift, and the skills employers seek are constantly changing. Whether you’re a mid-career professional looking to stay relevant, a young professional building your foundation, or an employer seeking to invest in your workforce, SSG is here to empower your future. This article provides a comprehensive guide to this nationwide initiative by the Singaporean government, highlighting the benefits, resources, and how you can utilise them to achieve your career goals.\n\nThe Progression of SkillsFuture Singapore\n-----------------------------------------\n\n### What is SkillsFuture Singapore?\n\nSSG is a national movement that promotes lifelong learning and job skills enhancement for all Singaporeans. It recognises the significance of workforce skills for Singapore’s continued economic success and global competitiveness. SSG offers a wide range of resources to help you adapt, grow, and thrive in the dynamic job market. In 2023 alone, [SkillsFuture empowered over 520,000 individuals](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/skillsfuture-participation-drops-in-2023-despite-increased-employer-engagement) to invest in their professional development. Notably, nearly 192,000 participants leveraged their SkillsFuture Credits, with a significant majority (95%) utilising them for industry-specific courses, demonstrating a strong focus on career-oriented upskilling and reskilling.\n\n### History of SkillsFuture Singapore\n\nLaunched in 2015, SSG has undergone significant development over the years. The government has introduced various policy changes and SSG initiatives to expand its reach and effectiveness. These include increased education funding, the introduction of SkillsFuture Credits, and enhanced subsidies for mid-career professionals.\n\nObjectives and Target Audience\n------------------------------\n\nSSG caters to a wide range of individuals, including: **Mid-career professionals** SSG understands the challenges faced by those in the middle of their careers. The programme offers resources and financial support to help you upskill and reskill in in-demand areas, keeping you competitive and opening doors to new career opportunities. **Young professionals and students** As you embark on your professional journey, SSG provides valuable guidance to explore career paths aligned with industry needs. You can gain foundational skills and industry exposure through SSG work-study programmes, giving you a head start in your chosen field. **Employers and HR professionals** Investing in your employees’ job skills is an investment in your company’s future. SSG offers a range of training grants and programmes to help you develop your workforce, fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation within your organisation. By upskilling your employees, you can empower them to take on greater responsibility, potentially leading to promotions and advancements within your company. This not only benefits the individual employee but also strengthens your talent pool and improves overall company performance.\n\nKey Components of SkillsFuture Singapore\n----------------------------------------\n\nSSG offers a diverse range of resources to support your learning journey:\n\n### SkillsFuture Credits\n\nEvery Singaporean aged 25 and above receives a [SkillsFuture Credit](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/initiatives/mid-career/credit) balance to use for approved courses. This financial support makes skills acquisition more accessible, allowing you to invest in your professional development without breaking the bank. Additionally, from May 2024, all Singaporeans aged 40 and above will enjoy a [SkillsFuture Credit](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/career-resources/career-resources/education-career-personal-development/SkillsFuture_Credit.html) top-up of S$4,000. This is to help offset those out-of-pocket course fees for selected courses aligned with the current industry and employment needs.\n\n### SkillsFuture Work-Study Programmes\n\nThese [Work-Study Programmes](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/initiatives/students/workstudy) combine theoretical classroom learning with on-the-job experience, providing a unique opportunity to gain valuable industry exposure while pursuing your studies. This blend of learning allows you to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, giving you a competitive edge when entering the workforce.\n\n### SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy\n\nTurning 40 doesn’t have to mean a career plateau. The [Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/initiatives/mid-career/enhancedsubsidy) provides additional financial support for Singaporeans aged 40 and above to undergo relevant skills training. This government subsidy eases the financial burden of upskilling or reskilling, empowering you to make a smooth transition into new and exciting career paths. It’s important to note that the level of subsidy you receive can vary depending on the type of company you are employed by: **SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises)** The government recognises the importance of supporting skills development within SMEs. For employees working in SMEs, the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy can cover up to 70% of the course fees for approved SSG programmes. **MNCs (Multinational Corporations)** While MNCs also benefit from the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy, the subsidy level is generally lower than for SMEs. For employees working in MNCs, the subsidy typically covers up to 50% of the course fees. This tiered subsidy structure encourages companies of all sizes to invest in their employees’ professional development. For SMEs, the higher subsidy can make a significant difference in their ability to offer upskilling and reskilling opportunities to their workforce.\n\nBenefits of SkillsFuture Singapore (For Each Group)\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nSSG offers a comprehensive range of benefits designed to empower individuals at all stages of their careers and organisations seeking to invest in their workforce. Here’s a breakdown of the key advantages categorised by your specific needs.\n\n### For Mid-Career Professionals\n\n**Upskilling and Reskilling** Stay relevant and competitive by acquiring new in-demand skills or enhancing existing ones. SSG courses can open doors to exciting new career opportunities or upskilling opportunities within your current field. **Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy** Ease the financial burden of upskilling or reskilling with additional government training initiatives and educational subsidies specifically for those aged 40 and above. This subsidy allows you to invest in your professional development without derailing your budget. **Industry-Aligned Training and Career Transition** Explore courses designed to bridge the gap between your current skillset and the requirements of your target industry. With the right professional training and support, SSG can empower you to successfully transition into a new and fulfilling career path. **Career Growth** Obtaining industry-recognised credentials through SSG programmes can make you a more valuable asset to your employer. This can lead to career progression opportunities, increased responsibility, and higher earning potential.

These credits offset course fees, allowing you to invest in your future without a significant financial outlay. **Industry-Aligned Training:** SSG programmes ensure the skills you acquire are in high demand by employers. This increases your employability and improves your chances of landing a fulfilling job after graduation or during your early career stages. **Job Placement and Employment Outcomes** Some SSG programmes even offer job placement support, providing valuable assistance as you embark on your job search. This can include resume writing workshops, interview skills training, and even connecting you with potential employers.\n\n### For Employers and HR Professionals\n\n**Upskilling and Reskilling** Invest in your workforce by providing them with opportunities to develop the skills and knowledge needed to excel in their roles and adapt to evolving industry demands.

An **MNC in Singapore** isn’t just a business entity—it’s a key player in driving the nation’s economic growth and fostering innovation.\n\nThese companies fuel job creation, support technological advancements, and contribute significantly to Singapore’s global competitiveness. With their extensive networks and resources, MNCs are transforming industries and shaping the future of the economy.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the pivotal role of MNCs in Singapore, their impact on the economy, and how they inspire groundbreaking innovation.\n\n**Overview of MNC in Singapore**\n--------------------------------\n\n### **What is MNC in Singapore?**\n\nA [multinational corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation) (MNC) in Singapore is a large company with operations spanning multiple countries, with a significant presence in the city-state. Typically headquartered in another nation, these corporations maintain regional or local offices in Singapore to manage their global activities.\n\nMNCs in Singapore operate across various industries, including technology, food, logistics, and fashion, contributing to the nation’s dynamic economy.\n\nThe size and influence of MNCs allow them to create numerous employment opportunities and drive economic growth in Singapore. These corporations thrive by leveraging their vast resources, innovation, and commitment to maintaining consistent standards across international markets, benefiting both the MNCs and the local economy.\n\n### **Impact of MNCs on Singapore’s economy**\n\nMNCs play a pivotal role in driving Singapore’s economic growth. Their operations create thousands of jobs across various sectors, strengthening the nation’s workforce. Additionally, they attract substantial foreign direct investments (FDIs), boosting capital flows and fostering economic stability.\n\nBy partnering with local small and medium enterprises (SMEs), an **MNC company in Singapore** stimulates business growth and innovation within the local economy.\n\nSingapore’s reputation as a global business hub owes much to MNCs, which leverage the city-state’s strategic location and infrastructure to access Southeast Asian markets. Their presence not only enhances Singapore’s global business standing but also fosters a culture of innovation, making the country a magnet for cutting-edge industries.\n\n### **Why MNCs choose Singapore**\n\nSingapore’s appeal as a top destination for **multinational companies** lies in a combination of strategic advantages. The ease of starting and running a business is supported by efficient government processes, ensuring a seamless experience for investors.\n\nComplementing this is a robust legal framework and low crime rates, providing businesses with the stability and security essential for sustained success.\n\nSituated in the heart of Southeast Asia, Singapore acts as a gateway to emerging markets. Its exceptional logistics infrastructure and extensive air connectivity make operations more efficient, while comprehensive trade agreements reduce barriers to international commerce.\n\nAdditionally, the city-state’s dedication to protecting intellectual property ensures that innovations are well safeguarded, fostering confidence among businesses.\n\nSingapore’s vibrant financial ecosystem further enhances its attractiveness. Companies benefit from easy access to funding and financial services at competitive rates, creating an environment conducive to growth. To entice MNCs, the government offers generous tax incentives and exemptions, encouraging the establishment of regional headquarters.\n\nWith its stable political climate, unwavering commitment to intellectual property rights, and world-class infrastructure, Singapore provides a solid foundation for businesses to thrive. Together, these factors position Singapore as the destination of choice for MNCs looking to expand their global presence.\n\n**List of multinational companies in Singapore**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSingapore, a global business hub, hosts numerous multinational corporations across diverse industries, drawn by its strategic location, robust infrastructure, and pro-business environment. Below is a **list of multinational companies in Singapore**, categorized by industry.\n\n### **1. Tech and innovation**\n\nSingapore’s focus on innovation and technology has attracted leading MNCs that drive advancements in this sector. Companies like **3M**, **IBM**, **Micron Semiconductor Asia**, **Panasonic Asia Pacific**, and **Schneider Electric** leverage Singapore’s strong research ecosystem and skilled talent pool.\n\nThese MNCs not only enhance the industry but also contribute to building Singapore’s reputation as a regional innovation hub.\n\n### **2. Advisory services**\n\nThe advisory sector thrives in Singapore, with global firms providing essential services to businesses navigating complex markets. Leading names such as **Ernst & Young**, **Accenture**, **KPMG**, **Deloitte**, and **PricewaterhouseCoopers** deliver expertise in consulting, auditing, and strategy.\n\nThese MNCs benefit from Singapore’s stable economy and its position as a gateway to Southeast Asia.\n\n### **3. Banking**\n\nSingapore’s banking industry is bolstered by a mix of local and international MNCs. **UOB**, **Citibank**, **MayBank**, **OCBC Bank**, and **Standard Chartered Bank** serve as pillars of the financial ecosystem. These banks are drawn to Singapore for its regulatory efficiency, financial stability, and role as a global wealth management hub.\n\n### **4. Energy & industrial**\n\nIn the energy and industrial sectors, major players like **ExxonMobil**, **Shell**, **General Electric**, **Siemens**, **Caterpillar**, and **Sembcorp** are integral to Singapore’s industrial growth. These companies are attracted by Singapore’s advanced logistics capabilities and its position as a regional energy hub.\n\n### **5. Consumer goods and retail**\n\nMNC companies in Singapore like Procter & Gamble, Fraser & Neave, McDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Dairy Farm International dominate Singapore’s consumer goods and retail sector. Their presence is supported by Singapore’s vibrant consumer market and efficient supply chain infrastructure.\n\n### **6. Healthcare & pharmaceuticals**\n\nSingapore is a key hub for healthcare and pharmaceutical MNCs, including GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, and Novartis. These firms capitalize on the country’s strong intellectual property protection and access to regional markets.\n\n### **7. Real estate & hospitality**\n\nThe real estate and hospitality sectors are powered by MNCs such as Far East Organization, MapleTree Group, CapitaLand, Marina Bay Sands, and InterContinental Hotels Group. Singapore’s reputation as a global tourism and business destination makes it an ideal base for these companies.\n\n**What to consider before establishing an MNC in Singapore**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Legal considerations**\n\nUnderstanding and adhering to Singapore’s legal requirements is crucial for businesses seeking to establish themselves in the region. All companies must register with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), adhering to several key requirements:\n\n*   At least one director must be a Singapore resident, such as a citizen or Employment Pass holder.\n*   Companies must appoint a local company secretary within six months of incorporation.\n*   A physical Singapore address is mandatory for the company’s registered office.\n\nAdditionally, while the minimum paid-up capital for most companies is just SGD 1, certain sectors require higher amounts. For instance, insurance intermediary firms must have a minimum paid-up capital of SGD 300,000.\n\nBy partnering with a corporate service provider, like BBCIncorp, MNCs can navigate these requirements seamlessly, laying a solid legal foundation for operations in Singapore and across Asia. These services ensure compliance, mitigate risks, and provide ongoing support, allowing businesses to focus on growth.\n\n### **Logistical and strategic planning**\n\nSetting up operations in Singapore demands careful logistical and strategic planning. From securing office spaces to hiring skilled talent, every step plays a critical role in establishing a strong business base.\n\nSingapore’s world-class transport infrastructure, including Changi Airport and extensive shipping facilities, offers unparalleled connectivity, making it a natural gateway to Asia’s emerging markets.\n\nFor businesses expanding globally, outsourcing logistics can be a prudent choice. Third-party providers handle intricate supply chain processes, including documentation and compliance, ensuring efficient and timely delivery of goods.\n\nAdditionally, developing a localized strategy through research and partnerships helps companies adapt to market nuances, further enhancing their growth trajectory.\n\n### **Challenges to anticipate**\n\nWhile Singapore offers a conducive environment for MNCs, businesses should prepare for potential hurdles. High operational costs, intense market competition, and global uncertainties can pose challenges.\n\nCompanies must adopt strategic approaches, such as leveraging government incentives, fostering innovation, and maintaining operational efficiency, to mitigate these issues.\n\nProactive planning, including robust cost management and market research, helps businesses stay competitive. Moreover, building resilience through flexible strategies and continuous adaptation to external changes ensures long-term sustainability in a dynamic global market.\n\nSingapore’s supportive business ecosystem, strategic location, and infrastructure provide immense opportunities for MNCs, but success hinges on meticulous preparation and adaptability.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of **MNC in Singapore** has been pivotal in driving economic growth and fostering innovation. With its strategic location, robust infrastructure, and pro-business environment, Singapore continues to attract leading global corporations across diverse industries.\n\nFor businesses looking to tap into this thriving ecosystem, ensuring a strong legal foundation and seamless incorporation process is essential.

Within a very short period of time, largely because of the use of English common law and other regulatory advantages over the surrounding area, Singapore became a powerful economic engine. In fact, right now Singapore is one of the top six cities in the world....These cities are governed by regulatory systems that deliver open trade, property rights protection, the rule of law and merit-based competition that creates an environment where insurgent companies can actually be successful. There is nothing in the way of an entrepreneur’s vision and dreams. \"\n> \n> \n> Shanker Singham\n\n![Image 2: A view of the city skyline at night.](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Singapore_Skyline_Wikimedia_2560x519.webp)\n\nThe case of Singapore’s Economic Miracle highlights the impact of building a nation on the basis of the Three Pillars.\n\nSingapore today has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, currently outdoing the US, and well beyond the UK. And the rate at which they developed their powerhouse economy is outstanding.\n\n![Image 3: A line graph showing the gdp per capita for different countries.](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/smush-webp/2024/04/GDPPerCapitaSingUSUK_569x372.png.webp)\n\n![Image 4: Singapore annual gdp at current parket prices](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/smush-webp/2024/04/GDPedited_491x306.jpg.webp)\n\nStarting with their 1965 separation from the Malaysian Federation, Singapore faced on their own, the daunting task of replacing their role as the transshipment point and major naval base for the British Empire in Southeast Asia. They chose to establish themselves as an independent economic force, and in an entirely new national direction.\n\n**S**ingapore’s Stages of Economic Development\n\nBetween the 1960’s and the 2000’s, Singapore went through the following phases: Labor intensive, skill intensive, capital intensive, technology intensive, and, finally, innovation intensive. (See the IMF study Breaking the Oil Spell: The Gulf Falcons’ Path to Diversification, [Chapter 3](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/display/book/9781513537863/ch004.xml), entitled “Going Beyond Comparative Advantage: How Singapore Did It” by Phillip Yeo.)\n\nIncome per capita went from $428 per year to $54,000 per year (US dollars). In 2022, Singapore’s per capita income was $83,000.\n\n![Image 5: A line graph showing the growth of capital and technology.](https://competerefoundation.org/wp-content/smush-webp/2023/10/fivephasessingaporedepartmentofstatistics.jpg.webp)\n\nBy the 1970’s, manufacturing had become a significant percentage of Singapore’s GDP, which was an initial crucial step away from their previous existence as a British outpost.\n\nThe Singapore government’s role in this development was, of course, significant in these early stages.\n\nThe land was developed to establish areas suitable for industry and manufacturing, and this included the improvement of internal waterways.\n\nHousing and health care were provided for the population. Singapore’s government also played a major role in the education system, which was crucial for the nation to move forward towards greater skill sets and innovation.\n\nLooking to the outside world, Singapore’s leaders realized they needed to attract foreign investment, which they accomplished with great success.\n\nElectronics and computer parts, including software and chips, were amongst some of the types of companies which established facilities in Singapore. In 1969, Texas Instruments opened a plant in Singapore, beginning a flood of foreign investment.\n\nSingapore, with the collaboration of foreign nations and multi-national corporations, established training centers in order to upgrade the skill level of its citizens. But, as is typical in Singapore’s free market thinking, the nation also adopted a liberal policy towards immigration of highly skilled foreign nationals in order to fill the gap of needed expertise.\n\nContrary to various prejudices against “cheap foreign labor”, in the 1980’s Singapore embarked upon its “Second Industrial Revolution” – the push towards capital-intensive industries.\n\nBy the 90’s, Singapore set its sights on becoming a “first world” nation in every respect. This included a shift towards knowledge and innovation. This was fully accomplished in the 2000’s.\n\nToday, Singapore is a fully diversified and forward-driven nation. (See chart summarizing GNP by sector.) Watch the video below for a quick summary of Singapore’s resiliency, including how they survived the economic blow of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nToday, Singapore is a fully diversified and forward-driven nation. (See chart summarizing GNP by sector.) Watch the video below for a quick summary of Singapore’s resiliency, including how they survived the economic blow of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThroughout this period, Singapore did not impose restrictions on foreign companies’ investments into their nation, imposed virtually no tariffs, and very little regulation preventing foreign entities from setting up shop in their city-state. Their pro-competitive and common law based regulatory environment also enabled foreign investors to be successful.\n\nIn the first stage, Singapore focused upon more labor-intensive industry.

But as Dr. Henry Kissinger states in his preface to Lee Kuan Yew’s From Third World to First, “… The long-established nations of the West have fallen prey to the temptation of ignoring history and judging each state by the criteria of their own civilizations.”\n\nWe of the Competere Foundation, point to Singapore, and other cases, such as Dubai, to prove how adherence to the principles of The Three Pillars provides a model for success.\n\n(Watch the video below for a wonderful overview of Singapore’s historic transformation.)\n\nSingapore and the three pillars\n-------------------------------\n\nCompetition within the Border\n-----------------------------\n\n*   The government of Singapore has been increasing its commitment to an innovation-based economy, which is focused on growing its domestic start- ups based largely upon new technology.\n*   Singapore provides an excellent environment for establishing such domestic enterprise by its investment in the quality of education and workforce development. Venture funds have been aided by the government, providing support for new ventures and scaling them upwards.\n*   Singapore’s extraordinary infrastructure includes cutting edge development around green technology, smart-city technology, and water management.

In general, it is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of resources.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-4) A given economy is a set of processes that involves its [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture \"Culture\"), [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Values \"Values\"), education, technological evolution, history, [social organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_organization \"Social organization\"), [political structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_structure \"Political structure\"), [legal systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_systems \"Legal systems\"), and [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource \"Natural resource\") as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand alone.\n\nEconomic agents can be individuals, [businesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business \"Business\"), [organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization \"Organization\"), or [governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government \"Government\"). Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency \"Currency\"). However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain.\n\nEconomic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital. It has changed over time due to [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology \"Technology\"), [innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation \"Innovation\") (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) and changes in [industrial relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_relations \"Industrial relations\") (most notably [child labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour \"Child labour\") being replaced in some parts of the world with [universal access to education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_access_to_education \"Universal access to education\")).\n\nEtymology\n---------\n\n[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Luchtfoto_van_Lower_Manhattan.jpg/250px-Luchtfoto_van_Lower_Manhattan.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Luchtfoto_van_Lower_Manhattan.jpg)\n\n[New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), the world's principal [fintech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech \"Fintech\") and [financial center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_center \"Financial center\")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-NewYorkFintechAndFinancialCapitalWorld-5)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-6) and the epicenter of the [world's principal metropolitan economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_GDP \"List of cities by GDP\")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-NYCEpicenterUSMetroEconomy-7)\n\nThe word _economy_ in English is derived from the [Middle French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_French \"Middle French\")'s _yconomie_, which itself derived from the [Medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin \"Medieval Latin\")'s _[oeconomia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oeconomia \"wikt:oeconomia\")_. The Latin word has its origin at the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek \"Ancient Greek\")'s _oikonomia_ or _oikonomos_. The word's first part _oikos_ means \"house\", and the second part _nemein_ means \"to manage\".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-:0-8)\n\nThe most frequently used current sense, denoting \"the economic system of a country or an area\", seems not to have developed until the 1650s.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-9)\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Earliest roots\n\n[![Image 4: see caption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/BosraMosaicCamels.png/250px-BosraMosaicCamels.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BosraMosaicCamels.png)\n\nAncient Roman mosaic from [Bosra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosra \"Bosra\"), depicting a merchant leading camels through the desert\n\nAs long as someone has been making, supplying and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex. [Sumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer \"Sumer\") developed a large-scale economy based on [commodity money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money \"Commodity money\"), while the [Babylonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonians \"Babylonians\") and their neighboring [city states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_states \"City states\") later developed the earliest system of [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics \"Economics\") as we think of, in terms of rules/laws on [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt \"Debt\"), legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices, and private property.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-Sheila-10)\n\nThe Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-yale2-11)\n\nThe ancient economy was based primarily on [subsistence farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_farming \"Subsistence farming\").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-12) The [Shekel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekel \"Shekel\") are the first to refer to a unit of weight and currency, used by the [Semitic peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_peoples \"Semitic peoples\"). The first usage of the term came from [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia \"Mesopotamia\") circa 3000 BC. and referred to a specific mass of [barley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley \"Barley\") which related other values in a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) \"Metric (mathematics)\") such as silver, bronze, copper, etc. A barley/shekel was originally both a unit of [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency \"Currency\") and a unit of weight, just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one-pound mass of silver.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-brony-13)\n\nMost exchange of goods had occurred through social relationships. There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. In [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece \"Ancient Greece\"), where the present English word 'economy' originated,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-:0-8) many people were [bond slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_slaves \"Bond slaves\") of the [freeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeholder_(government) \"Freeholder (government)\").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-14) The economic discussion was driven by [scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity \"Scarcity\").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn Chinese economic law, the huge cycle of [institutional innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution \"Institution\") contains an idea. Serving a non-market economy promotes a firm's tenure that is legally guaranteed and protected from bureaucratic opportunities.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-15)\n\n### Middle Ages\n\nIn the Middle Ages, what is now known as an economy was not far from the subsistence level. Most exchange occurred within [social groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_groups \"Social groups\"). On top of this, the great conquerors raised what we now call [venture capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital \"Venture capital\") (from _ventura_, ital.; _risk_) to finance their captures. The [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics) \"Capital (economics)\") should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the [New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World \"New World\"). The discoveries of [Marco Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo \"Marco Polo\") (1254–1324), [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus \"Christopher Columbus\") (1451–1506) and [Vasco da Gama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama \"Vasco da Gama\") (1469–1524) led to a first [global](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization \"Globalization\") economy. The first [enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company \"Company\") were trading establishments. In 1513, the first [stock exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange \"Stock exchange\") was founded in [Antwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp \"Antwerp\"). Economy at the time meant primarily [trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade \"Trade\").\n\nThe European captures became branches of the [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe \"Europe\") states, the so-called [colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonies \"Colonies\"). The rising [nation-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-state \"Nation-state\")[Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain \"Spain\"), [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal \"Portugal\"), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France \"France\"), [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\") and the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands \"Netherlands\") tried to control the trade through [custom duties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_duties \"Custom duties\") and [mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism \"Mercantilism\") (from _mercator_, lat.: [merchant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant \"Merchant\")) was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and [public interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest \"Public interest\"). The [secularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularization \"Secularization\") in Europe allowed states to use the immense property of the church for the development of towns. The influence of the [nobles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobles \"Nobles\") decreased. The first [Secretaries of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretaries_of_State \"Secretaries of State\") for economy started their work. [Bankers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankers \"Bankers\") like [Amschel Mayer Rothschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amschel_Mayer_Rothschild \"Amschel Mayer Rothschild\") (1773–1855) started to finance national projects such as wars and [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure \"Infrastructure\"). Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the [citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens \"Citizens\") of a state.\n\n### Industrial Revolution\n\nThe first [economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist \"Economist\") in the true modern meaning of the word was the Scotsman [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith \"Adam Smith\") (1723–1790) who was inspired partly by the ideas of [physiocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiocracy \"Physiocracy\"), a reaction to mercantilism and also later Economics student, Adam Mari.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-16) He defined the elements of a national economy: [products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business) \"Product (business)\") are offered at a [natural price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_price \"Natural price\") generated by the use of [competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition \"Competition\") - [supply and demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand \"Supply and demand\") - and the [division of labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labor \"Division of labor\"). He maintained that the basic motive for [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade \"Free trade\") is human self-interest. The so-called self-interest hypothesis became the [anthropological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropological \"Anthropological\") basis for economics. [Thomas Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Malthus \"Thomas Malthus\") (1766–1834) transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of [overpopulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation \"Human overpopulation\").\n\nThe [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution \"Industrial Revolution\") was a period from the 18th to the 19th century where major changes in [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture \"Agriculture\"), [manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing \"Manufacturing\"), [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining \"Mining\"), and [transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport \"Transport\") had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"), then subsequently spreading throughout [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe \"Europe\"), [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America \"North America\"), and eventually the world.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-17) The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some way. In Europe wild [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism \"Capitalism\") started to replace the system of [mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism \"Mercantilism\") (today: [protectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism \"Protectionism\")) and led to [economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth \"Economic growth\"). The period is called the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution \"Industrial Revolution\") because the system of [production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(economics) \"Production (economics)\") and [division of labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labor \"Division of labor\") enabled the [mass production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production \"Mass production\") of [goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_(economics) \"Good (economics)\").\n\n### 20th century\n\nThe contemporary concept of \"the economy\" wasn't popularly known until the American [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\") in the 1930s.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-invention-18)\n\nAfter the chaos of two [World Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War \"World War\") and the devastating Great Depression, policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] This was explored and discussed by [Friedrich August von Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_August_von_Hayek \"Friedrich August von Hayek\") (1899–1992) and [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman \"Milton Friedman\") (1912–2006) who pleaded for a global [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade \"Free trade\") and are supposed to be the fathers of the so-called [neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism \"Neoliberalism\").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-Boas20092-19)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-20) However, the prevailing view was that held by [John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes \"John Maynard Keynes\") (1883–1946), who argued for a stronger control of the [markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics) \"Market (economics)\") by the state. The theory that the state can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called [Keynesianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesianism \"Keynesianism\") in his honor.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-21) In the late 1950s, the economic growth in America and Europe—often called _[Wirtschaftswunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder \"Wirtschaftswunder\")_ (German for _economic miracle_) —brought up a new form of economy: [mass consumption economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_consumption_economy \"Mass consumption economy\"). In 1958, [John Kenneth Galbraith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith \"John Kenneth Galbraith\") (1908–2006) was the first to speak of an [affluent society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluent_society \"Affluent society\") in his book _[The Affluent Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Affluent\\_Society \"The Affluent Society\")_.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-22) In most of the countries the economic system is called a [social market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy \"Social market economy\").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-23)\n\n### 21st century\n\n[![Image 5: see caption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange_%28Ank_Kumar%29_02.jpg/250px-Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange_%28Ank_Kumar%29_02.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange_(Ank_Kumar)_02.jpg)\n\n[Frankfurt Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange \"Frankfurt Stock Exchange\") in 2015\n\nWith [the fall of the Iron Curtain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 \"Revolutions of 1989\") and the transition of the countries of the Eastern Bloc towards democratic government and market economies, the idea of the [post-industrial society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-industrial_society \"Post-industrial society\") is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the [service sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_sector \"Service sector\") receives instead of industrialization. Some attribute the first use of this term to Daniel Bell's 1973 book, _The Coming of Post-Industrial Society_, while others attribute it to social philosopher Ivan Illich's book, _[Tools for Conviviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools\\_for\\_Conviviality \"Tools for Conviviality\")_. The term is also applied in philosophy to designate the fading of [postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism \"Postmodernism\") in the late 90s and especially in the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nWith the spread of [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet \"Internet\") as a mass media and communication medium especially after 2000–2001, the idea for the Internet and [information economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_economy \"Information economy\") is given place because of the growing importance of [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce \"E-commerce\") and electronic businesses, also the term for a global information society as understanding of a new type of \"all-connected\" society is created. In the late 2000s, the new type of economies and economic expansions of countries like [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Century \"Chinese Century\"), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_as_an_emerging_superpower \"Brazil as an emerging superpower\"), and [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_as_a_potential_superpower \"India as a potential superpower\") bring attention and interest to economies different from the usually dominating Western-type economies and economic models.\n\nElements\n--------\n\n### Types\n\nA [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy \"Market economy\") is one where [goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_(economics) \"Good (economics)\") and [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics) \"Service (economics)\") are produced and exchanged according to [demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand \"Demand\") and [supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_(economics) \"Supply (economics)\") between participants (economic agents) by [barter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter \"Barter\") or a [medium of exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange \"Medium of exchange\") with a [credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_(finance) \"Credit (finance)\") or [debit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit \"Debit\")[value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics) \"Value (economics)\") accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-24) A [planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy \"Planned economy\") is one where political agents directly control what is produced and how it is sold and distributed.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-25) A [green economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_economy \"Green economy\") is [low-carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon \"Low-carbon\") and resource efficient. In a green economy, growth in income and employment is driven by public and private investments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_efficiency_(physics) \"Energy efficiency (physics)\") and [resource efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_efficiency \"Resource efficiency\"), and prevent the [loss of biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss \"Biodiversity loss\") and [ecosystem services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_services \"Ecosystem services\").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-26) A [gig economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_economy \"Gig economy\") is one in which short-term jobs are assigned or chosen on-demand.

The economic growth took place mostly in mining, construction and manufacturing industries. [Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce \"Commerce\") became more significant due to the need for improved exchange and distribution of produce throughout the community.\n*   In the economies of modern [consumer societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_society \"Consumer society\") phase there is a growing part played by [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics) \"Service (economics)\"), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance \"Finance\"), and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology \"Technology\")—the [knowledge economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy \"Knowledge economy\").\n\nIn modern economies, these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed by the [three-sector model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model \"Three-sector model\"):[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-28)\n\n*   [Primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector_of_the_economy \"Primary sector of the economy\"): Involves the extraction and production of [raw materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_materials \"Raw materials\"), such as [corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain \"Grain\"), [coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal \"Coal\"), [wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood \"Wood\") and [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron \"Iron\").\n*   [Secondary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy \"Secondary sector of the economy\"): Involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into [cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars \"Cars\"), or [textiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textiles \"Textiles\") into clothing.\n*   [Tertiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy \"Tertiary sector of the economy\"): Involves the provision of [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics) \"Service (economics)\") to consumers and businesses, such as [baby-sitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby-sitting \"Baby-sitting\"), [cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film \"Film\") and [banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking \"Banking\").\n\nOther sectors of the developed community include:\n\n*   the [public sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector \"Public sector\") or state sector (which usually includes: parliament, law-courts and government centers, various emergency services, public health, shelters for impoverished and threatened people, transport facilities, air/sea ports, post-natal care, hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, preserved historical buildings, parks/gardens, nature-reserves, some universities, national sports grounds/stadiums, national arts/concert-halls or theaters and centers for various religions).\n*   the [private sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector \"Private sector\") or privately run businesses.\n*   the [voluntary sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_sector \"Voluntary sector\") or social sector.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-29)\n\n### Indicators\n\nThe [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product \"Gross domestic product\") (GDP) of a country is a measure of the size of its economy, or more specifically, monetary measure of the market value of all the [final goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good \"Final good\") and services produced.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-30) The most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the GDP and [GDP per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_per_capita \"GDP per capita\"). While often useful, GDP only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nDue to the growing importance of the financial sector in modern times,[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-31) the term _real economy_ is used by analysts[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-32)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-33) as well as politicians[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-34) to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with the actual production of goods and services,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-35) as ostensibly contrasted with the _paper economy_, or the financial side of the economy,[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-36) which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets. Alternate and long-standing terminology distinguishes measures of an economy expressed in [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics) \"Real versus nominal value (economics)\") values (adjusted for [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation \"Inflation\")), such as [real GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_GDP \"Real GDP\"), or in [nominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics) \"Real versus nominal value (economics)\") values (unadjusted for inflation).[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-37)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-38)\n\nStudies\n-------\n\nThe study of economics are roughly divided into [macroeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics \"Macroeconomics\") and [microeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics \"Microeconomics\").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-39) Today, the range of fields of study examining the economy revolves around the [social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science \"Social science\") of economics,[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-40)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-41) but may also include [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sociology \"Economic sociology\"),[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-press.princeton.edu-42)[history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history \"Economic history\"),[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-43)[anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_anthropology \"Economic anthropology\"),[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-44) and [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_geography \"Economic geography\").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-45) Practical fields directly related to the human activities involving [production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(economics) \"Production (economics)\"), [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(economics) \"Distribution (economics)\"), [exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade \"Trade\"), and [consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_(economics) \"Consumption (economics)\") of [goods and services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services \"Goods and services\") as a whole are [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_economics \"Business economics\"),[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-46)[engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_economics \"Engineering economics\"),[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-Dharmaraj2010-47)[government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy \"Economic policy\"),[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-48) and [health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_economics \"Health economics\").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-49) Macroeconomics is studied at the regional and national levels, and common analyses include income and production, money, prices, employment, international trade, and other issues.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_note-50)\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n*   [Economic democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_democracy \"Economic democracy\")\n*   [Economic history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history \"Economic history\")\n*   [Economic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system \"Economic system\")\n*   [Social economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_economy \"Social economy\")\n*   [Solidarity economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_economy \"Solidarity economy\")\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy#cite_ref-3)**Sometimes spelled **oeconomy** or, with a ligature, **œconomy** in [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English \"British English\"), both are pronounced .

This transformation took place in the second half of the 20th century under the leadership of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his government.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-39) One of the key factors contributing to Singapore's economic miracle was its strategic location, which made it an ideal hub for international trade and commerce.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-40)\n\nThe country's main exports include [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics \"Electronics\"), [chemicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical \"Chemical\") and [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics) \"Service (economics)\").

He left Calcutta and set out to explore much of South-East Asia. At the time, the Dutch Empire and British Empire were close economic rivals. Colonization enabled these empires to gain control of the vast resources of militarily weaker and economically less prosperous [nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nations \"Nations\"). Raffles was looking for a new settlement that could replace Malacca as a key economic advantage over the Dutch Empire. The former had been handed over to the Dutch under the [Treaty of Vienna of 1815](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Vienna_(1815) \"Treaty of Vienna (1815)\").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-58) Raffles found Singapore to be a perfect location, sitting just of the edge of the Straits of Malacca, nowadays one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. As well, the territory had key economic resources which would benefit the British. There was abundant timber and fresh water, and a natural deep water harbor which would be beneficial for the British fleet. He arrived on an island at the mouth of the Singapore River, where there was a small Malay settlement. At the time accompanied by William Farquhar, Raffles met with [Temenggong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temenggong \"Temenggong\") (essentially, Chief of Security, for the settlement) [Abdul Rahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temenggong_Abdul_Rahman \"Temenggong Abdul Rahman\") to negotiate the right to establish a trading post on the island, under the British Empire. The island was ruled nominally from [Johar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor_Sultanate \"Johor Sultanate\") on the peninsula by [Tengku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengku \"Tengku\") (essentially, Prince) [Rahman, Sultan of Johor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rahman_Muazzam_Shah_of_Johor \"Abdul Rahman Muazzam Shah of Johor\"), who was heavily influenced by the Dutch and the [Bugis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugis \"Bugis\"). However, the Sultanate was weakened by factional division so that Temenggong Abdul Rahman and his officials were more loyal to Rahman's elder brother Tengku [Hussein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor \"Hussein Shah of Johor\") (or Tengku Long) who was living in exile in “Riau” (likely [the Riau Archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riau_Archipelago \"Riau Archipelago\")). With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Hussein back to Singapore.

This allowed for a decrease in travel time, which resulted in a rise in trade volume.

With spurs of race riots the colonial powers sought to empower and establish a formidable local government. With most of the unrest resulting from high unemployment, the local government was directed to solve this issue.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-Lim_2015-57) The [Economic Development Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Development_Board \"Economic Development Board\") was formed to empower the Singapore government in establishing, developing, and financing industrial undertakings.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-62)\n\nIn 1955, a Singapore local legislative Assembly with 25 out of 35 members elected was formed.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-63)\n\nUpon independence from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore faced a small domestic market, and high levels of unemployment and poverty. 70 percent of Singapore's households lived in badly overcrowded conditions, and a third of its people squatted in slums on the city fringes. Unemployment averaged 14 percent, GDP per capita was US$516, and half of the population was illiterate[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_].\n\n### Industrialisation boom and change\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Industrialisation boom and change\")]\n\nAfter [Lee Kuan Yew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew \"Lee Kuan Yew\") was elected, he oversaw significant economic reforms to the country. Structural change and machinery propelled the economy during his tenure. Singapore was a small and densely populated nation, with very few natural resources and little space to grow outwards. Recognizing this, Lee identified that the key advantage that Singapore held was its human capital, and its ability to provide highly educated citizens capable of competing in global industry and trade. On 1 August 1961, the Singapore Government established the [Economic Development Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Development_Board \"Economic Development Board\") to spearhead an investment drive, and make Singapore an attractive destination for foreign investment.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-Huff_1995-64) FDI inflows increased greatly over the following decades, and by 2001 foreign companies accounted for 75% of manufactured output and 85% of manufactured exports. Meanwhile, Singapore's savings and investment rates rose among the highest levels in the world, while household consumption and wage shares of GDP fell among the lowest.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-65)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-66)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-67) The beginning of Lee's tenure was marked with success and from 1965–1973, annual growth of real GDP was 12.7%. He directed spending to repair and improve infrastructure. This effort spurred economic productivity and put in place the foundations needed to build up basic industry. As of 2019, Singapore's infrastructure is ranked the best in terms of quality, with a score of 95.4 out of 100.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-68) The period from 1973-1979 marked a struggle for Singapore as they pivoted away from basic infrastructure spending and moved towards more sustainable economic progress. The 1973 oil crisis raised government awareness of issues such as economic concentration. It forced the government to hold new forum to discuss ways of adapting the countries economy to economic change. GDP growth during this time was slightly lower than the preceding years, at 8.5% annually. However, unemployment was virtually 0%, and most of the population had experienced great strides in productivity.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-69) The government highlighted a focus in technology and education to be the new wave of economic gain.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-70) In addition, they identified financial services as a key area in which Singapore could diversify and attract new growth. During this time, the government invested heavily in its budding financial services industry. It managed to minimize inflation and provide workers with the proper equipment and machinery to sustain growth.\n\n#### Growth in the service sector\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Growth in the service sector\")]\n\nAs a result of this investment drive, Singapore's capital stock increased 33 times by 1992, and achieved a tenfold increase in the capital-labour ratio.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-71) Living standards steadily rose, with more families moving from a lower-income status to middle-income security with increased household incomes.\n\nIn 1987, Lee claimed that (based on the government's home ownership criterion) 80% of Singaporeans could now be considered to be members of the middle-class. Under Lee, Singapore had both low inflation and unemployment. However, much unlike the economic policies of Greece and the rest of Europe, Singapore followed a policy of individualising the social safety net. This led to a higher than average savings rate and a very sustainable economy in the long run. Without a burdensome welfare state or its likeliness, Singapore has developed a very self-reliant and skilled workforce well versed for a global economy.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-72)\n\nIn the late 1980s, Singapore's export-driven economic model required adjustment for further development.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-:8-73): 79  The 1990s emergence of efficient manufacturing firms in southeast Asia challenged the nation with such a small labor force and land restrictions. Friedrich noted how \" it would be \"unlikely to expand beyond the current 25% share of the economy,\" when regarding manufacturing firms.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-74) Despite struggling in the manufacturing sector Singapore thrived in global finance, trading, and was an industrial hub for international trade.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-75) It positioned itself as a supplier of secondary factors, including expertise in management and industrial infrastructure, and emphasized a regionalization strategy through which it would invest in other Asian countries.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-:8-73): 79  Singaporean investment in China was a particularly important element of this strategy.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-:8-73): 79–80  To advance its regionalization strategy, Singapore began its Regional Industrial Parks Program to boost Singapore's domestic economy through profits from foreign industrial parks modeled on Singapore's [Jurong Industrial Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurong_Industrial_Estate \"Jurong Industrial Estate\") and also to build diplomatic ties in the host countries.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-:8-73): 80\n\nSingapore's economic strategy produced real growth averaging 8.0% from 1960 to 1999. Since the nation's independence in 1965, Singapore's GDP has amassed an average of a 9.5% increase.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-Chen_Shao_2017-76) The economy picked up in 1999 under [Goh Chok Tong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong \"Goh Chok Tong\"), the Prime Minister of Singapore, after the regional financial crisis, with a growth rate of 5.4%, followed by 9.9% for 2000. However, the economic slowdown in the United States, Japan and the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\"), as well as the worldwide electronics slump, had reduced the estimated economic growth in 2001 to a negative 2.0%.\n\nThe economy expanded by 2.2% the following year, and by 1.1% in 2003 when Singapore was affected by the [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS \"SARS\") outbreak. Subsequently, a major turnaround occurred in 2004 allowed it to make a significant recovery of 8.3% growth in Singapore, although the actual growth fell short of the target growth for the year more than half with only 2.5%. In 2005, economic growth was 6.4%; and in 2006, 7.9%.\n\nIt was apparent that Singapore would also struggle due to the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis \"2008 financial crisis\") given its status as a financial services hub. Some market commentators doubted the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the crisis. In the end the economy grew in 2009 by 3.1% and in 2010, the nation saw a 15.2% growth rate.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-Chen_Shao_2017-76)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-77)\n\nAs of 8 June 2013, Singapore's unemployment rate is around 1.9% and the country's economy has a lowered growth rate, with a rate of 1.8% on a quarter-by-quarter basis—compared to 14.8% in 2010.\n\n2015 and 2016 saw a downturn for the nation as GDP growth shrunk to just 2 percent. Despite growth diminishing, the nation has yet to post negative growth rates which are a positive sign. During the same period of diminishing economic growth.

As of November 2011, the top six Singapore-listed GLCs accounted for about 17 percent of total capitalization of the Singapore Exchange (SGX). These fully and partially state-owned enterprises operate on a commercial basis and are granted no competitive advantage over privately owned enterprises.

The government has also attempted some measures including [wage restraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomes_policy \"Incomes policy\") measures and release of unused buildings in an effort to control rising commercial rents with the view to lowering the cost of doing business in Singapore when central business district office rents tripled in 2006.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nSingapore is considered a global financial hub by many leading financial analysts, economists and politicians, with Singapore banks offering world-class corporate bank account facilities.

workforce\n-------------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Singapore workforce\")]\n\nIn 2000, Singapore had a workforce of about 2.2 million. With limited access to natural resources, Singapore had been forced to invest in its people.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The country has the largest proficiency of English language speakers in Asia, making it an attractive place for multinational corporations. Singapore has come a long way from where it once stood. In the 1970s according to Tilak Abeysinghe \"2.4 percent of the labor force were degree holders\". By 1990 the number rose to just 6.3%. In 2013 the percentage of the labor force who held degrees reached 31%. The nation's directive toward high skilled labor jobs, has promoted both growth and education to the region.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-123) The [National Trades Union Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress \"National Trades Union Congress\") (NTUC), the sole trade union federation, which has a symbiotic relationship with the ruling party, accounts for almost 99% of total organised labour. Government policy and pro-activity rather than labour legislation controls general labour and trade union matters.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe Employment Act offers little protection to white-collar workers due to an income threshold. The Industrial Arbitration Court handles labour-management disputes that cannot be resolved informally through the Ministry of Manpower. The [Singapore Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Government \"Singapore Government\") has stressed the importance of co-operation between unions, management and government ([tripartism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartism \"Tripartism\")), as well as the early resolution of disputes. There has been only one strike in the past 15 years.\n\nSingapore has enjoyed virtually full employment for long periods of time. Amid an economic slump, the unemployment rate rose to 4.0% by the end of 2001, from 2.4% early in the year. Unemployment has since declined and as of 2012 the unemployment rate stands at 1.9%.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-124)\n\nWhile the Singapore government has taken a stance against [minimum wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage \"Minimum wage\") and [unemployment benefit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefit \"Unemployment benefit\") schemes, in 2007 the government introduced a Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme to supplement wages of low-skilled workers.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-Workfare-125) To support employers in hiring older Singaporean workers, Special Employment Credit (SEC) was introduced in 2011. It was first enhanced in 2012 to provide employers with support in hiring older Singaporean workers and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). It helped the employers to cope with costs associated with the increase in Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates for older workers. The 5-year SEC scheme was further extended an additional 3 years, up to 2019 to encourage employers to voluntarily re-employ older workers aged 65 and above.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-126) The Singapore Government and the NTUC have tried a range of programs to increase lagging productivity and boost the labour force participation rates of women and older workers. However, labour shortages persist in the service sector and in many low-skilled positions in the construction and electronics industries. Foreign workers help make up this shortfall. In 2000, there were about 600,000 foreign workers in Singapore, constituting 27% of the total work force. As a result, wages are relatively suppressed or do not rise for all workers. To have some controls, the government imposes a foreign worker levy payable by employers for low end workers like domestic help and construction workers.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-127) In 2012, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) reported that Singapore should continue to fine-tune the calibration of its inflow of foreigners as the country continues to face an ageing population and a shrinking workforce. Singapore Parliament accepted the recommendations by its Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) for the optimal ratio of the level of immigration and foreign manpower for both high and low skilled workers.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-128) The Government recognises that the current overall foreign workforce should complement the local resident workforce and not replace the Singaporean Core concept, and helps companies greatly as they raise productivity through business restructuring and workforce retraining; raise resident labour force participation rate.[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-129)[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-130)\n\nPoverty and economic inequality\n-------------------------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Poverty and economic inequality\")]\n\nSingapore is one of the world's wealthiest countries _per capita_, but its [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient \"Gini coefficient\") is high in comparison to developed countries. Statistics on income inequality are published by the Singapore Department of Statistics.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-131) Without taking taxes and social transfers into account, Singapore's [gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient \"Gini coefficient\") puts the country in the medium range. Nevertheless, the country remains on the \"very high\" category on the inequality-adjusted human development index (IHDI), a ranking similar to the [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index \"Human Development Index\") (HDI), but with [inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality \"Economic inequality\") also accounted for.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-IHDI-132)\n\nIn October 2018, [Oxfam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam \"Oxfam\") ranked Singapore 149 out of 157 in its Commitment to Reducing Inequality Index 2018, placing it among the bottom ten of the countries in the index, which ranks countries based on efforts to reduce [economic inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality \"Economic inequality\").[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-oxfam_inequality-133) In its report, Oxfam accused Singapore of practices which encouraged \"harmful tax practices\", not having a universal [minimum wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage \"Minimum wage\") (apart from [janitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janitor \"Janitor\") and security guards), and poor performance on [labour rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_rights \"Labour rights\").[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-134) The government responded to the report by claiming that it was more important to look at \"real outcomes\" such as Singapore's high home ownership, health, education, and employment, rather than public spending or tax rates, also saying that the report \"assumes that high taxation and high public expenditure reflects commitment to combating inequality\".[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-oxfam_inequality-133)\n\nThe government provides social support through a variety of social assistance schemes. The [Ministry of Social and Family Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Social_and_Family_Development \"Ministry of Social and Family Development\") runs ComCare, a program which provides income support for low-income citizen households through various schemes for short-to-medium term assistance, long-term assistance, child support, and urgent financial needs.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-135) The [Community Development Councils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Development_Council \"Community Development Council\") also run various local assistance schemes within their districts.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-136) The [Ministry of Manpower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Manpower_(Singapore) \"Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)\") runs a Silver Support Scheme which provides additional financial support for low-income elderly with no family support.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-137) Meanwhile, the [Ministry of Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Singapore) \"Ministry of Health (Singapore)\") also runs MediFund to assist families that have difficulty paying for medical bills despite government subsidies and [other health financing schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Singapore \"Healthcare in Singapore\").[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-138) In addition, the [National Council of Social Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Social_Service \"National Council of Social Service\") coordinates a range of 450 non-government [voluntary welfare organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_welfare_organisation \"Voluntary welfare organisation\") to provide social services, while raising funds through [The Community Chest of Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Community_Chest_of_Singapore \"The Community Chest of Singapore\").[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-139)\n\nToday, low and middle-income groups now receive 2.5 times the public subsidies they did ten years ago.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-140)\n\nGovernment spending in Singapore has risen since the start of the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis \"2008 financial crisis\"), from around 15% of GDP in 2008 to 17% in 2012. The government's total expenditure as a percentage of GDP ranks among the lowest internationally and allows for a competitive tax regime.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-141)[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-142) Singapore is required under its constitution to keep a balanced budget over each term of government.

Its current chairman is [Lawrence Wong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Wong \"Lawrence Wong\") (July 2023–present).[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-161) It administers the various statutes pertaining to money, banking, insurance, securities and the financial sector in general, as well as [currency issuance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_dollar \"Singapore dollar\"). The MAS has been given powers to act as a banker to and financial agent of the Government. It has also been entrusted to promote monetary stability, and credit and exchange policies conducive to the growth of the economy.\n\nUnlike many other central banks such as [Federal Reserve System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System \"Federal Reserve System\"), [European Central Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank \"European Central Bank\") or [Bank of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England \"Bank of England\"), MAS does not regulate the monetary system via interest rates to influence the liquidity in the system. Instead, it chooses to do it via the foreign exchange mechanism, which it has been doing since 1981. In doing so it manages the Singapore dollar versus a number of currencies that they do not reveal publicly – a Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$ NEER). It carries this out by intervening in the SGD market as well as other operations in the money market.[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-162)[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-163) The MAS reviews its policy stance less frequently than most central banks, in a cycle that is around every 6 months.[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-164) In some circumstances, such as during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic \"COVID-19 pandemic\") MAS can change the date of its twice yearly meeting.[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore#cite_note-165)\n\nIn May 2022, six major banks agreed to pay $64.5 million to resolve antitrust allegations that they worked together to rig benchmark Singapore interest rates.

Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen have been described among the world's 50 \"superstar cities\".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-7) Surrounding the [Pearl River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta \"Pearl River Delta\") with a total area of 56,000 km 2 (comparable in size to [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia \"Croatia\")), it is the largest and the richest economic region in [South China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China \"South China\").\n\nThe GBA's combined regional [GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product \"Gross domestic product\") was RMB¥13 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) in 2022, which was equivalent to over 10 percent of GDP for all of China. As one of China's most vibrant and important regions, the GBA has the highest concentration of [Fortune 500 companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_Global_500 \"Fortune Global 500\") in the country and houses a majority of China's most innovative technology companies, such as [Huawei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei \"Huawei\"), [ZTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZTE \"ZTE\"), [DJI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJI \"DJI\"), [BYD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company \"BYD Company\"), [GAC Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_Automobile_Industry_Group \"Guangzhou Automobile Industry Group\"), and [Tencent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent \"Tencent\") (parent company of [WeChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat \"WeChat\")). GBA has a rich ecosystem of startups, incubators, and accelerators in the fields of agile tech, biotech, medical tech, and [innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation \"Innovation\"). For these reasons, many experts consider the region an emerging [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley \"Silicon Valley\") of Asia.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-8) Given traditional divisions between the provincial and municipal governments and business elites, there are some opinions that the ambitious idea behind the GBA might be difficult to implement.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-9)\n\nThe \"Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area\" is sometimes confused with the area of the [Pearl River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta \"Pearl River Delta\"), which is a term coined in 1947 referring to a smaller area.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-beltandroad.hktdc.com-10) In the early 2000s, Chinese scholars began using the term “Greater Pearl River Delta” (GPRD) which described the 9 + 2 city agglomeration that encompassed post-handover Hong Kong and Macao, conceptualized as a series of lesser cities as industrial nodes with specialist functions clustering around two prominent cores – Guangzhou and Shenzhen. In 2003, the province advocated the idea of “Pan-PRD” as an even more extensive regional construct that comprised nine neighboring provinces to promote economic cooperation.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-archdaily.com-11) A somewhat similar idea is later mentioned in the English version of China's [13th Five-Year Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_China#Thirteenth_Plan_(2016%E2%80%932020) \"Five-year plans of China\"), taking the Pearl River Delta and including the larger province of Guangdong.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-12) On 1 July 2017, the \"Framework Agreement on Deepening Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Cooperation in the Development of the Bay Area\" (深化粵港澳合作 推進大灣區建設框架協議) was signed in [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong Kong\").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-13)\n\nThe Greater Bay Area has been influenced by its coastal location for centuries. The first known ships from the area are believed to have been constructed by the people of the [Nanyue Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyue \"Nanyue\") (204–112 BCE), who employed them for cultural and economic exchanges with countries as far as present-day Vietnam. After the takeover of the Han Dynasty, trading relations expanded beyond to reach Sri Lanka. During the subsequent period of the [Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms \"Three Kingdoms\"), these trade routes were consolidated. Trade and cultural exchanges grew. Among this, the port of Guangzhou played a major role for the region's trade and cultural exchanges for over two thousand years. Established under the Kingdom of Wu during the period of the Three Kingdoms (222–280 CE), it eventually grew to become the starting point of the ancient maritime silk road during the [Eastern Jin Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Jin_Dynasty \"Eastern Jin Dynasty\") (317–420 CE). By the fourth century CE, communities of foreign merchants began establishing themselves in the city.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-14)\n\nSince the first foreign merchants have established themselves in Guangdong, the whole GBA region's importance for global trade has only increased. When Macao became a Portuguese [colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony \"Colony\") in the mid-1550s, it represented one of the first trading ports in the Far East. It was later joined by Guangzhou, whose port was the only one remaining open for foreign trade during the closure of the country under the [Qing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty \"Qing dynasty\"). The [Opium Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars \"Opium Wars\") brought Hong Kong under British control and forced the opening of other ports in the region. While their respective economic importance was subject to fluctuations later on, the establishment of special economic zones should begin to drive their economic importance anew.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-15)\n\n[Guangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou \"Guangzhou\"), the provincial capital of [Guangdong province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong \"Guangdong\"), attracted the first U.S. investments such as [Coca-Cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola \"Coca-Cola\"), [Procter & Gamble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procter_%26_Gamble \"Procter & Gamble\"), [Pepsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo \"PepsiCo\") in 1990s and to date is the most concentrated area of [U.S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States \"United States\").-financed enterprises which have invested in [southern China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_China \"Southern China\").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-16)\n\nOn 18 February 2019, the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was adopted. The ambitious goal foresees a linkage of the nine cities in Guangdong province's [Pearl River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta \"Pearl River Delta\"), [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong Kong\") and [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau \"Macau\") into an integrated economy and world-class business hub.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-ReferenceB-17) In addition, it is expected to play a key role in [Belt and Road Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative \"Belt and Road Initiative\") by connecting southern China with the countries along the [21st Century Maritime Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Maritime_Silk_Road \"21st Century Maritime Silk Road\").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-18)\n\nThe GBA is located in the southern coastal area of China, consisting of nine cities, or around 30% of the land mass, of the province of Guangdong, plus the [Special Administrative Regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Administrative_Regions \"Special Administrative Regions\") of Hong Kong and Macao.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-ReferenceA-19) Its climate ranges from humid [subtropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics \"Subtropics\") to [tropical climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate \"Tropical climate\") in the far south. There are a few [mountain ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range \"Mountain range\") collectively called the [Nanling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanling \"Nanling\") as well as a few inactive [volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanoes \"Volcanoes\") on [Leizhou Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leizhou_Peninsula \"Leizhou Peninsula\").\n\nMountain ranges and peninsulas shape the GBA. The province of Guangdong, for instance, possesses a coastline of 4,114 km (2,556 mi) due to the multiplicity of islands, bays and peninsulas. This multiplicity of small islands results from the [Pearl River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta \"Pearl River Delta\"), which is the convergent point of the East, North and West Rivers. The network of bays and rivers has contributed to the archipelagic nature of many cities within the GBA. The cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Hong Kong, and Macao for instance \"each possess constituent and distinctly islanded territorial niches that are focused on particular industrial areas.\"[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-20)\n\nThe entire area has temperate springs (March to May), hot and wet summers (June to August), clear and cool autumns (September to November), and mild, rainy winters (December to February). The annual average temperature of Guangdong Province is around 22.3°C (72.1°F), with the average temperature of 16–19°C (61–66°F) in January and 28–29°C (82–84°F) in July. However, the highest temperature in summer goes more than 35°C (95°F) and the lowest can be lower than 10°C (50°F). Temperatures in Hong Kong and Macao are nearly the same, with the annual average temperature around 23°C (73°F), a little higher due to their location more to the south and closer to the equator. GBA receives abundant amount of precipitation throughout the year.\n\nIn 2019, GBA has a total population of approximately 86.17 million people (5% of China's total population).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-Statista-6) The population is expected to reach 100 million people by 2030.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n| Cities | Urban area pop.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-2010PRCcensus-21) | District area pop.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-2010PRCcensus-21) | Administrative area pop.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-2010PRCcensus-21) | Census date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Guangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou \"Guangzhou\") | 10,641,408 | 14,904,400 | 14,904,400 | 2020-11-01 |\n| [Shenzhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen \"Shenzhen\") | 12,356,820 | 12,356,820 | 12,356,820 | 2020-11-01 |\n| [Dongguan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongguan \"Dongguan\") | 8,396,820 | 8,396,820 | 8,396,820 | 2019-11-01 |\n| [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong Kong\") | 7,515,489 | 7,515,489 | 7,515,489 | 2020-06-30 |\n| [Foshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foshan \"Foshan\") | 7,348,581 | 7,348,581 | 9,498,863 | 2020-11-01 |\n| [Zhongshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan \"Zhongshan\") | 2,913,974 | 3,121,275 | 3,121,275 | 2020-11-01 |\n| [Huizhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huizhou \"Huizhou\") | 1,807,858 | 2,344,634 | 4,598,402 | 2010-11-01 |\n| [Jiangmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangmen \"Jiangmen\") | 1,480,023 | 1,822,614 | 4,450,703 | 2010-11-01 |\n| [Zhuhai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai \"Zhuhai\") | 1,369,538 | 1,759,000 | 1,759,000 | 2020-11-01 |\n| [Zhaoqing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhaoqing \"Zhaoqing\") | 784,642 | 1,397,152 | 3,916,467 | 2010-11-01 |\n| [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau \"Macau\") | 652,032 | 652,032 | 652,032 | 2020-08-12[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-22) |\n| Total | 50,850,140 | 56,350,214 | 65,901,668 |  |\n\nThe [Ministry of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(China) \"Ministry of Education (China)\") (MOE) held a press conference on June 2, 2021, to disclose the \"Report on the Language Life Situation in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Greater Bay Area (2021)\".

Times Higher Education lists as the Top 5 of them the [University of Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hong_Kong \"University of Hong Kong\") (ranked place 39 worldwide in 2021), the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong \"Chinese University of Hong Kong\") (ranked 56 worldwide in 2021), the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_University_of_Science_and_Technology \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\") (ranked 56 worldwide in 2021), the [City University of Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_University_of_Hong_Kong \"City University of Hong Kong\") (ranked 126 worldwide in 2021) and the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Polytechnic_University \"Hong Kong Polytechnic University\") (ranked 129 worldwide in 2021).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-42)\n\nThe government seeks to enhance innovation and technology collaboration. Efforts include opening Guangdong's R&D facilities to Hong Kong institutions, supporting participation in national technology programs, and promoting cross-border R&D initiatives. Key infrastructure such as the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, five Hong Kong R&D centres, the Hong Kong Science Park, Cyberport, and State Key Laboratories are involved. The policy also facilitates the exchange of talent, access to funding, and data sharing across regions, while offering immigration and administrative support to promote cross-boundary cooperation in science and technology.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-43)\n\nGBA is rapidly evolving into the dynamic world-class [city cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_cluster \"City cluster\") connected with the modern transportation network featuring [Huangpu Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangpu_Bridge \"Huangpu Bridge\"), [Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong High-speed Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou%E2%80%93Shenzhen%E2%80%93Hong_Kong_Express_Rail_Link \"Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link\"), [Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Zhuhai%E2%80%93Macau_Bridge \"Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge\") (HZM Bridge), [Nansha Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nansha_Bridge \"Nansha Bridge\") and [Guangzhou-Shenzhen Intercity Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou%E2%80%93Shenzhen_intercity_railway \"Guangzhou–Shenzhen intercity railway\").\n\nThere are also massive ongoing [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure \"Infrastructure\") projects underway. Among them – construction of Guangzhou-Zhanjiang High-speed Railway, Gangzhou-Shenzhen Highspeed Railway and Guangzhou-Shanwei-Shantou High-speed Railway.\n\nIn 2024, the completion of several infrastructure projects in the GBA region is set to improve connectivity further. The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge, a key transportation link, is expected to open, dramatically cutting travel time across the Pearl River Delta.\n\nFurther step in GBA's infrastructure development is establishment of airport clusters. Five main airports – [Hong Kong International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_International_Airport \"Hong Kong International Airport\"), [Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_Baiyun_International_Airport \"Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport\"), [Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen_Bao%27an_International_Airport \"Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport\"), [Macau International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau_International_Airport \"Macau International Airport\") and [Zhuhai Jinwan Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai_Jinwan_Airport \"Zhuhai Jinwan Airport\")—as well as a group of feeder airports, will constitute a cluster that will be developed in two phases.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-Limited-44)\n\nPhase one, due for completion in 2025, will establish a Greater Bay Area airport conglomerate, with greater interaction between the facilities. Phase 2 aims to lift all the airports to a world-class level by 2035 with \"safe, green, smart, human and synergetic qualities\".[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-Limited-44)\n\nThe Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL) connects to the national high-speed rail network, significantly shortening the travelling time between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, Guangzhou and other cities in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, and reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a regional transportation hub. in the first six months of 2023, the Hong Kong section of the XRL recorded an average daily patronage of more than 40,000 passenger trips, with the highest number of passenger trips in a single day exceeding 90,000 passenger trips.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area#cite_note-45)\n\n*   [Huangpu Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangpu_Bridge \"Huangpu Bridge\")\n*   [Nansha Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nansha_Bridge \"Nansha Bridge\")\n*   [Humen Pearl River Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humen_Pearl_River_Bridge \"Humen Pearl River Bridge\")\n*   [Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen-Zhongshan_Bridge \"Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge\")\n*   [Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong-Zhuhai-Macau_Bridge \"Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge\")\n\n[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Greater_Bay_Area_Rail_Transit_Network.png/960px-Greater_Bay_Area_Rail_Transit_Network.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Greater_Bay_Area_Rail_Transit_Network.png \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area Rail Transit Network in 2020\")\n\nGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area Rail Transit Network in 2020\n\nUrban rail transit (including metros, commuter and regional railways) is expanding very fast.

INDUSTRIAL POLICIES AND DEVELOPMENT \n\n# PRIORITIES IN THE GREATER BAY AREA \n\n# 4.1 FOREIGN INVESTMENT POLICY \n\nOver recent years, the Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China has increasingly become a focal point for investors. The region has established itself as a center for technological advancement, finance, and trade. For instance, i n 2022, the utilized foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area reached 165.85 billion U.S. dollars. That year, FDI of around 10.63 billion U.S. dollars were utilized in Shenzhen, one of the fastest developing cities in the Greater Bay Area. \n\n## 4.1.1 Foreign investment access conditions and preferential policies \n\n4.1.1.1 Guangdong \n\nIn 2022, the Department of Commerce of Guangdong Province launched the latest edition of Invest Guangdong during the 3rd Qingdao Multinationals Summit (QMS). This guidebook serves as a comprehensive showcase of Guangdong's economic accomplishments and its enhanced business landscape, with a particular focus on key areas such as the Greater Bay Area, cooperation zones like Hengqin and Qianhai, trade, pivotal industries, and the emerging opportunities stemming from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). \n\nGuangdong has proactively reformed its market mechanisms to attract foreign investment, significantly improving market access, intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, government services, and governance based on the rule of law, all under the framework of the Foreign Investment Law of the People's Republic of China. \n\nThis legislation, effective since January 1, 2020, consolidates and replaces three previous laws on foreign investment, providing better protection for the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors while instituting more stringent regulations for the management of foreign-invested projects. \n\nUnder the new law, the process for establishing and modifying foreign-invested enterprises has been streamlined, with companies only needing to register with the Enterprise Registration System overseen by the State Administration for Market Regulation. Moreover, significant reforms have been made to sectoral restrictions and equity limits, such as the opening up of nine sectors for wholly foreign-owned enterprises and the lifting of restrictions on foreign equity limits for Chinese banks and financial asset management companies. \n\nAdditionally, the Foreign Investment Law facilitates increased collaboration between law firms from Hong Kong or Macao and those from mainland China, along with trials of Hong Kong's management model in engineering construction. To incentivize significant foreign investment, various financial incentives have been introduced, including guaranteed returns from provincial finance funds, support for projects by Fortune Global 500 companies and global industry leaders, and one-time awards for foreign-funded multinational corporations contributing significantly to provincial finances. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 20 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\nFurthermore, measures have been implemented to bolster the management of land use, particularly for manufacturing projects with substantial foreign investment and the establishment of headquarters or regional headquarters for major multinational corporations. \n\n4.1.1.2 Macao \n\nMacau has the status of a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), established through a joint declaration between Portugal and the PRC in 1987. \n\nThe region boasts minimal tariffs and restrictions, offering a favorable business climate for foreign investors. The absence of foreign exchange controls on current capital international transactions further facilitates investment activities. Macau operates its own independent public finance system and enjoys a degree of self-governance, although foreign and defense affairs fall under the responsibility of the central PRC government. \n\nEconomically, Macau's reliance on tourism, particularly gaming, and light manufacturing, including textiles and garments, presents profitable opportunities for investors. Notably, the gaming sector dominates inward foreign direct investment (FDI), reflecting its significance in Macau's economy. \n\nDespite its attractiveness to foreign investors, Macau lacks specific foreign investment legislation, and there are generally no restrictions on foreign investment. Both overseas and domestic corporations are subject to the same regulatory framework, primarily governed by the Macau Commercial Code. However, certain sectors, such as education, legal services, and newspapers, have limited foreign control limits. \n\nForeign investors commonly establish their presence in Macau through local branches. This process involves registering with the Macau Commercial and Moveable Properties Registry and fulfilling key requirements, including reserving a name, appointing a representative with permanent residence in Macau, and submitting necessary documentation such as the Incorporation Act of the foreign company and a list of directors. \n\nIn summary, Macau's political stability, favorable business environment, and thriving economic sectors make it an attractive destination for foreign investors seeking opportunities in gaming, tourism, and light manufacturing industries. While the absence of specific foreign investment legislation may raise questions for some investors, the region's overall openness to foreign investment and transparent regulatory framework contribute to its appeal as an investment destination. \n\n4.1.1.3 Hongkong \n\nHong Kong, designated as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China since July 1, 1997, operates under the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" as established in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Recent developments, such as China's imposition of the National Security Law on June 30, have raised concerns about Hong Kong's autonomy. This law has heightened uncertainty for both foreign and local businesses, potentially subjecting them to increased surveillance and arbitrary law enforcement. U.S. citizens in Hong Kong may face heightened scrutiny and the risk of detention for reasons beyond maintaining law and order. \n\nDespite these challenges, Hong Kong maintains a commitment to a free market philosophy with minimal government intervention. The Hong Kong Government (HKG) generally welcomes foreign investment, providing equal opportunities for both foreign controlled and locally controlled //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 21 of 41\n\ncompanies. Foreign firms and individuals can establish operations in Hong Kong without discrimination, facing straightforward reporting requirements and no ownership restrictions. \n\nDespite its relatively small population, Hong Kong remains a significant destination for U.S. investment and trade. It ranks as the fifteenth-largest export market for the U.S., with notable strengths in agricultural products and high-value consumer goods. The city's economy, valued at nearly USD 368 billion in 2019, is primarily driven by competitive financial and professional services, trading, logistics, and tourism sectors. Hong Kong continues to host numerous regional headquarters of multinational companies, including over 1,400 U.S. firms, with finance and related services companies dominating the landscape, including operations of many of the world's largest banks. \n\n## 4.1.2 Industry focus and encouragement direction \n\nComprising nine cities in the Pearl River Delta and two administrative regions, the GBA boasts a population of over 70 million and is a crucial contributor to China's economy. The GBA plan, introduced in 2019, delineates a roadmap for transforming the region into a globally competitive, connected, and innovative mega-region by 2035. \n\n• Strategic Priorities of the GBA Plan :\n\no International Innovation and Technology Hub: One of the primary focuses is to nurture an international hub for innovation and technology. This involves advancing new pillar industries such as information technology, biotechnology, and high-end manufacturing, with key hubs established in cities like Hong Kong and Shenzhen. \n\no Infrastructure Connectivity : The GBA prioritizes infrastructure development to facilitate seamless connectivity. With well-developed ports and airports, the aim is to optimize the flow of people, goods, information, and capital through modern transport and information infrastructure. \n\no Globally Competitive Business Environment : Efforts are underway to foster a globally competitive business environment across the region. Despite challenges stemming from differing legal systems and economic structures, initiatives seek to enhance the overall business landscape. \n\n• Foreign Investment Opportunities :\n\no The ambitious infrastructure ventures in the region, including high-speed railways, airports, and cross-border connectivity projects, present lucrative prospects for foreign investors seeking to expand transportation and logistics networks. \n\no Additionally, the increasing demand for both commercial and residential properties, fueled by urbanization, demographic shifts, and sustained economic growth, makes real estate an attractive sector for deploying foreign capital over the long term. \n\no Furthermore, the evolution of the GBA into a prominent global technology and innovation center offers investment opportunities for foreign entities. Shenzhen, often referred to as China's Silicon Valley, has become a frontrunner in technology //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 22 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\nand hardware manufacturing, attracting interest from tech giants, startups, and research institutions worldwide. The region's commitment to fostering a dynamic innovation ecosystem through collaboration, incentives for research and development, and technology exchange programs positions it as a pivotal destination for foreign investors who intend to access China's thriving tech sector. \n\nIn summary, the GBA initiative's strategic priorities encompass the development of an international innovation hub, infrastructure connectivity, and the creation of a globally competitive business environment. These priorities, coupled with ambitious infrastructure projects and the region's emergence as a technology and innovation center, present enticing opportunities for foreign investment in sectors ranging from transportation and logistics to real estate and technology. This convergence towards globalization, connectivity, infrastructure, and innovation underscores the GBA's significance as a focal point for international investment and economic development. \n\n# 4.2 TAXATION AND FINANCIAL POLICIES \n\n## 4.2.1 Tax preferential policies and tax transparency \n\nThe Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has distinctive qualities that bear promise for its development. Upon the basis of “one country, two systems”, the GBA consists of three customs territories and four core cities. As compared to other development areas, it is uniquely positioned geographically and has the unusual advantage of a fused eastern and western heritage. Along with mutual access to its financial markets, a good ecology, a thriving capital market, and generations of multilingual professional talent, the GBA offers favorable conditions for entrepreneurs to succeed in enterprise and wealth creation. The sustainable development of family enterprises in the private economy also encourages stability and growth in the GBA. \n\n4.2.1.1 IIT (Individual Income Tax) \n\nIn an attempt to attract more foreign professionals to work in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), a Notice was jointly issued on March 14, 2019, by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation, granting Individual Income Tax (IIT) subsidies to overseas high-end talent and those in short supply working in the GBA (Circular 31). Following the essence of Circular 31, the Department of Finance of Guangdong Province and the Guangdong Provincial Tax Service under the State Administration of Taxation released a Notice on Implementing the IIT Preferential Policies in the GBA on June 22, 2019. These IIT preferential policies have been in place in Hengqin, the New District of Zhuhai, and the Qianhai District of Shenzhen since 2013. Now, they have expanded to cover nine cities in the GBA, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Zhaoqing. \n\nThe GBA IIT subsidy aims to support overseas high-end and in-demand talent working in the Greater Bay Area. Under this program, the portion of IIT paid by an individual in one of the nine mainland cities of the GBA, exceeding the initial 15 percent of their taxable income, is subsidized by the respective municipal government. This subsidy is also exempt from further IIT. The subsidy is capped at RMB 5 million (approximately US$691,266) per taxpayer in a given tax year (China’s tax year runs from January 1 to December 31). \n\nThe IIT preferential policies implemented in the nine GBA cities effectively balance the tax rate between Hong Kong salaries tax and IIT by providing subsidies to taxpayers. Initially set to expire //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 23 of 41\n\nby the end of 2023, the subsidy is now extended until 2027. Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance issued a notice to the municipal governments of the nine mainland GBA cities, initiating the procedures for the subsidy once again. \n\n• Benefits \n\nEligible persons working in the GBA can obtain financial subsidies from the local governments in the form of IIT rebate. The rebate is calculated as the difference between the actual IIT paid by the applicant and 15 percent of his/her taxable income and it will not be treated as taxable income in the hands of the taxpayers. The tax rate for an ordinary taxpayer is 45%, while the part above the 15% tax rate for the eligible person can be subsidized by the government. In other words, qualified persons can receive IIT subsidies of RMB 300,000 each year. \n\n• Eligibility \n\nThe IIT preferential subsidies for eligible applicants in the GBA are made for overseas high-end talent or talent in short supply who work in specific mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and meet certain criteria set by municipal governments. To qualify, individuals must be permanent residents of Hong Kong or Macao, Hong Kong residents with residency through specific programs, residents of Taiwan, foreign nationals, mainland Chinese returnees, or overseas Chinese with long-term residence abroad. They must also work and pay taxes in one of the nine designated mainland cities, adhere to laws and regulations, and scientific research ethics, and be skilled in scientific and technological innovation, key development industries, or philosophy and social sciences as defined in each city's talent catalog. \n\n4.2.1.2 Consumption tax \n\nConsumption tax applies to both entities and individuals engaged in the production, processing, contract work, or importation of goods subject to consumption tax regulations in China, as well as those selling such goods as specified by the State Council. These entities and individuals are considered consumption taxpayers and are required to remit consumption tax in accordance with the regulations. \n\nTaxable items include cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, cosmetics, fine jewelry, fireworks, refined oil products, luxury watches, yachts, motorcycles, tires, small cars, golf equipment, disposable wooden chopsticks, and wood floor panels. \n\nTax rates for consumption items are determined by the Schedule of Consumption Tax Items and Rates, employing either proportional tax rates ranging from 5% to 35% or specific tax amounts ranging from RMB 0.1 to 250. \n\nThe payable amount of consumption tax is calculated based on volume, value, or a combination of both methods. For volume-based taxation, the tax payable equals the sales value multiplied by the proportional tax rate. For value-based taxation, the tax payable equals the quantity of sales multiplied by the specific tax. For a combination method, the tax payable equals the sales value multiplied by the proportional tax rate plus the quantity of sales multiplied by the specific tax. \n\nTaxes payable on sales of taxable goods are calculated in renminbi. If calculated in a currency other than renminbi, it must be converted. Taxes payable on imported taxable goods are calculated based on the composite taxable value. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 24 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\nExport policies include exemptions and rebates for foreign trade enterprises exporting goods, exemptions without rebates for goods produced by enterprises with export rights, and no exemptions or rebates for goods exported by other commercial enterprises. \n\nEnterprises producing low-emission saloon cars, off-road vehicles, and minibuses receive a 30% reduction in consumption tax payable. \n\nFrom August 1, 2021, value-added tax and consumption tax can be declared together with urban maintenance and construction tax, education surcharges, and local education surcharges. Forms for Value-Added Tax and Surcharges Return and Consumption Tax and Surcharges Return have also been introduced. \n\n4.2.1.3 Stamp tax \n\nThe stamp tax applies to both entities and individuals engaged in the execution of taxable certificates or securities transactions within Mainland China. Additionally, entities or individuals outside Mainland China involved in the execution of taxable certificates utilized within Mainland China are also subject to stamp tax obligations. These taxpayers are required to comply with the regulations outlined in the Stamp Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China. \n\n\"Taxable certificates\" encompass contracts, property rights transfer certificates, and business account books specified in the Table of Taxable Items and Tax Rates attached to the Stamp Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China. \"Securities transactions\" denote the transfer of stocks and stock-based depositary receipts traded on legally recognized stock exchanges and other nationwide securities trading venues approved by the State Council. \n\nCalculation and tax rates are determined according to the Table of Taxable Items and Tax Rates attached to the Stamp Tax Law. Stamp tax payable is computed by multiplying the tax basis by the applicable tax rate. The tax basis includes: \n\n• The contract amount, excluding listed value-added tax, for taxable contracts, \n\n• The amount listed in property rights transfer certificates, excluding listed value-added tax, for taxable property rights transfer certificates, \n\n• The aggregate of paid-up capital (capital stock) plus recorded capital reserves in business account books for taxable business account books, \n\n• The transaction value for securities transactions. \n\nCertain documents are exempt from stamp tax, such as duplicates or transcripts of taxable certificates, certificates concluded by foreign embassies, consulates, or representative offices of international organizations in China for premises acquisition, contracts by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army and the Chinese People’s Armed Police Force, sales contracts for agricultural means of production or agricultural products, and interest-free loan contracts. \n\nMoreover, the State Council has the authority to prescribe stamp tax reduction or exemption in specific cases to address national economic and social development needs, such as meeting housing demands, enterprise restructuring, bankruptcy, and supporting small and micro-//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 25 of 41\n\nenterprise development. These reductions or exemptions must be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress for record-keeping. \n\n## 4.2.2 Talent introduction and training policy \n\nIn January 2024, Hong Kong and Guangdong province signed a framework agreement with the aim of fostering the movement of talent and establishing a coordination mechanism to construct a high-quality talent hub within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. \n\nThe signing event took place in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, and was attended by Chan Kwok-ki, chief secretary for administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, along with Cheng Fubo, a member of the Standing Committee and director of the Organization Department, as well as director of the Talent Work Leading Group Office of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee. \n\nThe agreement's objective is to facilitate the diverse flow of talents within the Greater Bay Area, ushering in new opportunities to attract high-caliber professionals to the region. \n\nHong Kong's efforts in implementing various policy initiatives to attract and retain talent have shown significant outcomes. By late last year, the city had received over 220,000 applications across various talent admission schemes. Of these, more than 130,000 applications were approved, leading to the arrival of approximately 90,000 professionals in Hong Kong. Notably, the Top Talent Pass Scheme, which targets experienced professionals with strong academic backgrounds worldwide, received 65,000 applications, with over 50,000 approvals. \n\nIn Macau, the Special Administrative Region (SAR) has established a Talent Recruitment System focus on boosting innovation, competitiveness, and international recognition. The Macao SAR government intends to leverage the expertise, experience, and networks of top talents to foster the development of key local industries, thereby achieving economic diversification and sustainable growth. This system comprises three distinct programs: the High-end Talents Program, the Outstanding Talents Program, and the Advanced Professionals Program. \n\nTo support the young people attracted by the opportunities proposed in the GBA, Guangdong province has introduced supportive policies aimed at attracting more youths from Hong Kong and Macao to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), according to Hong Kong youths. The policies include mentorship services, work subsidies, and support for entrepreneurs. Mentors with experience on the Chinese mainland will assist young people from Hong Kong and Macao in nine cities of the GBA. Qualified youths will receive a grassroots work subsidy, while subsidies and support will be provided for entrepreneurs setting up businesses in the mainland part of the GBA. These measures are seen as innovative and practical, with the potential to encourage more enterprises to hire young people from Hong Kong and Macao. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, interest among Hong Kong youths to pursue careers in GBA cities is increasing. Suggestions have been made for further policy improvements, such as implementing a credit system to incentivize longer stays in the GBA. Overall, these policies reflect the government's commitment to providing opportunities for Hong Kong and Macao youths and promoting their integration into the mainland's development. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 26 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\n## 4.2.3 Scientific and technological innovation support and scientific \n\n## research cooperation mechanism \n\nThe Guangdong Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin has introduced comprehensive measures to promote technological innovation, spanning six key areas. These measures aim to collaborate with Macao, establish innovation platforms, nurture enterprises, support R&D, foster international cooperation, and create a favorable environment for innovation. \n\nKey initiatives include supporting industry-university-research bases, funding major innovation platforms, incentivizing international competitions, boosting R&D investment, and offering subsidies for tech institutions. The focus is on stimulating innovation, attracting projects, and enhancing collaboration in industries like integrated circuits, new materials, and AI. \n\nSimilarly, the government in Hong Kong is prioritizing innovation and technology (I&T) development, with investments exceeding $100 billion. Efforts include establishing research clusters, promoting collaboration with institutions like the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and enhancing cross-border cooperation with the mainland. \n\nInitiatives such as the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, the Technology Talent Admission Scheme, and the Smart City Blueprint demonstrate a commitment to fostering innovation, attracting talent, and improving quality of life through I&T adoption. \n\nThe development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is a crucial decision by the CPC Central Committee led by Xi Jinping, planning on fostering high-quality development, enhancing competitiveness, and bolstering innovation. It serves strategic goals such as regional coordination, open economic systems, and supporting initiatives like the Belt and Road. \n\nEfforts are underway to strengthen scientific and technological capabilities, with initiatives like the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong and Guangzhou-Zhuhai-Macao innovation corridors and the establishment of major research platforms. Measures to improve the innovation environment involve facilitating cross-border flows of innovation factors, funding scientific research, simplifying import/export procedures, and offering tax incentives to attract talent. The Outline Development Plan, released in 2019, highlights innovation as a key focus. \n\nAnother plan to enhance scientific research cooperation is the Guangdong-Hong Kong Technology Cooperation Funding Scheme (TCFS). Since 2004, it has been promoting advanced technology and technological transfer between Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Shenzhen, aiming to boost productivity and competitiveness in both regions. \n\nSince 2018, Hong Kong institutions can directly apply for science and technology funding at the state level in Shenzhen and Guangdong. Several Hong Kong research institutes have already received funds for R&D projects. Additionally, a memorandum signed in 2017 paved the way for the development of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, a significant innovation hub. The Co-operation Arrangement signed in 2021 further strengthens collaboration between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, facilitating talent and resource exchange and promoting innovation and technology development in the Greater Bay Area. \n\nIn recent years, Hong Kong and mainland China have been implementing measures to facilitate the exchange of personal information within the GBA, leading to increased industrial collaboration //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 27 of 41\n\nin the region. Collaboration between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments strive to align the development of innovation parks, easing the movement of resources between the two cities. \n\nAs Guangdong undergoes industrial transformation, its demand for research and technology input is rising. Hong Kong's industry can utilize Guangdong's advanced manufacturing capacity to support local scientific research while also providing technical solutions and applications to GBA-based businesses. \n\nTo establish itself as a leading international innovation and technology center, Hong Kong's government is encouraging local investment in data facilities, strengthening personnel training, and improving the business environment. Joint initiatives between Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments intend to promote talent, capital, data, and sample exchange, fostering cooperation in the technology industry. \n\nMeanwhile, Guangdong's industry sector has been expanding steadily, with a focus on factory automation, supply chain optimization, and R&D to boost competitiveness. Clusters like Qianhai in Shenzhen and Nansha in Guangzhou offer incentive policies to attract tech companies and talents, driving technological innovation and industrial transformation in the region. \n\nHong Kong companies can leverage these incentives and tap into GBA resources to expand their technology business. By providing expertise in foreign advanced technologies, international standards, and commercialization, Hong Kong can play an active role in driving industrial upgrades in the GBA. Close attention to sector developments is advised to seize business opportunities arising from Guangdong-Hong Kong collaboration. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 28 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\n# 5. INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN THE GUANGDONG -HONG \n\n# KONG -MACAO GREATER BAY AREA \n\nA significant milestone has been achieved in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) with the initiation of Phase One operations of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Logistics Park Project. This marks a crucial step forward in line with the \"Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\" Situated strategically in Zhuhai's Hezhou New Area, the project spans an extensive area of 128,000 square meters. \n\nThe objective of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Logistics Park is to establish a global supply chain service center, integrating logistics management, supply chain finance, information consulting, and professional services.

With a workforce exceeding 277,000 individuals in the financial industry, accounting for 7.6% of the working population, it's a significant contributor to Hong Kong's GDP, representing 21.3%. \n\nThe city's strategic location at the heart of Asia fosters close financial integration with Mainland China and extensive global networks. Leveraging its sound legal system, competitive tax regime, and free flow of capital, Hong Kong offers a diverse range of financial products and boasts a large pool of financial talents. \n\nChina's rapid growth and opening-up present undeniable opportunities, with the country poised to constitute 20% of global GDP by 2030. Hong Kong, as the gateway to Mainland China and the global hub for offshore renminbi business, facilitates a substantial portion of China's inward and outward direct investments. \n\nFurthermore, Hong Kong's strengths in banking, capital markets, and asset management position it as an all-encompassing financial platform for global investors and institutions. This status extends to corporate treasury centers, which favor Hong Kong as a preferred location. \n\nTo enhance its competitiveness further, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established a Market Outreach division, seeking to engage with stakeholders to capitalize on growth opportunities. These opportunities include Mainland China's financial markets, green finance, and fintech, leveraging Hong Kong's world-class financial infrastructure. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 31 of 41\n\nLooking ahead, Hong Kong positions itself as a forward-looking hub, seizing opportunities from initiatives like the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) and the Greater Bay Area (GBA). The BRI, focusing on connectivity and investment, aligns with Hong Kong's international expertise and network. Similarly, the GBA, comprising Hong Kong, Macao, and nine Mainland cities, offers significant economic potential, particularly in fintech and infrastructure, which Hong Kong's financial services sector is poised to leverage. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 32 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\n# 6. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS \n\n# 6.1 MAJOR PROJECTS AND POLICY ADJUSTMENTS \n\n## 6.1.1 New industrial parks and development projects \n\nOn January 19, 2024, Guangdong unveiled the Regulations on Promoting High-Quality Development of the Manufacturing Industry in Guangdong, effective from March 1, 2024, encompassing 44 articles across 6 chapters. They aim to advance new industrialization, focusing on areas such as manufacturing industry development, investment promotion, factor allocation, and supportive services. \n\nKey highlights include emphasis on high-end, intelligent, green, and clustered manufacturing development. Guangdong plans to facilitate the sharing of scientific research infrastructure with manufacturing enterprises and support order-based R&D projects.

Support will be extended to parks outside the Pearl River Delta region to accommodate industrial transfers. \n\nAside from that, the Guangdong-Hong-Kong-Macao Logistics Park, located in Zhuhai's Hezhou New Area and with an operational start on September 14, 2023, is a significant development in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and plans to become a global supply chain center. \n\nThe logistics park, strategically positioned along the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge extension line, is crucial for deepening cooperation between Zhuhai, Macao, and Hong Kong, creating new collaboration opportunities. It's located only 13 kilometers from the Zhuhai land port of the bridge and 10 kilometers from Macao, making it a key logistics hub. \n\nPhase I focuses on enhancing trade efficiency, particularly with the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, and includes bonded and export supervision warehouses. It hopes to foster a \"Westward Expansion\" channel, boosting regional trade. Phase II, planned for full operation in early 2024, expands the park's capabilities, incorporating customs innovations for streamlined clearance. \n\nThe park's significance extends to cross-border e-commerce exports, exemplified by a vehicle departing from the park in March 2024. According to the operating company's expectations, the park's import-export value is projected to reach 1 billion RMB, with plans to expand into express delivery, e-commerce, and cold chain logistics to double its value in two years. It's expected to save exporters in western Guangdong over 90 minutes compared to traditional channels. \n\nWith its integration of logistics control, supply chain finance, and professional services, the logistics park enhances transportation efficiency, offering quick access to Macao and Hong Kong airports. This development underscores the region's commitment to economic growth and global trade integration. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 33 of 41\n\n## 6.1.2 Policy adjustments and improvement of investment environment \n\nIn December 2023, the NDRC unveiled the Three-Year Action Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area aims to enhance the region's financial sector openness and market access.

FUTURE OUTLOOK AND SUGGESTIONS \n\n# 7.1 DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS OF THE GREATER BAY AREA \n\n## 7.1.1 Regional integration and economic growth expectations \n\nThe Greater Bay Area (GBA), encompassing Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao, is a crucial driver of economic growth in China, contributing significantly to exports and GDP despite covering just 1% of China's land area. With the full reopening of cross-border activities between Hong Kong and the mainland, the GBA is expected to experience a rebound, with increased demand for cross-border financial services. \n\nIndustries like high-tech manufacturing and the digital economy are flourishing in the GBA, attracting investment interest from both local and overseas enterprises. Hong Kong, positioned as an international financial hub within the GBA, plays a vital role in facilitating cross-border trade and financial services, aided by initiatives like the HSBC Merchant Box for SMEs. \n\nFurthermore, Hong Kong wants to enhance its role as an international innovation and technology hub, leveraging its competitive advantages and collaborating closely with neighboring cities like Shenzhen. Initiatives such as the HSBC GBA Sustainability Fund reflect the region's commitment to sustainable development and green finance. \n\nStrategic partnerships between institutions like HSBC and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) are formed to provide comprehensive support to businesses, including market insights, networking events, and specialized services, to capitalize on the growth opportunities presented by the GBA. \n\nThe Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is a region with significant economic vitality and openness. The National Development and Reform Commission released a \"Three-year Action Plan for the Development of International First-class Business Environment in the GBA\" to enhance its competitiveness globally. The plan intend to establish a world-class business environment within the GBA by aligning policies and mechanisms with international standards. \n\nAccording to the plan, the GBA contributes 11% of China’s GDP, with a GDP exceeding RMB13 trillion in 2022. The plan is a follow-up to the \"Outline Development Plan for the GBA\" released in 2019, emphasizing the importance of constructing a globally competitive business environment. \n\nKey objectives of the action plan include optimizing market access, enhancing government services, improving the legal environment, and fostering openness within the GBA. Specific measures will be taken to relax market access in designated zones like the Hengqin Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone and Guangzhou Nansha. Additionally, the plan aims to assess the effectiveness of market access across GBA cities and study the relaxation of restrictions on Hong Kong and Macao investors. \n\nEfforts will be made to attract foreign investment, establish headquarters of multinational companies, and improve market integration through \"Bay Area Connect Schemes.\" Financial market connectivity will be enhanced by expanding the financial industry opening to Hong Kong and Macao, promoting cooperation between stock exchanges, and implementing Southbound Bond Connect. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 36 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\nFurthermore, the plan proposes exploring cross-border credit reporting cooperation and supporting Hong Kong and Macao financial institutions to operate in the GBA. Overall, the action plan seeks to unleash market vitality, strengthen global resource mobilization, and enhance the GBA's competitiveness in the global business environment. \n\n## 7.1.2 Future development opportunities for Belgian companies \n\nThe 14th Five-Year-Plan of China, spanning from 2021 to 2025, outlines a comprehensive strategy directed toward positioning the nation as a global technology powerhouse. Emphasizing innovation, automation, and the strengthening of China's industrial supply chain, the plan seeks to drive economic growth. Key elements include fostering self-reliance and self-improvement in science and technology to achieve high-income status by leveraging technology across industries. \n\nDespite China's advancements in digital and green infrastructure, there's a continued need for foreign expertise, particularly in areas with technology gaps. This presents opportunities for European tech companies, given the evolving dynamics of international trade. \n\nFIT's (Flanders Investment & Trade) proactive approach involves establishing a Science &Technology Office in Guangzhou's Greater Bay Area. This serves as a strategic hub to facilitate collaboration for Flanders' tech companies across China and attract R&D investment from Chinese partners, focusing on Digital Tech, Climate Tech, and Health Tech. \n\nHealth Tech holds promise for Flemish biotech and biopharma companies, with opportunities for collaboration with China in clinical trial developments. FIT organizes matchmaking events and missions to China to facilitate networking and partnerships between Flemish and Chinese companies. \n\nFIT's extended partnership with the Belgian-Chinese Chamber of Commerce (BCECC) strives to foster long-term collaborative relationships between Belgium and China, promoting trade, investment, and technological exchange. \n\nThe Greater Bay Area initiative links key cities in South China to create an integrated economic zone focused on innovation and technology. With 11% of China's GDP and a population of 86 million, the GBA demonstrates consistent GDP growth across its cities. \n\nHong Kong, Macao, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen play pivotal roles in the GBA. Hong Kong and Shenzhen rank among the top for GDP per capita. The \"Twin Cities, Three Circles\" strategy promotes collaboration and development between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, focusing on economic, technological, and tourism development. \n\nDevelopment plans aim to deepen integration and connectivity within the GBA, fostering economic growth, innovation, and a high quality of life for residents. \n\n# 7.2 PARTICIPATION SUGGESTIONS AND STRATEGIES \n\nEntrepreneurial Dynamics in the Greater Bay Area Entrepreneurs within the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China confront multifaceted challenges as they strive to ensure the sustainable development of family enterprises amidst the region's economic vibrancy. The GBA, comprising Guangdong Province, Hong Kong, and Macau, is a vital economic powerhouse, contributing significantly to China's GDP, with a notable 10.73% share in 2021. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> July 2024 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area page 37 of 41\n\nWithin this dynamic landscape, distinct categories of entrepreneurs have emerged, reflecting the diverse socioeconomic fabric of the region. These include wealth creators, individuals who have amassed substantial fortunes through astute business acumen; highly educated elites, equipped with advanced academic credentials and global perspectives; and next-generation leaders, who inherit and steer family enterprises toward continued success. \n\nThe historical legacy of the GBA as a hub for trade, combined with its favorable business environment, has fostered the rise of influential entrepreneurs commonly referred to as the \"Cantonese Merchants.\" Since China's economic reforms and opening-up policies, the GBA has experienced unprecedented growth, fueled by its strategic geographic location, robust infrastructure, and supportive government initiatives. Consequently, the region has become a magnet for large-scale enterprises, with its cities collectively contributing significantly to China's overall GDP. \n\nHowever, despite the region's economic prowess, entrepreneurs in the GBA encounter a myriad of challenges, particularly in navigating disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these entrepreneurs oversee family businesses characterized by the involvement of multiple generations. Achieving sustainable development in such enterprises necessitates striking a delicate balance between personal aspirations, familial dynamics, and business imperatives. \n\nNevertheless, amidst these challenges, the allure of the GBA for entrepreneurial endeavors remains undeniable. The region continues to offer abundant opportunities for growth, innovation, and collaboration across various sectors, making it an attractive destination for ambitious. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   \n\n> page 38 of 41 Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area July 2024\n\n# 8.

It argues that, since this country's independence in the 1960s, its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have both been run in a manner conducive to commercial viability and highly aligned with governmental economic priorities. This ‘commercially viable strategic alignment’, largely absent in SOEs worldwide, has favored cautious privatization and thus the maintenance of a strong SOE sector in Singapore. While recent political backlash from investing abroad has led the government to apparently distance itself from SOEs and Temasek – the SOE-holding-company-turned-investment-fund – their role in developing venture capital and entrepreneurship – both governmental priorities – suggests that a ‘strategic alignment’ remains. Drawing from their substantial financial resources, these entities complement other government efforts in terms of funding, being important players in the Singaporean venture capital markets and have even directly and indirectly invested in Singapore's most successful high-growth companies. In addition, due to their presence in global networks and the complimentary assets they possess, such as access to customers and intellectual property, they provide investees with resources that facilitate their growth and increase their likelihood of succeeding.\n\nSuggested Citation\n------------------\n\nDownload full text from publisher\n---------------------------------\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to\n\nfor a different version of it.\n\nReferences listed on IDEAS\n--------------------------\n\n1.

Most existing studies on the convergence and competition of the manufacturing structure in the Greater Bay Area lack a comprehensive measurement and analysis from the perspective of the metropolitan circle by using multiple indicators in multiple dimensions, especially the intra-city division of labor. \n\nThis paper addresses the gap by examining the structural convergence, industrial competition, and cooperation networks, specialization, and labor division in the manufacturing sector of mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area for the years 2011, 2016, and 2021. The findings are as follows. 1) There are varying degrees of convergence among mainland cities, with the Guangzhou and Shenzhen metropolitan circles showing significant convergence. This is primarily driven by intra-industry labor division and industrial chain cooperation between core and cooperative cities within these metropolitan circles. 2) Industrial competition in the Greater Bay Area manifests as horizontal competition between cities of similar economic levels, both within and across city circles. Conversely, industrial cooperation appears as a vertical collaboration between core and cooperative cities, predominantly within metropolitan areas. Horizontal competition has diminished while vertical cooperation has strengthened. 3) The convergence and cooperation within the Greater Bay Area are significantly influenced by the strengthening of metropolitan circle connections, the radiating and driving roles of core cities, geographical proximity, and the positive impact of Hong Kong and Macao.\n\nThis paper extends existing literature in three aspects. 1) Utilizing multiple indicators, the paper offers a thorough investigation into the convergence and evolution of manufacturing structures in mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area, thus enriching research on industrial structure convergence. 2) This paper distinguishes the structural similarity and changes among the three metropolitan circles within the Greater Bay Area, focusing on core and collaborative cities as well as cities of similar economic levels. 3) It not only compares the industrial structure horizontally across the Greater Bay Area but also evaluates the vertical industrial division among mainland cities using multi-regional input-output tables from relevant years.\n\nThe conclusions provide valuable insights and empirical evidence for shaping industrial development policies and regional integration strategies in the Greater Bay Area, highlighting the dynamic interplay between competition and cooperation in fostering regional economic growth.\n\n### **Key words**\n\nGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area / industrial competition and collaboration / metropolitan circle / industrial structure convergence [{{custom_keyword}}](javascript:;)/\n\n### **Cite this article**\n\nDownload Citations\n\nYANG Yaping, QIN Ning.

By 1985 it had become a modern metropolis with more than 80% of its residents living in public housing. This globally unparalleled transformation was achieved through compulsory, often controversial, land acquisition and resettlement. The policy remains central to Singapore's urban planning and development. The Land Acquisition Act (LAA) was passed in 1966, the year after Singapore became independent. It gave the government sweeping powers to acquire vast amounts of private land at below-market rates. Spaces for public housing, industrial parks and infrastructure were obtained quickly as the state's decisions could not be challenged in court. Early acquisitions were primarily for public housing built by the Housing Development Board (HDB). They went hand in hand with resettlement, which was largely accomplished without serious public backlash. The policy dovetailed with founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on home ownership for building a stakeholder society. He encouraged this by allowing Singaporeans to use their Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to make down payments, and the HDB offered subsidised mortages.\n\n[Download PDF [PDF, 8.1 MB]](https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/50/aac3af3c-1e66-411c-93eb-41c12cd6730f/uss-land-acquisition-and-resettlement.pdf)\n\nBack to\n\n[Publications library](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/)\n\nOther pages in Publications library\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   [“Urbanisation is Not An Accident”](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/urbanisation-is-not-an-accident/)\n\n*   [10 Principles for Liveable High Density Cities Lessons from Singapore](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/10-principles-for-liveable-high-density-cities-lessons-from-singapore/)\n\n*   [13th Asia Smart City Conference ASCC in Yokohama, Japan, 22-24 Oct 2024](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/13th-asia-smart-city-conference--yokohama--japan--22-24-oct-2024/)\n\n*   [50 Years of Urban Planning in Singapore](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/50-years-of-urban-planning-in-singapore/)\n\n*   [200 Years of Singapore and the United Kingdom](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/200-years-of-singapore-and-the-united-kingdom/)\n\n*   [A Better World: Sustainable Cities and Communities](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/a-better-world-sustainable-cities-and-communities/)\n\n*   [A Chance of a Lifetime: Lee Kuan Yew and the Physical Transformation of Singapore](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/a-chance-of-a-lifetime-lee-kuan-yew-and-the-physical-transformation-of-singapore/)\n\n*   [A City in Blue and Green - The Singapore Story](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/a-city-in-blue-and-green-the-singapore-story/)\n\n*   [A City of Culture: Planning for the Arts](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/a-city-of-culture-planning-for-the-arts/)\n\n*   [A City-to-City Exchange](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/a-city-to-city-exchange/)\n\n[See all pages](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/)\n\n[Back to top](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications-library/land-acquisition-and-resettlement-securing-resources-for-development#)\n\nCentre for Liveable Cities Knowledge Hub\n----------------------------------------\n\n[Publications](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications/)\n\n### Reach us\n\n[](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/clcsg)[](https://www.facebook.com/CLCsg/)[](https://www.youtube.com/@CentreforLiveableCities)\n\n[Contact](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/contact-us/)[Feedback](https://www.form.gov.sg/)\n\n© 2025 Government of Singapore, last updated 15 August 2025\n\n[Report Vulnerability](https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability)[Privacy Statement](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/privacy-statement/)[Terms of Use](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/terms-of-use/)[REACH](https://www.reach.gov.sg/)\n\n[Made with Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/)[Built by Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/)\n\nCentre for Liveable Cities Knowledge Hub\n----------------------------------------\n\n[Publications](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/publications/)\n\n### Reach us\n\n[](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/clcsg)[](https://www.facebook.com/CLCsg/)[](https://www.youtube.com/@CentreforLiveableCities)\n\n[Contact](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/contact-us/)[Feedback](https://www.form.gov.sg/)\n\n© 2025 Government of Singapore, last updated 15 August 2025\n\n[Report Vulnerability](https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability)[Privacy Statement](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/privacy-statement/)[Terms of Use](https://knowledgehub.clc.gov.sg/terms-of-use/)[REACH](https://www.reach.gov.sg/)\n\n[Made with Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/)[Built by Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/)\n",

Unfortunately, the fact that the concept of compulsory land acquisition is getting substantial recognition in countries having social orders that are opposed to each other would appear to have exposed the futility of their efforts. What is nearer to the truth is that compulsory land acquisition, like many other legal and sociological concepts espoused by political elites all over the world seek-ing a happy medium between the extremes of all-private and all-State ownership, is borne of practical necessity rather than any socialistic theory. That land acquisition is for public benefit does not necessarily mean it will create a wider diffusion of ownership. It would therefore appear more appropriate and safer if one stops at such abstract but convenient maxims like salus populi est suprema lex (that the welfare of the people or of the public is the paramount law) and necessitas publica major est quam privata (public necessity is greater than private). About 140 years ago, when the East India Company was the overlord in the Colony of Singapore, the general land policy was dictated by a sheer desire to create more revenue by granting to the subjects land tenure in one form or another. It is not until the latter half of last century that the Colony felt the need to keep for itself the right to resume possession of land in certain chosen locality for essential public develop-ments. This took the form of a covenant in most of the leases granted after 1854, empowering the Crown to resume possession of the land “for the making of roads or any other public works” in consideration of “such satisfaction or compensation as shall be fixed by two Arbitrators”. Social conditions in the early 20th century were very much different from those existing fifty years earlier. The rapid growth of population and the expansion of commercial activities necessitated a better system of administration. In order to meet the increasing demand for land for developmental activities, the Colonial Government enacted the Land Acquisition Ordinance in 1920 conferring upon the Governor a general power to acquire private land for public purposes. The principles under-lying the Ordinance were drawn heavily from the Indian Land Acquisi-tion Act of 1894 and remained the basis of the law of compulsory land acquisition in Singapore even to this date. Amendments to the Ordinance were made from time to time. The Land Acquisition (Assessment of Compensation) Ordinance, 1946, was introduced providing special basis for assessment of compensation for 2 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 land acquisition under emergency powers during the war. Another amendment was made in 1955, providing for acquisition of land for com-prehensive development as new town, and seeking a stabilisation of land prices by stipulating the 22nd day of April 1955 as the material date for assessing the market value of land acquired within the succeeding 5 years. Other amendments of a more permanent nature were incor-porated into the principal Ordinance in its revised version. 1The defects and weaknesses inherent in the old law gradually came to the surface in the light of the challenging events that have so thoroughly reshaped Singapore in the last decade. The nation is now committed to the arduous if not impossible task of meeting the needs of a population that increases at an average rate of 4%. Ambitious and massive pro-jects are embarked upon to create more opportunities of employment and to solve the housing problem upon the success thereof lies the very survival of the State. Times have changed and so must the laws that have become a retarding force. The Benthamite belief that law must must be a determined agent in the creation of new norms and effective social reforms is certainly relevant here. A Bill was introduced in 1964 but not passed until late 1966 owing to constitutional niceties and the careful scrutiny by the Select Committee. This new Act of 1966 repealed the old Ordinance and was brought into operation on 17th June, 1967. It forms the basis of this artic le on the law of compulsory land acquisition in Singapore. II THE SCOPE OF THE STATE’S ACQUIRING POWERS The State’s power to acquire private land is derived from the general authorisation conferred by section 5 of the Act. All that is required to set the acquisition proceedings in motion is the publication of a declara-tion stating that any particu l ar land in any locality is needed (a) for any public purpose; or \n\n(b) by any person, corporation or statutory board, for any work or an undertaking which, in the opinion o f the Minister, is of public benefit or of public utility or in the public interest; or \n\n(c) for any residential, commercial, or industrial purposes. (s.5(l)). It may be observed that section 5 is worded in very much the same way as the corresponding provisions in the Malaysian Land Acquisition Act, 1960, although clauses (a) and (b) have embodied in themselves the spirit of our pre-existing law. \n\nThe Concept of Public Purpose \n\nThe term “public purpose” is not defined under the Act, nor is any limitation made regarding what is “public benefit”, “public utility” or “public interest”. It may be presumed that these are matters left to 1. Laws of Singapore, 1955 (Cap. 248). July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 3SINGAPORE the absolute discretion of the Minister. Provision for school, highway, sewage works, public clinics, community centres, construction o f large scale housing flats for the lower income groups and other Government projects of an utilitarian nature are all familiar instances justifiable on the grounds of public purpose or public utility. The elasticity of the concept is tellingly demonstrated when judicial decisions in India held that the provision of suitable housing accommodation for Government officers was also a public purpose, and that public purpose “includes any object which secures the good of the public by securing the efficiency of those servants of the Crown on whose service public good materially depend”. 2 Consider the situation where the current user of the private land to be acquired is manifestly of a public nature. Supposing the Government intends to put up an office-building in the High Street area for the use of some essential departments. The only available site is a church-owned compound which has throughout the past years served more or less the purposes of a public park and come to be regarded as a show-piece in that busiest part of the city. In such a given situation, what will be the criteria in giving priority to these two competing pur-poses? The test it is submitted, could be very subjective. It is unlikely that a court of law will be prepared to review an exer-cise of the ministerial discretion since it has been stipulated that the declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for the purpose specified therein, i.e., “public purpose” or “public utility” or “public benefit” as the case may be (s. 5(3)). Under the Act, the Minister is not required to name in the declaration the specific purpose for which a particular land is to be taken. When the specific purpose is not disclosed, the question whether it constitutes a “public purpose” can never be subject to judicial review. However, in the light of experience under the old law, the Minister (in fact it is also the Cabinet in every case) will not approve a decision to acquire private land unless he is sufficiently convinced that (a) the purpose contemplated is of a public necessity sufficiently strong to justify overriding the individual’s or a smaller section of the community’s right in the enjoyment of his or their pro-perty; and \n\n(b) the particular property is the only one, or at any rate, the one which can most fairly be taken for the purpose. \n\nAcquisition of Land for Private Developers \n\nUnder the old Ordinance before any land could be acquired for any private company, an enquiry should be held to satisfy the Government that the land was needed for the construction of some work which was likely to prove useful to the public. The company should also come into an agreement with the Government on the terms on which the land should be held by the company and the terms on which the public should be entitled to use the work. As far as it is known, this power has never been invoked in post-war years in favour of any private company. 2. See University of Bombay v. Municipal Commissioner of the City of Bombay ,I.L.R. 16 Bom. 217. 4 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 This might be the result of the out-moded thinking that public develop-ment must always be the sole responsibility of the Government. Another reason could well be the severity of the statutory requirement itself. The procedure is very much simplified now and there is no longer any requirement as to holding of an enquiry and entering into any agreement with the Government. The declared object of this modification is “to ensure that private development considered beneficial to the community is not held up by obstructive owners of small bits of land which are in-capable of development on their own”. 3 It is believed that this is in-tended to pave the way for more participation by the private sector in the general development of the island. Nevertheless, as far as acqui-sition under clause (b) is concerned, it would appear that the Minister will have to be satisfied in one way or another that the purpose for which a particular land is needed by a private corporation is of public benefit or public utility. Clause (c), though taken from the Malaysian Act, is considered radical and has provoked bitter criticisms. It is thought that the clause as it stands may lead to abuse and private property may be acquired by the Government for some favoured individuals in the absence of any public benefit or interest. 4 What is the object of this new proviso? The Minister for Law said, “What we have in mind is the acquisition of land for implementation of urban renewal plans which may at some future date envisage the acquisition of large pieces of encumbered and occupied lands which, though ready for development, cannot be developed by the owners themselves because of various legal and occupational hindrances. The Government may acquire such land and subsequently clear them after which the Government ma y alienate them to private individuals for development in accordance with an overall urban renewal plan. This will only be possible if we have a clause like this. Again, I am thinking of large scale industrialisation in the coming years which may also envisage similar forms of acquisition and subsequent aliena-tion”. 5It would indeed be difficult not to agree with the suggestion 6 that all the circumstances said to have necessitated clause (c) could well be dealt with under clauses (a) and (b). As a matter of fact, as early as 1959, the Government has already started acquiring land under the old Ordinance for the purpose of urban renewal. Subsequently private developers were invited to participate in the development of some designated areas which have already been cleared and reparcelled. 7Again, the old Ordinance was invoked to acquire land for the Jurong Industrial Project and it would appear that nothing could prevent the Government from alienating the land in parcels for development by indus-trialists in accordance with an overall plan. However, it is believed that the insistance on this additional clause might be attributed to the fear on the part of the Government that if it acquires and clears land under clauses (a) and (b) and then alienates it to private developers, even 3.

Koh’s article at p. xi. 7. Minister for Law, Press Statement on 15th June, 1967. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 5SINGAPORE though such subsequent alienations are conditional upon the private developers undertaking to develop the land within a certain period in accordance with an overall plan, it might well be argued that the land has not been acquired for public purposes. Whether this fear is genuine or not is of course a matter of opinion. It is also believed that, as a matter of policy, before the Minister is prepared to exercise his power in favour of a private developer, he may insist upon being satisfied first that the applicant has exhausted all the avenues open to him. It is most probable that rent-controlled property owners, for instance, may come forward and press the Government to invoke the acquiring power on their behalf so as to avoid dealing with their tenants. The fact that in spite of this apparent extention of the acquiring power the Government is still considering the establishment “of a tribunal to fix the amount of compensation to be paid by a landlord to a tenant when the landlord wishes to recover possession of his land for redevelopment” 8 might very well imply that land acquisition under the Act could only be the last resort. There is no denial that the law as it stands may be open to abuse if given an unscrupulous Government. It is submitted that the position will not be rendered any more satisfactory even if clause (c) was com-pletely deleted. As has been pointed out earlier, the concept of “public purpose” is so flexible that there is always ample room for manoeuvers by an irresponsible administration. \n\nPreliminary Investigation before Publication of the Declaration \n\nSection 3 of the Act is a carry-over of the old law authorising the Government to carry out preliminary investigation on any land to as-certain the suitability of the land for a speci fic purpose. A notification stating that land in a certain locality is “likely to be needed” for any purpose specified in section 5 of the Act may be published in the Gazette and thereupon it shall become lawful for any officer authorised by the Minister to enter upon such land to do any acts necessary to ascertain whether the land is suitable for that purpose. The immediate effects of this notification is to bring the land under the provisions of the Land Encroachment Ordinance 9 and warrants will be issuable by Court to remove any unlawful occupants found on the land after the notification. It may be noted that there is no limitation of time within which the Minister is required to make a decision as to whether he will proceed with the acquisition. It may be feared that undue hardship would be caused to the owner should the Government remain inert after the publication of the notification either through administrative inefficiency or, in the event of a rapid rise in the land market, a desire to freeze the market value of the land which it may want to acquire in a future date when funds are available. The safeguard is to be found in the provision of section 33(1) (a) that, in determining the market value of the land, the date of the publicaton of the notification is not to be taken as a material date unless such notification is within six months followed up with a declaration under section 5. It may be observed that in making an acquisition the wishes of the owner of the land are irrelevant under the Act. There is no provision 8. See note 7. 9. S. 20 of State Land Encroachment Ordinance: (Cap. 245). 6 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 for any objection on the part of the owner to the acquisition itself to be made. Section 10 of the Act confines the owner’s objections to measure-ment of the area and the claim for compensation. The Government is not bound to carry out preliminary investigation under section 3 before making a decision to acquire, there being no requirement that a declara-tion under section 5 should be preceded by a notification under section 3. The old Ordinance 10 from which most of the provisions inclusive of section 3 of the new Act are taken, owes its origin to the Indian Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The Indian Act has since been modified to the effect that no land should be declared to be needed for public purpose unless time has been allowed after the publication of a notification for persons interested in the land to put in objections and for such objections to be considered by the Government. 11 The objections likely to be raised are that the purpose for which the land is to be acquired is not a bona fide public purpose or that the particular land notified is not the best adapted to the purpose intended or that its area is greater than that actually required for the purpose. The position in England is not dis-similar. Where land is to be acquired under general empowering Acts, there is avenue for objections to be heard in public enquiry conducted much as proceedings in an open Court. Theoretically, much could be said for adopting a similar procedure in our law, the most important being the principle of natural justice that one must be heard before something is compulsorily taken from him. However, a closer look at the elaborate procedure in the Indian and the English law will reveal that in the final analysis, the decision to acquire land is nonetheless a matter of ministerial discretion. In both instances, it is the Minister who considers the report of the enquiry and makes the decision which is not subject to appeal. Sections 3 and 5 of our new Act do not in fact preclude the Minister from hearing objections in one manner or another if he so desires. The fact is that ours is such a compact society that it is by no means difficult for the Government to collect the information necessary for the making of a decision on land acquisition. In practice, the power to carry out preliminary investigation was seldom invoked when it was part of the old Ordinance. Presumably it is to be invoked only when gazetting under section 5 is likely to be delayed for one reason or another and it is desirable in the meantime to bring the land under the State Land Encroachment Ordinance so as to keep the land free from possible squatting. \n\nWhat can be acquired as land \n\nIt is to be noted that what has to be acquired in every case under section 5 is the aggregate of all rights in the land and it is not open to the Government to acquire merely some subsidiary rights such as that of a tenant. Section 5 speaks of acquisition of “land” and ‘land’ is de-fined under the Act as including “benefits to arise out of land and things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth” (s. 2). Again, when possession is taken by the Collector, the land shall be vested in the State “free from encumbrances” (s. 18). 10. Laws of Singapore, 1955 (Cap. 248). 11. Land Acquisition Act, 1923 (No. 38 of 1923). July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 7SINGAPORE It may be of interest to consider here whether the Government may acquire an easement without acquiring the land, when the easement might be sufficient for carrying out the specified purpose. In Pinchin v. London and Blackwell 12 it has been observed that “The legislature did not mean, that if I have a field free from a right of way, I shall be bound upon any compensation to substitute for that a field subject to a right of way; if it is taken from me, it must be taken in solido.” This interpretation of the English Land Clauses Act. 1854, was quoted with approval by Lord Watten in Great Western Railway v. Swindon 13 when His Lordship held that the content of the general Act forbade the application of section 18 to lands which were not corporeal hereditaments. Power to acquire in-corporeal hereditaments must be found in a special Act. 14 Since our Act, like the English Land Clauses Act, 1854, speaks of acquisition of land generally without any provision as to acquisition of an easement, it would appear that it is not open to the Government to acquire under the Act an easement without acquiring the land at the same time. If it is only intended to occupy temporarily a particular piece of land for some public purpose, the appropriate procedure to be followed is that spelt out under Part VI of the Act. The Government may occupy any land for a maximum period of three years (s. 42 (1)). Compensation must be paid not only for the occupation but also for any damage that may be d one to land. The owner has a right of appeal on the quantum of compensation to the Appeals Board (s. 42(3)). The Government may be compelled to acquire the land if the land has become permanently unfit for the purpose for which it was used immediately before the occupation \n\nand if the person interested shall so require (s. 43(3)). \n\nPower to Acquire Additional Land \n\nIn accordance with section 50 of the Act, the Government may at any time before the Collector has made his award order the acquisition of the whole or any additional portion of the land of which the land first sought to be acquired forms a part. No fresh declaration shall be neces-sary, though an order must be served upon the person interested. This additional power is comparable to the American concept of “excess con-demnation” or “marginal land acquisition”. The primary object is to avoid paying severance damage which may be so h eavy as to make it more economical to acquire the entirety of the land. It is also intended to prevent the creation of small, uneconomic remnants of private land and to provide land for future development at reasonable costs. \n\nGovernment not bound to complete acquisition \n\nWith the exception of acquisition of land which has been temporarily occupied by the Government by virtue of the provisions under Part VI, the Government is not bound to complete acquisition proceedings unless possession of the land has been taken (s. 48(1)). Upon withdrawal of the acquisition proceedings, the Government must compensate the person interested for any damage done to his land and all such costs as shall have been reasonably incurred by him by reason of the acquisition pro-12. (1854) I. K. &J. 34. 13. (1884) 9 App. Cas. 787. 14. Hill v. Midland Ry. (1882) 21 Ch. D. 143. 8 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 ceeding, together with any damage he may have sustained by reason of such proceedings (s.48(2)). This provision is obviously intended to enable the Government to withdraw from the acquisition proceedings in some exceptional circumstances, e.g. where the public project for which the land is being acquired may have to be abandoned for some unfor-seeable reasons; or, where a more suitable site can be obtained on more reasonable terms. However, in view of the fact that the interests of the owner may be greatly jeopardised and also that public money may be wasted by reason of the payment of compensation the Government will always have to think twice before deciding to withdraw. It is under-stood that very rarely has this provision been invoked in the past years. In a recent case the proceedings were dropped because part of the land gazetted for acquisition happened to come under the building complex of a manufacturing centre which had obtained approval for development. 15 III THE ACQUISITION PROCEDURE BEFORE THE COLLECTOR \n\nThe Collector as an Acquiring Officer \n\nIt would appear from the Act that for all practical purposes the Collector is the proper acquiring officer. It may therefore be useful to consider his position first. The Collector can act only when directed by the Minister under section 6. In the past the Minister’s power in this connection was delegated to the Commissioner of Lands. 16 The Collector as defined by the Act is “any officer appointed by the President to be a Collector of Land Revenue or Deputy Collector of Land Revenue” (s. 2). There is no requirement that he must possess adequate training and experience in valuation. The Collector is primarily concerned with the holding of enquries to look into claims made by persons interested and to make awards for compensation (s. 10). Although he is given some powers of a quasi-judicial nature under the Act, he is by no means a judicial officer. Although he has powers as to enforcement of attendance of witnesses and production of documents for the purposes of the enquiry (s. 14), there is no requirement that the proceedings before him should be governed by any code of civil procedure. He has no power to administer oaths either. It follows that no one can be held liable for perjury by tendering false information in the course of the enquiry. The only deterrent against this is the Collector’s practice of referring to the court or the Appeals Board everything that has been said in the enquiry in the event of a reference or an appeal. Although the Collector must value the land in accordance with the principles of compensation stipulated under the Act (s. 15), he is in fact not required to base his valuation upon the materials produced before him as evidence. As such, he is at liberty to rely upon information which is not disclosed in the enquiry. \n\nThe Nature of the Collector’s Award \n\nThe position of the Collector being such, the award made by him can be anything but a final order as to t h e true value of the land acquired. 15. The proposed acquisition of land at Henderson Road and Tiong Bahru. Vide     \n\n> G.N. 3518, Gazette No. 100 of 1st December, 1967. 16. Vide G.N. 532, Gazette No. 26 of 25th March, 1960. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 9SINGAPORE\n\nNor is the award per se evidence of the market value without considering all the evidence on which it was based. 17 In this connection their Lord-ships of the Judicial Committee observed that “the proceedings resulting in the award are administrative and not judicial; that the award in which the enquiry results is merely a decision (binding only on the Collector) as to the sum that shall be tendered to the owner of the land; and that if a judicial ascertainment of value is desired by the owner he can obtain it by requiring the matter to be referred by the Collector to the Court”. 18 The award is to be conclusive evidence of the area and value of the land only if accepted by the owner (s. 11(1)). It is rather doubtful if any contractual relationship will be created thereby. Specific performance is out of question in view of the Government’s power to withdraw the acquisition before taking possession and at any rate it is not available in proceedings against the Government. 19 An instance was quoted to the Select Committee where the Collector made an ex gratia payment after the award has been made. 20 Recently, an appeal to the Appeals Board was settled “out of Board” by way of an ex gratia payment to the appellants. In announcing the settlement, the Commisioner of Appeals, Buttrose J., remarked that “I accept that this settlement is made purely as an ex gratia matter, no question of principle is involved in the making of it, and is made entirely and inde-pendently of the merits or demerits of the particular acquisition”. 21 It is not known what is or should be the legal standing for this ex gratia payment, the Act making no provision for it. Again is the Collector competent to reopen his award which has been filed by making an ex gratia payment or a supplementary award? It would appear that so long as it does not prejudice the right of any person interested the regularity of an ex gratia payment or a supplementary award will not be called in question. \n\nNotices under section 8 \n\nThe first thing a Collectior is required to do after being directed to act is to serve what may be conveniently called “public” and “specific” notices under section 8. The “public notice” is to be served at some conspicuous places on the land notifying the intended acquisition and the right to make claims. The “s pecific notices” are to be served on the persons known or believed to be interested in the land. These notices are important in view of the fact that an acquisition under the Act covers all the rights or interests in the land to be acquired. Time is therefore needed for the Collector to trace all the reports or informa-tion available to him in order to ascertain the persons interested. This may account for the absence of any time limit for such notices to be served. Under section 9 the Collector is given power to require from any person interested the names of any other persons that may possess any interest in the land. 17. In the matter of Karim Tar Mohamed I.L.R. 33 Bom. 325. 18. Ezra v Secretary of State 32 Cal. 605 (P.C.). 19. Government Proceedings Ordinance, 1956, s. 27(1). 20. At p. C12 of the Select Committee’s Report. 21. Indo-Australian Trading Co. v. Collector of Land Revenue A.B. No. 5 of 1967. 10 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 What would then be the position of a person interested who is not served with a “specific notice”. Most probably if he presents himself to the Collector before the making of the award, the Collector will have to serve a notice on him and take into account his claims. His position would be more complicated if his knowledge of the acquisition came after the award has been made. If his claim does not prejudice the rights of other claimants, the Collector could rectify the position by making asu p plementary award. Failing this, there is no reason why a separate suit could not be maintained against the Collector. However, the suit, if maintainable, can only be for the payment of the compensation to which the claimant is entitled and will definitely not result in the award being set aside or the proceedings declared null and void (s. 53). Section 8 requires a minimum period of 21 days to lapse between the service of notices and the holding of enquiry. However, the Act is silent as to the maximum period within which the Collector must conduct his enquiry. By analogy, there is no time limit within which a person interested must put forward his claim. Can a claim made after the enquiry has been completed be entertained ? Judicial decision in India would seem to consider it a duty of the Collector to admit claims or supplementary claims made at any time before the making of the award and claims so made are proper. 22 As far as it is known, the Collector has always adopted a liberal and practical approach to this question of time for making claims, his primary object being to examine the claims as far as is possible and to slash down litigations. \n\nThe Rule as to Limit of Compensation \n\nIt may be convenient at this point to consider the provisions of section 35. It stipulates that if the owner has made a claim pursuant to the notice under section 8 the amount awarded by the Appeals Board shall not exceed the amount so claimed or be less than the amount awarded by the Collector. If the owner has not made the claim without sufficient reasons to be allowed by the Board, then the amount awarded by the Board shall not exceed the amount awarded by the Collector. This is another rule carried over from the repealed Ordinance. Similar pro-visions exist in the Indian as well as the Malayan law, except that in the latter the Court may award less than the Collector’s award even if a claim has been made. 23 It is believed that this provision was originally intended to put the claimants on the alert and to deter them from lying idle and then putting forth artificially inflated claims after the award has been made. The claimants would thus be held to their own bargains and prevented from increasing their claims at every stage from the Collector to the Board. It is also thought that this would have the effect of enabl-ing the Collector to make a reasonable award with the view to being accepted by the owners and minimising litigation. To what extent, if at all, has the rule achieved the intended objec-tives since it was introduced by our pre-existing ordinance? In fact it has been pointed out as early as 1955 that “if the dispossessed owner has sufficient acumen, he may gamble upon the award being increased by the 22. See Secretary of State v. Sohan Lal , 44 Ind Cas. 883. 23. Rule 4 in the first schedule of the Malayan Land Acquisition Act, 1960. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 11 SINGAPORE Court and if he does not base his claim upon a too outrageously high figure he runs apparently little risk of having to meet the cost of the claim”. 24 It is interesting to note that most of the references under the old Ordinance have in the past resulted in awards lying somewhere between the Collector’s awards and the owner’s claims. This means the owners will always get something more than what has been awarded by the Collector. The logical consequence is that the Collector will be in-duced to make a lower award while the owners will ask for more. The combined effect of sections 10 and 35 is thus nothing more than an open invitation to litigation. The rule would appear all the more undesirable as it would have the effect of penalising the poor and the ignorant who are most likely to fail to respond to such notices. 25 If an owner ‘sleeps upon his rights’ without even making an appearance at the enquiry, his appeal against the award will be as good as lost. So will be the fate of those humble small-holders who appear before the Collector and say, “I leave it to the Government to give a fair price”. The big owners having all the experienced valuers and law yers at their service therefore will stand to gain while the poor and the ignorant will have to suffer. \n\nReference to Court by the Collector \n\nAt any time before making his award the Collector may refer for determination by the Court of such matters as apportionment and con-struction of instruments (s. 10 (2)). The same provision existed under the old Ordinance except that now the Collector may also refer the question as to cost of enquiry. It is not clear whether this implies that costs will be chargeable for the enquiry under section 10. It is believed that this provision, like clause (c) of section 5(1), is another transplantation from the Malaysian Act. In the case of the Malaysian Act, there is a clear-cut provision for costs to be charged for the Collector’s enquiry (s. 14 (5)). Nevertheless, the propriety of charging cost for the Collector’s enquiry might very well be questioned since the enquiry is nothing more than part of the administrative function of a Government officer. The sug-gestion that any part y to the proceedings should have the same right to make the reference 26 does not seem to advocate the needful. It is believed that an extension of the right to the parties will only result in the acquisition proceedings being delayed through frivolous applications. In any event, the Collector’s award is in no way an adjudication of the claimant’s rights inter se. The apportionment he makes is based upon the best of his judgment on the materials produced before him. If the disputants are not satisfied with his judgment, and the Collector does not deem it necessary to make a reference under section 10(2), they can always have their respective ri ghts determined by appealing to the Appeals Board in accordance wit h sections 23 and 38. \n\nThe Question of Time Limits \n\nThe absence of time limits for the various stages leading to the 24. J.F.N. Murray, A Report on Control of Land Prices, Valuation and Compulsory Acquisition of Land at p. 43. 25. T.T.B. Koh’s article, at p. xviii. 26. At p. B34 of the Select Committee’s Report. 12 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 making of the award has been much complained of. 27 Suggestions were made to the Select Committee to lay down in the Act certain time limits compelling the Collector to act as soon as possible. 28 It has to be conceded that the omission might well turn out to be a legal sanction for a bureaucratic executive to indulge in delaying tactics with total dis-regard for the interests of the land owners. Nevertheless, it is felt that the very nature of the procedure before the Collector is such that it can hardly admit of rigid limitations as to time without defeating the very purposes of the proceedings. As it has been noted earlier notices under section 8 are so important that ample time must be allowed for the Collector to trace all the persons interested. It is also in the in-terest of the persons interested that they should be given time to for-mulate their claims with the aid of valuers. Indeed, it should always be the duty of the Collector as well as the desire of the owner to try to reach an award that is mutually acceptable. Enquiries therefore tend to be protracted and time-consuming. At times the Collector will have to adjourn the enquiry either at the request of the owner or for himself to refer fresh information to the Government valuer for advice. The proceedings can become very tedious when a single declaration in-volves a great number of lots coming under different ownership. The Collector will be expected to conduct more enquiries and make more than one award. It is therefore believed that imposition of time limits in proceedings of this kind can only bring about harsh awards to be followed by litigation. As a matter of fact, complaints about possible delays do not come from the landowners alone. A report in 1955 has this to say: “the procedure under the Land Acquisition Ordinance is unnecessarily complicated and leads not only to delays and frustrations but also as a result, in many instances to amounts of compensation grossly in excess of the sums they may justl y be entitled to receive being paid to dis-possessed owners of land”. 29 Regrettably the old procedure as regards the making of awards was re-enacted apparently without any effort to simplify or streamline it. It may be observed that as the law stands now a landowner may, if he chooses to, delay proceedings in various ways. One of this would be to insist upon section 7 being complied with, i.e., to require the Collector to mark out the land and to cause survey and plan to be made. In order to save time the Collector always gives the scaled area only, leaving survey to be done after the acquisition proceeding has been completed. On the other hand, if he is guilty of unjustifiable delay amounting to a refusal to make the award, the prerogative order of mandamus would lie against him because “he is acting under a statutory power which imposes upon him a duty to the public”. 30 \n\nTaking Possession \n\nAs soon as an award has been made, the Collector may take posses-sion of the land by posting thereupon an appropriate notice (s. 16(1)). 27. T.T.B. Koh’s article, at p. xii. 28. At p. B27 of the Select Committee’s Report. 29. See note 20. 30. Bukit Sembawang Rubber Co ., Ltd. v. Collector of Land Revenue, (1961) 27 M.L.J. 269. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 13 SINGAPORE Before taking possession he must make payment of the compensation to the persons interested or deposit it with the High Court in case of a dis-pute as to apportionment or any other contingencies (s. 40(1)). Failing this he will have to pay interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time of taking possession until the amount of compensation has been paid or deposited (s. 41). In cases of urgency, the Collector with the prior approval of the Minister may take possession of land on the expiration of seven days from service of notices under section 8 (s. 17(1)). The Collector may also be directed to take possession of land before the publication of a declaration, provided that such declaration is published not later than seven days after he has taken possession. As far as it is known, in-stances where this emergency power was resorted to were rare. There must certainly exist some overwhelming public necessity of an urgent nature to warrant this deviation from the normal procedure. An in-stance where this provision was invoked was the acquisition of the Bukit Ho Swee fire site a few years back. It was thought desirable to take immediate possession because of the need for speedy clearance. IV PRINCIPLES OF COMPENSATION \n\nPersons entitled to Compensation \n\nThe Act provides in general terms for compensation to be made to all persons who are known, or believed, to be interested in the land acquired. Section 2 defines “persons interested” as including “every person claiming an interest in compensation to be made on account of the acquisition of land under this Act, but does not include a tenant by the month or at will”. Literally, it would thus appear to include any person claiming an interest in the compensation to be made so long as he is not a tenant by the month or at will, whether the claim be valid or not. The Collector’s duty under the Act is to assess and offer com-pensation for the land as a whole and then distribute the amount so assessed among the various claimants. In case of disputes as to the interest of the various claimants, he will have to refer the point in dispute for determination by the Court or leave it to the claimants to appeal to the Appeals Board. The only persons whose claims can be ignored by the Collector are persons who are tenants by the month or at will. It is under-stood that the Collector’s practice has been to exclude any claims made by a tenant not holding a lease-hold interest irrespective of whether or not he enjoys statutory protection under the Control of Rent Ordi-nance. 31 It was thought that the words “tenant by the month” must be given their plain connotation and so construed, they include a monthly tenant of rent-controlled premises. The fact that the monthly tenant of rent-controlled premises cannot be deprived of possession of his premises except on the grounds specified in the Rent Control Ordinance does not in any way make him any less a monthly tenant. Being trespassers upon 31. Laws of Singapore, 1955 (Cap. 242). 14 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 the land, the squatters are not in any better position than the rent-controlled tenants by the month. However, the Collector has adopted the practice of making small amount of ex-gratia payments to them as removal or disturbance allowances. \n\nThe Concept of Market Value \n\nThe main principles of compensation applicable in Singapore are spelt out in a condensed form under sections 33 and 34 of the new Act. The concept of market value remains as in the past the basis for the measurement of compensation. It may also be noted that the same concept is widely adopted in India, Australia, Malaysia and some other countries. About 50 years ago, in the absence of general legislation providing for the law of compensation, judicial decisions in England postulated and upheld the principle that the value of the land acquired was to be taken as its value to the owner. However, later legislation changed this by adopting market value as a measure of compensation. 32 When assessing the amount of compensation, the Appeals Board as well as the Collector are required to take into consideration the market value of the land at the date of the publication of the Declaration under section 5. Some consider it unfair to the landowner to have picked the date of the publication of the Declaration as the material date es pecially when proceedings are protracted and land value escalating rapidly. 33 The sentiment of an owner placed in such position is no doubt real and understandable. But his sense of gratitude for the rule can be as real and legitimate if the land market happens to operate in an opposite direction. What is market value? It is left undefined as is also the case in places where the law makes “market value” the basis for the measurement of compensation. At least in India it was thought that the matter should be left for the decision primarily of the Collector and ultimately of the Court. 34 It would however appear proper to translate the concept into the rule of “willing seller and willing buyer”. As approved by judicial decisions in America, it means “the price which it will bring when it is offered for sale by one who desires, but is not obliged to sell, and is bought by one who is under no necessity of having it.” 35 A “willing seller” does not mean a person willing to sell without reserve for any price that he can obtain, but one who is willing to sell making the most, in the circumstances, of his property. 35a A willing or potential pur-chaser is a man who proposes to tie up a certain amount of capital in the land and the price he will be prepared to pay at a given time will be influenced largely by the rule of supply and demand. 35b In simple terms, the elements of sentiment, urgent need or compulsion should not come into play. It is therefore essential that in arriving at the true 32. S. 2(2) of the Acquisition of Land (Compensation) Act, 1919. 33. T.T.B. Koh’s article, at p. xv. 34. A. Ghosh, Laws of Compulsory Acquisition and Compensation (5th ed.), p. 218. 35. Lewis on Eminent Domain (2nd ed.), s. 478. 35a. Gripps, Compulsory Acquisition of Land, (llth ed.), p. 887. 35b. David M. Lawrance, W. H. Rees and W. Britton, Modern Methods of Valuation of Land, Houses arid Buildings, (5th ed.), p. 2. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 15 SINGAPORE market value of the land, the degree of urgency which has to part with the land should be disregarded, (s. 34 (a) & (b)). For the purposes of arriving at the market value, the appraisal experts or the courts will always look for evidence of bona fide transac-tions in the land acquired at a reasonable date. In a recent appeal to the Appeals Board, Choor Singh J. observed that “in ascertaining the market value of a piece of land at a particular date the first matter to be considered is whether there is evidence of previous sales of the same property in the open market within a reasonable time”. 36 However, the question likely to arise is the weight to be given to such evidence. It would appear to be well-established that there is no reason why the amount of compensation cannot be less or more than the price previously paid by the owner, so long as it truly reflects the market value at the material date. Some judicial decisions seemed to have thought other-wise. It was once held that “it is never a correct procedure to compen-sate persons whose lands have been compulsorily acquired, by offering them substantially less than what they have paid for the land . . . . The applicant (landowner) may have paid more than what was worth to a cautious purchaser but, even so, the principle remains the same . . . . Different considerations might apply in any case it could be shown that a purchaser speculated in the purchase of the land on the chance that it would be acquired by the Government”. 37 In the absence of evidence of previous sales of the subject land, one must turn to the prices at which lands in the vicinity have been sold, making all due allowance . for differences in the conditions of the land. More refined methods will have to be resorted to when evidence in the first two instances is not available. \n\nFactors Qualifying the Concept of Market Value \n\n(1) The ‘Seven-Year Rule’ \n\nThe new enactment introduces important factors qualifying the rule of market value. The most important of this is what may be called the “seven-year rule”. Any increment of value in the land acquired by reason of public developments in the neighbourhood within seven years preceding the date of the Declaration is to be ignored (s.33(2) (c)). The principle underlying this rule is that no one should stand to benefit from a rise in the land market through no efforts of his own. The inequity will become more evident an d unbearable when the gain is to be at the expense of the public coffer. Obviously the rule is resultant from the State’s bitter experience in having had to pay higher costs for acquisition in consequence of its earlier acquisitions and development of the neighbouring lands. The development in the Jurong industrial area and the consequential rise in prices in that area could be the most glaring example calling for an answer to the problem of betterment. Critics of the new legislation do not seem to dispute the soundness and the equitable basis of the rule. The criticism is whether the seven-year rule as it stands now is feasible and whether it will achieve the 36. Nasir Mallal v. Collector of Land Revenue, A.B. 4 of 1967. 37. Er Boon Yan v. The Collector of Land Revenue, Port Dickson, (1955) 21 M.L.J. 133. 16 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 objectives desired. It has been suggested that since land prices could be changed by a combination of causes, it would be difficult to ascertain the extent to which the increase is attributable to betterment in the neighbouring lands. 38 Another difficulty or ambiguity in the rule is the time when the rule begins to run. 39 These are no doubt difficult pro-blems posed by the rule. It is however not impossible that in time to come, valuation experts and the courts may agree upon some criteria qualifying the working of the rule. It is not unlikely that the rule is intended to be flexible so as to give room for special conditions when its rigid adherence is likely to produce discriminatory effects. It is sub-mitted that the complications in the rule are over-emphasized by the misconception that the measurement of market value is a matter of mathematical or scientific precision. Like the development charge, the rule is only a partial treatment of the difficult problem of betterment in the absence of comprehensive legislation. (2) Taxed Value as the Upper-limit of Market Value \n\nAnother qualifying factor is where, within two years preceding the date of the Declaration the value of the land has been stated and accepted for the purposes of assessing any tax or duty payable thereon, the market value of such land at the date of such statement shall be deemed not to exceed the value contained therein (s. 33(2) ( d ) ) . Presumably, the rule is intended as a deterrent against evasion of tax or duty by property owners. It would produce the effect of a supplementary device aimed at securing revenue for the Government. It may be noted that when the Land Compensation Act, 1911, reversed the basis of compensation in England by embodying the concept of market value, a special proviso was inserted stating that “the arbitrator shall be entitled to consider all returns and assessments of capital value for taxation made or acquiesced in by the claimants”. In actual fact, it has been a common practice for the local valuers to take taxed value into consideration when assessing the market value of the land acquired at a certain date. The new rule goes a step further by stipulating that the market value at the date when the taxed value is stated should not exceed such taxed value. An upper-limit of the market value of land at a certain day within two years preceding the Declaration is therefore fixed. As to the suggestion that an innocent buyer within that two years may be discriminated against if the taxed value is understated by the previous owner, 40 it is arguable if the misgivings of such ‘innocent buyer’ deserve consideration. The fact is that low assessment for purposes of taxation is always a material consideration inducing a purchaser to take the property. A prudent purchaser can indeed be reasonably expected to understand the implica-tions of an understated taxed value, and if he is not honest enough to get it rectified upon his purchasing the property, he can only have himself to blame when the property comes to be acquired later. (3) Planning Restrictions \n\nAnother controversial element brought about by the new Act is the requirement to take into consideration the planning restrictions on the 38. At p. B19 of the Select Committee’s Report. 39. T.T.B. Koh’s article, at p. xiv. 40. Ibid. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 17 SINGAPORE land acquired (s. 33(2) (e)). It is a well-established principle that the potential value of the land acquired must be taken into account when measuring the market value of land. The presumption must always be that the man makes the best use of his property. All future possibilities on which a prudent purchaser would calculate and a vendor would place his expectations must have a bearing on the market value. The prin-ciple has been fully accepted in England. “Tribunal assessing compen-sation may take into account not only the present purpose of which the land is applied but also all other beneficial purposes to which in the course of events it might within a reasonable period be applied, just as an owner might have if he was bargaining with the purchaser in the market. The principle is applicable whether the owner has acquired the land in order to use it for some particular purpose or whether he has no such present intention”. 41 The same principle is also recognised in India for purposes of assessment of compensation under the Indian Land Acquisi-tion Act, 1894. It was held that “the potential value . . . . are the elements that necessarily come in, when applying ‘the current price of similar land in the neighbourhood’ that is, what other people had paid for similar land when thrown in the market. The buyer would look ahead and calculate on the reasonable possibilities of the land to yield a better income by proper utilization according to its suitability or special adaptability according to prevailing demands, or by suitable development”. 42 It has also been said in a Malayan case that “the Collector is wrong in valuing land solely upon the value of the rubber on the land and not upon the land itself and he should have taken into account all the potentialities of the land for other purposes”. 43 What will be the impact of this new rule on the concept of potential value? Fear has been expressed that the rule might be used to exclude the developmental potential of the land based upon the prospects of a chan ge in the restrictions of the Planning Ordinance applicable to the land. 44 It remains to be seen whether such an interpretation can stand up under the scrutiny of either the valuation experts or judicial review. It is a well-known fact that planning restriction has all along been an important consideration in assessing the value of land which has been compulsorily acquired. This does not necessarily mean that considera-tion is not given to other possibilities of the user of the land. In a recent appeal to the Appeals Board involving an acquisition taking place under the old Ordinance, in increasing the amount of compensation for a plot of land zoned for agricultural purpose the Commissioner, Choor Singh J. said that the Government valuer “has valued the land as purely agri-cultural land and has failed to consider its potential use for holiday bungalows”. 45 Although the law applicable in this particular case is the old Ordinance it is however believed that there is no difficulty for the Appeals Board to interpret the new rule, if it chooses to, in such a way as not to disregard altogether the other potential value of the land. It is submitted that the doctrine of potential value must be accepted with 41. Halsbury, Laws of England, (2nd Ed.), Vol. 6 p. 45. 42. Prem Chand Burral v. Collector of Calcutta I.L.R. 2 Cal. 103. 43. Er Boon Yan v. Collector of Land Revenue, Port Dickson, (1955) 21 M.L.J. 133. 44. T.T.B. Koh’s article, at p. xiv. 45. Nasir Mallal v. Collector of Land Revenue, A.B. 4 of 1967. 18 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 certain limitations. Experience has shown that this doctrine always leads to fantastic claims founded on pure imagination or possibilities which are so remote and speculative. It is not unlikely that the rule is intended as a limitation to the wider principle of potential value, though not necessarily a denial of the very concept itself. (4) Value increased by private development and illegal user of land \n\nThe other two qualifying factors are self-evident. One of these is that the increase in the value of the land to be acquired consequent upon some improvement made within 2 years preceding the declaration shall be disregarded unless two conditions are satisfied (s.33(2)(a)). First, the improvement must have been made by the owner or his predecessor in interest. Secondly, the improvement must have been made bona fide \n\nand not in contemplation of the acquisition. Increase in value due to the user of the land in a manner con-trary to law or detrimental to public health is also to be disregarded (s. 33(2) (b)). The simple example will be where the land acquired is zoned for agricultural purpose, but the owner has erected thereupon some permanent structures without any planning approval. The value of these structures will not be taken into account when assessing compensation for the land. \n\nMatters relevant to the Assessment of Compensation \n\n(1) Increase in the value of other land to be set- off \n\nThe Act also lays down some matters which are to be taken into account when assessing the amount of compensation. One of these is “any increase in the value of the other land of the person interested likely to accrue from the use to which the land acquired will be put” (s. 33(1) (b)). This is another matter related to the difficult problem of betterment and makes our position very much like that in the United States where “some devices have fused the betterment and compensation activities into a single approach”. 46 The principle of “off-set of benefits” is generally accepted in the United States. The Indian Act of 1894, however, expressly provides for this matter to be ignored 47 so as to prevent, presumably, owners’ claims for injurious affection provided for by the Act from being set-off on account of a prospective increase in the value of other land. In the early law of compensation in England, it was thought that “such increased value could not be set-off against the damage for severance or injurious affections to which the claimant was entitled”. 48 The Land Compensation Act, 1961, embodies the principle by providing generally for the set-off of betterment of land retained by the owner part of whose land has been acquired. 49 Needless to say, the rule of prospective increase presupposes a unity of title in the land acquired and the other land whose value is increased. It would appear from the wording of our provision that the two pieces of land need not be contiguous or adjoining so long as increase in the 46. David R. Levin, Aspects of Eminent Domain in the United States , (Law and Land ).            \n\n> 47. S. 24 (b) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. 48. Eagle v. Charing Cross Mail Co. (1867) L.R. 2 C.P. 638. 49. S. 7 of the Land Acquisition (Compensation) Act, 1961. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 19 SINGAPORE\n\nvalue of the other land can reasonably be attributed to the development of the land acquired. The rule has been criticized as being ambiguous in that it does not specif y whether the whole or only a part of the in-crease will be deducted. 50 In fact, the rule is clear-cut on this as what is to be deducted is the increase “likely to accrue from the use to which the land acquired is to be put”. As in the seven-year rule, the com-plication is to what extent is the increase attributable to the user to which the land acquired is to be put. This again is a matter of fact and can only be ascertained after taking into account all the relevant factors contributory to the increase. It is submitted that gross injustice may be done if that “other land” comes to be acquired at a later stage. Will the seven-year rule be applied again to set-off from its market value that increase which has already been taken from the owner in the previous acquisition of his land? The English law makes provisions ensuring that any increase in value which has been set-off in previous acquisition should be taken into account and paid for on a subsequent acquisition. 51 In the absence of a similar provision in our law it is submitted that equitable prin-ciples should be adhered to. (2) Damage for Severance \n\nIt is only equitable that damage for severance should be compensated for. The principle is fully accepted in our law (s. 33(1) (c)). Whether there is something in the nature of a severance causing damage to the other land of the owner is of necessity a question of fact in each case. The position in English law seems to have been well settled. “In order to make the claim for severance it is not necessary for the remaining land to be contiguous to the land acquired or held under the same title. It is enough if both parcels of land are held by the same owner and if the unity of ownership conduces to the advantage or protection of the property as one holding”. 52 The bare fact that before the exercise of the compulsory power the claimant was common owner of both parcels is insufficient. The criteria is that the land taken must be so connected or related to the remaining part that by reason of severance the owner is prejudiced in his ability to use or dispose of the remaining land to advantage. The extent to which damage by severance is compensable is therefore the diminution in the value of the remaining land. In other words, this can be the loss of potential value of the remaining land for development. As has been pointed out earlier, the Government has power to acquire additional land which is part of the land first sought to be acquired. This has in practice rendered the important concept of severance of very little significance. (3) Injurious Affection \n\nThe rule of injurious affection as formulated by the new Act con-templates injuries in any other manner and includes also injury to movable property and the loss of earnings (s. 33(1) ( d ) ) . The concept 50. T.T.B. Koh’s article, at p. xv. 51. S. 8 of Land Acquisition (Compensation) Act, 1961. 52. R.D. Stewart-Brown, Encyclopedia of Compulsory Purchase and Compensation,    \n\n> p. 1055. 20 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1\n\nis not based upon any tortious liabilities. Compensation may be claimed notwithstanding that the damage would not have been actionable even if not done in pursuance of statutory power. In simple terms, injurious affection really means a depreciation in value. It has been suggested that the rule as it stands now will not cover dama ge likely to result from the user to which the land acquired will be put. 53 It is submitted that this is not true in view of some judicial decisions elsewhere. In an English case involving an acquisition of part of land for the construc-tion of sewage works, evidence was given that the existence of that works even if conducted so as not to create an actionable nuisance would depreciate the market value of the owner’s other land for building purposes. The House of Lords held that compensation might be awarded for damage for injurious affection not only by the construction of the sewage works but by their use. 54 The principle was later held to be applicable to cases in India, as “otherwise it would be difficult to see to what classes of cases section 33, clause 4, can properly apply”. 55 Section 33 clause 4 of the Indian Act is worded exactly the same way as our section 33(l)(d). Some familiar instances of claims by way of in-jurious affections are loss of frontage when the front portion of the land is taken or loss of easements generally. The English law also allows claims for loss of privacy and loss of amenities. 56 It has been doubted whether compensation for injurious affection will cover loss of good-will. 57 There is no reason why the expression “loss of earnings” in section 33(l)(d) cannot be taken to include loss of earnings from a business which was a growing concern before the acquisition. It is therefore sub-mitted that loss of goodwill can certainly be compensated under the rule if it reduces the claimants’ earnings. A claim for loss of goodwill can only be ignored when the goodwill is a personal one or the business does not depend for its success on the use of the particular site. (4) Reasonable Expenses Incidental to Change of Premises \n\nReasonable expenses incidental to change of residence or place of business by reason of the acquisition must also be compensated (s. 33(1) (e)). Expenses of removal would be the most familiar item to be allowed under this particular provision. It may be noted here that English law allows an exception to the general principle of market value. Compensation may be assessed on the basis of the reasonable cost of equivalent reinstatement provided that reinstatement is bona fide intended and the land acquired is devoted, and but for the acquisition would continue to be devoted, to a purpose of such a nature that there is no general demand or market for land for that purpose. 58 This rule is better known as the principle of reinstatement which means to award the costs of placing the claimant in the same position, or in an equally advantageous position, to that he occupied when he was dispossessed because of the compulsory acquisition. This would include the cost of purchasing an equally convenient site and of rebuilding, or adapting existing buildings thereon. 53. T.T.B. Koh’s article, at p. xvi. 54. Cowper Essex v.

S. 5(5) of the Land Acquisition (Compensation) Act, 1961. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 21 SINGAPORE There is no provision in our law corresponding to this principle of reinstatement. It is however submitted that legally there would appear to be no objections to applying it in some deserving cases. For example, where a landowner is deprived of his employment or a farmer-owner is deprived of his livelihood by reason of the acquisition, there can be strong reasons for applying the principle so that he may be rehabilitated pro-perly. Of course this does not mean that the owner can by right request compensation to be assessed on the basis of this principle. Even in England, the principle is considered discretionary and the discretion will not be exercised in favour of a claimant carrying on a commercial under-taking, where the cost of reinstatement exceeds the value of the under-taking. 59 \n\nMatters Irrelevant to Assessment of Compensation \n\nThe Act specifies some negative factors which are the antithesis of the matters which must be taken into account. The following items are to be disregarded (s. 34) : (a) the degree of urgency which has led to the acquisition; (b) the owner’s disinclination to part with the land acquired; (c) any damage which if caused by a private person would not be actionable; (d) any damage or increase in value to the land acquired in conse-quence of the use to which it will be put; (e) any expenditure on additions or improvements to the land acquired made after the declaration unless this is necessary to maintain any building in a proper state of repair. Items (a) and (b) refer to matters which are not capable of measure-ment in monetary terms, but the Collector as well as the Appeals Board are required not to allow themselves to be influenced by the owner’s sentiment. Item (d) ensures that the owner does not take advantage of the Government’s proposed development for making an exorbitant claim for compensation. Item (e) is repetitive of the principle underlying the rule in section 33(2) (a), and ensures that a landowner does not carry out improvements to the land with a view to enhancing the value and the consequential compensation claim. \n\nFire Site Provisions \n\nThe controversial fire site proviso must now be examined. It was first introduced in 1961 by way of an amendment to the old Ordinance. It refers to acquisition of: (a) any land devastated or affected directly or indirectly by fire or any act of God, or; (b) any land immediately adjoining such devastated or affected land. 59. R.D. Stewart-Brown, op. cit ., at p. 1052. 22 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 The amount of compensation payable should not exceed one-third of the value of such land had it been vacant, not subject to any encumbrances, tenancies, etc., unless the Minister in his discretion specifies otherwise by a notification in the Gazette. (Proviso to s. 33(1)). The intention of the rule, as it has been so often repeated, is to ensure that any appreciation in the value of land consequent upon an act of God clearing all encumbrances thereon should not go to the landowner. The example frequently quoted as giving birth to the proviso is the calamity in Bukit Ho Swee some years back when a fire cleared all the squatters and, but for this proviso, the landowners would have been able to dispose of their land as vacant sites with considerably enhanced value. It may be argued whether an owner so benefitted could properly be said to have been “unjustly enriched” as there can be no ethical objection so long as he does not set fire to his own property. 60 It is however feared that if landowners are to be fed with windfalls, some unscrupulous owners not being able to get rid of whatever encumbrances on their land either because of legal hindrances or their unwillingness to compensate the occupiers, might well be tempted to commit arson. The victims would be none other than the poor squatters or the rent-controlled tenants on the land. The rule is prohibitive against such foul play. The State, being the organised power of the community, is considered more entitled to receive the windfalls in view of the fact that it takes upon itself the duty to look after the general welfare of the victims. To what extent must the calamity ruin the property in order that it could be said to have been “devastated or affected directly or indirectly” ? Assuming the fire has taken place gutting down only a small portion of a godown, could the rule be applied to acquire the whole of the godown with its other subsidiary buildings? The answer would appear to be yes. Could the expression “land immediately adjoining” be taken to cover the entirety of an adjoining land many times bigger than the fire site itself? Again, the rule is capable of being interpreted that way. The rule as it stands is therefore comprehensive and may cover situations very much different from those justifying its existence. It is submitted that the rule should be used sparingly, and interpreted equitably so as not to produce undue financial loss to the owner. Since the rule is intended to capture for the State what may be properly con-sidered “windfalls” its application will never be justifiable where the act of God brings not windfall but irreparable financial loss to the property owner. The owner of a godown could hardly rejoice at an act of God destroying his godown and ruining his business miserably. Apparently, the legislature is aware of the harshness and oppressiveness of the rule if it is to be applied indiscriminately. The fact that the Minister is given a discretion to waive the rule is clear evidence that the rule is not in-tended to be of general application. Unfortunately, the legislature chose to remain silent on the circumstances under which the Minister may exercise his discretion. The well-recognised canon of construction being not to interpret an Act of the legislature in such a way as to take away property without just compensation unless such intention is clearly ex-60. T.T.B. Koh’s article, at p. xvii. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 23 SINGAPORE pressed or implied, the Minister may well be considered to have a duty to exercise his discretion when a given situation is such that the appli-cation of the rule is likely to prove harsh or oppressive. VRIGHT OF AND PROCEDURE FOR APPEALS \n\nPermanent Boards to hear Appeals from Collector’s Awards \n\nFor the purpose of hearing appeals against Collector’s awards the Act provides for one or more Appeals Boards to be set up. Critics of the new legislation saw in this “an incursion into the vested and in-herent right of appeal” and requested that the old procedure in the pre-existing law be retained with “suitable modifications”. 61 Previously, appeals against the Collector’s awards were by way of reference to the High Court. Proceedings in the hearing of appeals were as formal and cumbersome as in an ordinary civil suit. It was felt that such a machinery could only suit the needs of a situation under which the acquisition of land was restricted to the barest minimum. It was however out of the context of a new situation where land acquisition activities must necessarily be intensified to meet the needs of vigorous development. A permanent body is needed to deal with the objections that are increasing as a result of frequency of acquisitions. The pre-valent trend elsewhere is for grievances of this nature to be redressed by administrative tribunals. The legislature saw in this a solution to our problems and hence the establishment of the Appeals Board. The obvious advantages are that the tribunals are less formal, more expeditious and more likely to produce justice speedily. The procedure of the Board is to be “such as the Board may determine”, and it may “admit or reject any evidence adduced, whether admissible or inadmissible under the provisions of any written law for the time being in force relating to the admissibility of evidence” (s. 25(4) (d)). Lest the informality of the new procedure should tend to encourage litigation, some new requirements are made casting upon the appellant the onus of initiating the appeal and proving that the award is inade-quate. Previously all that an intending appellant was required to do was to inform the Collector within the statutory period that he did not accept the award. Thereupon the onus of making the reference and justifying the award devolved upon the Collector. This was thought an unsatisfactory system for making things too easy for the property owners. Any person interested aggrieved by an award shall now lodge notice of appeal with the Board and make or authorise the making of a deposit amounting to one-third of the award or $5,000/-, whichever is the less (s.23(l) (a) & (b)). If the purpose of the deposit is to serve as security for cost alone then the amount is no doubt, as it has been suggested, excessive and prohibitive. 62 It is believed the legislature intended this to be one of the measures aimed 61. At p. B33 of the Select Committee’s Report. 62. At p. B17 of the Select Committee’s Report. 24 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 at discouraging appeals. However, the severity of the requirement is very much neutralised by the possibility of the owner authorising payment of the deposit from the compensation awarded by the Collector. The owner is not required to, to use the Minister’s words, “fork it out in cash”. 63 It is submitted that no valid objections could be maintained against putting upon the appellant the onus of providing the inadequacy of the Collector’s award. As has been pointed out early if a claim has been made pursuant to the notice under section 8, the Board may not reduce the amount awarded by the Collector. The primary concern of the Board will therefore be whether the award should be increased. The owner may reasonably be expected to have in possession facts inducing him to make a higher claim. It is therefore incumbent upon him to make out a prima facie case for raising the award. In this connection, he is facilitated by the requirement that the Collector must submit his grounds of award (s. 23(2)). \n\nComposition of the Boards \n\nThe omission to lay down the qualifications of the Commissioners and to provide for them security of tenure of office has given rise to some apprehension that the persons selected may not be free from in-fluence by the executive. 64 It is believed that the omission is deliberate in order not to limit the Government’s choice of suitable candidates which is considered undesirable. To reassure the public of the Government’s sincerity and to inject into them confidence in the Board, two High Court judges have been appointed to head two Appeals Boards for a period of two years. Presumably for the same reason, members of the panel of assessors need not be “qualified assessors”. As a result of shortage of “qualified assessors” in this part of the world not infrequently some of the assessors did in the past represent landowners in some cases and sat as Court assessors in others. This position was undoubtedly abnormal, though it did not necessarily reflect any doubt on the integrity of the profession as a whole. The present twelveman panel of assessors consist of dis-tinguished citizens from a variety of professions. Only two of them are qualified assessors. Only in cases where the Collector’s award exceeds two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is the Commissioner required to sit with two assessors to be selected by him (s. 26). The principle that the opinions of the assessors do not bind the Commissioner remains unaltered (s. 27(1)). It was thought by some that the existence of a panel of assessors would serve no purpose unless the rule of majority is to prevail. 65 A review of past references would reveal that in a great majority of cases judgments were announced un-animously. It would appear that judges hearing the references were always prepared to be convinced by assessors, and to accept their reason-ing as expert opinions. In the reference relating to acquisition of 78 acres of land for housing development at Toa Payoh, 66 for instance, in announcing an increase of the award C. H. Whitton J. added that “I was 63. At p. C38 of the Select Committe’s Report. 64. At p. B35 of the Select Committe’s Report. 65. At p. B36 of the Select Committe’s Report. 66. Land Acquisition Reference No. 5 of 1954. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 25 SINGAPORE convinced by the views of the assessors . . . . a case had been made out for raising the rate from 15 cents to at least 18 cents”. The extent to which a trial judge could be influenced by the assessor’s opinion was fully illustrated in another reference. Though convinced that on the evidence put before the Court the appellant had completely failed to make out any case for increasing the Collector’s award, Taylor J. agreed with the assessor’s opinion that the award must be increased and said “since valuation is largely a matter for expert opinion, I feel I must defer to the views of the assessors”. 67 Broadly speaking, the function of the assessors is to assist the Board with their professional knowledge and experience in arriving at a fair amount of compensation by giving an objective appraisal and interpre-tation of all the evidence put before the Board. Their service is all the more indispensable in cases involving technical intricacies. As a general rule, they should form their opinions upon the facts produced before the Board. In the reference last quoted, the assessors’ conclusion to raise the award was substantially based upon some valuations of their own which were not disclosed. If this is to be considered normal, then, as someone else has said, “the formality of a Court (or Board) hearing would appear to be superfluous”. 68 \n\nJurisdiction of the Boards \n\nIn one of the appeals heard by the newly-established Appeals Board, the Commissioner, Buttrose J., obited that “if there is a question of title, I should have to stop the proceedings right now because I do not think I have jurisdiction to deal with it. It should be by way of case stated in which case I have power to do it or it should be done by some-body. I am merely sitting here to try to assess the value”. 69 The question that may properly be asked is what is the jurisdiction of the Board? That the Board is primarily concerned with the question of valuation goes without saying. Does the Board have jurisdiction on points of law? Section 19 of the Act says that the Board is constituted “for the purpose of hearing appeals in respect of any award”. The ex-pression “appeals in respect of any award” may well cover appeals on question of law, say, where the Collector values the land at a date other than the date of the publication of the Declaration. Part IV of the Act says “the Commissioner sitting alone” shall decide the dispute, if any, as to apportionment (s. 38(1)). A dispute as to apportionment would naturally involve points of law like construction of documents, etc. Again, as already discussed, the Government may be compelled under section 40(3) to acquire land temporarily occupied by it but which has become permanently unfit for the purpose for which it was used before occupation by Government. Section 44 says in case of dispute as to the condition of the land, the Collector shall refer the matter for determination of the Board. The picture is however confounded by some other seemingly contra-dictory provisions. As has been pointed out earlier, the Collector may 67. Land Acquisition Reference No. 6 of 1954. 68. See note 20. 69. Indo-Australain Trading Co. v. Collector of Land Revenue A.B. No. 5 of 1967. 26 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1in the course of his enquiry refer any question of law for the determina-tion of the courts. Section 49 prohibits the acquisition of part only of a house which is reasonably required for the full and unimpaired use of the house. In case of dispute as to whether a part of a house is reasonably so required, the Collector may refer the matter for the determination of the High Court. But why is the Board side-stepped? Is all this indicative of the Board’s incompetence to decide on points of law? Section 30 refers to the Board’s power to refer for the determination of the Appellate Court on matters of law. Though this provision would appear to be dis-cretionary, it does cast some doubts on the Board’s jurisdiction on points of law. The true position is, it is submitted, that the Board has discretionary jurisdiction to decide on points of law. It is probable that the legisla-ture, fully aware of the likelihood of a layman presiding over the Board as a result of its omission to stipulate qualifications required of the Commissioners, does not deem it advisable to impose upon the Board a duty to decide on points of law. It is left to the discretion of the Board whether to take up the dispute on points of law right up to the Appellate Court or to decide on it leaving it to the appellant to appeal. \n\nAppeal from the Board’s decisions \n\nThe Board’s decisions are not appealable, except on points of law when the amount of award by the Board exceeds 5,000 dollars (s. 29 (2)). This limitation is contributory to the charge of ‘incursion into the sub-ject’s right of appeal’ by the new legislation. It is submitted that adistinction must be made between right of appeal against the Collector’s award and that against the Board’s decision. In the former, the right is completely unfettered. Certain limitations to the right of appeal in the second instance are considered desirable as otherwise the existence of the Board would become superfluous. The usefulness of extending the right to points of fact is rather dubious in the light of the experience under the old law. There was always a reluctance on the part of an appellate court to interfere with the trial judge’s basis of compensation unless some serious errors were committed. In this connection, their Lordships in the court of appeal observed that “in matters of this kind an appeal tribunal is loth to interfere with the judgment of the trial court, especially when, as in this case, the learned trial judge had the assistance of two qualified assessors, unless it has been demonstrated that there was some substantial error in the basis of assessment”. 70 VI CONCLUSION The evolution of the concept of land acquisition has all along been a painful adjustment of some conventional value judgments to the in-creasing complexities of modern life. It is certainly not unnatural that any extension of the State’s power in this direction will invariably meet with every resistance on the part of those who so ardently believe in the inalienablity of the citizen’s right to property and its immunity from governmental and individual’s interference. It has been apparent 70. Land Acquisition Reference No. 2 of 1956. Appeal No. 23 of 1958. July 1968 COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN 27 SINGAPORE throughout our discussion of the law of compulsory land acquisition in Singapore that the State has been given a wider latitude in the field of acquisition activities. It has also to be acknowledged that the new law has since its birth created much suspicion and fear in the minds of a great number of property owners in the country. However, it is re-assuring to note that very few have thought it convenient to question the propriety of the State’s claim for wider powers in order to discharge efficiently its functions as dispenser of social services and as promoter of economic growth. Complaints and criticisms have centred around the possibility of abuse and misuse and the alleged discriminatory nature of some of the provisions. Accordingly, checks and balances, judicial or otherwise, have been advocated. The formula stated by Dicey 71 a century ago that a Government must not have “arbitrary or even wide discretionary powers” and that “the rule of law demands equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land as administered by the ordinary law courts” has almost become a matter of academic interest in view of the growth of administrative powers and justice that is the prevalent trend everywhere and that is, it is submitted, the moving spirit behind many of the innovations in our new law of land acquisition. In spite of all its advantages and expediency, administrative justice carries with it an irreducible minimum of risks that must be taken for granted. One of these is its liability for abuse and misuse. Checks and balances against executive excesses might be devised as have been so often attempted by some leading text-books on administrative law. It would be ideal if every exercise of adminis-trative discretion could be placed against judicial review, particularly when what is at stake is the individual’s fundamental right to property and liberty. However, that the efficacy of judicial review and procedural safeguards must not be overstated is clearly demonstrated when Woodrow Wilson says that “Government is not a machine but a living thing . . . . No living thing can have its organs off-set against each other as checks, and live . . . . Government is not a body of blind forces; it is a body of men, with highly differentiated functions no doubt, in our modern day of specialization, but with a common task and purpose. Their co-operation is indispensable, their warfare fatal . . . .”. 72 It is therefore submitted that no amount of conceptual absolutes and procedural safeguards can stop a government from abusing its authority if it is really so determined. In this connection, it may not be out of context to quote the Prime Minister, “We could have all the checks and balances we want within the Constitution. But if you have a bad elected government the whole Cabinet consisting of people properly elected and determined to wreck the country, there is nothing that could be done other than get such a government out as quickly as possible, if possible constitutionally, if not some other means must be found by the commu-nity. It is as simple as that”. 73 71. Law of the Constitution, (10th ed.), (1959), Chap. 4. 72. Constitutional Government in the United States, p. 56. 73. In his speech on the Report of the Constitutional Commission, reported in Hansard Vol. 25 No. 18 at p. 1298. 28 MALAYA LAW REVIEW Vol. 10 No. 1 To conclude, let us take the advice of Professor W. Friedmann, “instead of devoting all our attention to the minute details of safeguards, we should, perhaps do a little rethinking on the meaning of such basic values as liberty and property in the legal and social context of contem-porary society”. 74 L IM C HIN Joo* 74.

Puchniak, Umakanth Varottil *\n\nABSTRACT \n\nState owned enterprises are generally regarded as inefficient firms because of political objectives, external interference, and corruption. Notwithstanding this, studies have shown that Singapore state owned enterprises exhibit higher valuations than those of non-GLCs after controlling for firm specific factors and also have better corporate governance practices. In this paper, the authors posit an explanation. This explanation draws on the political, social and economic context that Singapore found herself in during the period of self-governance to the early years of independence from the late 1950s to the early 70s. The paper offers the view that the difficult economic conditions coupled with a contested democratic political environment in Singapore during this period played a significant role in fostering good political governance in Singapore which was in turn transposed to her state owned enterprises. \n\nKey words:Singapore, State owned enterprises, corporate governance,Singapore history  \n\n> *\n\nAll of the Faculty of Law and Centre for Law and Business, National University of Singapore.

In fact, as recently as a decade ago, many pundits posited that SOEs were on the verge of extinction. 1 Around that time, two American academic luminaries boldly declared the “End of History for Corporate Law” claiming that the market-oriented model of the shareholder-centric corporation had triumphed over its principal competitors (SOEs included). 2\n\nOver the last decade, however, the renaissance of SOEs has made comparative corporate law seem more like the beginning of time rather than the end of history. In this new era, SOEs have made a valiant return from the precipice of extinction and now compose a substantial portion of the world’s most powerful corporations. Indeed, SOEs have come to dominate several key global industries and are the backbone of the Chinese economy (which is on course to become the world’s largest economy). 3\n\nThe meteoric rise of SOEs, combined with the spectacular economic growth of China, has made the future of SOEs in China an issue of global importance. The success and sustainability of China’s SOEs has been vigorously debated both within China and internationally. In the midst of this debate, however, a somewhat surprising view appears to be emerging: that Singapore’s SOEs (also referred to in Singapore as government-linked companies or GLCs) may provide a good model for reforming China’s SOE Model. 4 In fact, very recently, the Chinese government decided that by 2020 the Singapore GLC Model                                \n\n> 1The Long View: And The Winner Is…: Special Report: State Capitalism ,T HE ECONOMIST (Jan. 21, 2012).\n> 2Henry Hansmann&ReinierKraakman, The End of History for Corporate Law , 89 G EO .L.

This article, however, avoids this temptation. Rather, it focuses on a more basic, yet fundamentally important, question that seems to have been largely overlooked in the rush to reform: What is the historical foundationand important drivers of the Singapore GLC Model? By answering this question, this article hopes to clarify exactly what Chinais aiming to transplant or, indeed, whether what China (or others) aims to transplant is even transplantable at all. Ultimately, this article concludes that the Singapore GLC Model is so closely intertwined with Singapore’s idiosyncratic history and unique regulatory culture that, although the model has been extremely successful within Singapore, transplanting it to China (and we suspect, most likely, anywhere else) could be difficult. In the process of arriving at this conclusion, this article further illuminates two broader points that cut to the core of comparative corporate law theory. First, as alluded to above, the success of the Singapore GLC Model and China’s ambition toemulateit challenge notions that corporate governance systems are converging towards a market-oriented (American) model of the shareholder-centric corporation. 6 Indeed, an examination of the historical evolution of the Singapore GLC Model illustrates that a highly successful economy and system of corporate governance can be built on a foundation of corporations that have the government (and not only private free-market actors) as their ultimate controlling shareholder. Importantly, this feature of Singapore corporate governance has been maintained even as Singapore has moved from a developing, to a developed, and now to a world-leading economy that generates a GDP per person that exceeds all of the G7 countries 7 and has produced the world’s highest percentage of millionaires. 8              \n\n> 530 Chinese SOEs to Follow Temasek Model by 2020 ,W ANT CHINA TIMES (May 30, 2014).\n> 6Hansmann&Kraakman, supra note 2.\n> 7World Economic Outlook Database, April 2014, International Monetary Fund Database updated on 8 April 2014.

In fact, in Singapore’s case empirical evidence suggests that, at least in certain circumstances, the converse may be true. As such, although the Singapore GLC Model may yet prove to be difficult to transplant, it suggests that even in today’s global economy there remains many paths to corporate governance success. Rather than finding any one model, the key to effective corporate governance (if there is one at all) appears to be finding a system that fits each particular jurisdiction’s economic, institutional, historical, political and cultural environment, which will, of course, vary (sometimes substantially) from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and even within each jurisdiction over time. 9\n\nI. THE ATTRACTION OF THE SINGAPORE MODEL In 1960, a year after Singapore attained full internal self-governance, it had a GDP per capita of US$428 that was close to the world average 10 and faced significant challenges. 11 Today, Singapore is one of the richest countries in the world. With virtually no natural resources, effective governance has been the key to Singapore’s success. This has not gone unnoticed. For the past eight years, the World Bank has recognized Singapore as having the best regulatory and economic environment in the world for doing business. 12 Transparency International consistently ranks Singapore in the top five countries in the world for having the lowest level of corruption. 13 The Wall Street Journal and The Heritage Foundation consistently rank Singapore in the top few countries in the world with                             \n\n> 9For another example of this approach to successful corporate governance see, Dan W.

In fact, the dispersedly-held, shareholder-centric, Berle-Means corporation virtually does not exist in Singapore. To the contrary, Singapore’s corporate governance system is built almost entirely on companies owned by concentrated block-shareholders. In fact, over 90% of Singapore’s public listed companies have block shareholders who exercise controlling power. 17 In addition, empirical evidence suggests that as Singapore’s wealth has increased, its concentration of shareholdings has also increased—the opposite of what proponents of the American corporate governance model would predict. 18 Even more incongruent with the American, market-oriented, shareholder-centric model, is that listed companies in which the government is the controlling shareholder (i.e., GLCs) account for 37% of the total stock market capitalization in Singapore. 19 As such, the Singapore government is by far Singapore’s most powerfulshareholder.

Perhaps even more attractive to Chinese Communist Party officials, however, is the evidence that on a micro-economic level the Singapore GLC Modelappears to produce strong corporate performance and promotes good corporate governance—something which has tended to elude Chinese SOEs. To the extent that investors will demand a discount to the share price for companies that are perceived to be inefficient or have sub-optimal governance structures, studies have shown that far from Singapore GLCs trading at a discount to their peers, capital markets in fact value GLCs more highly than non-GLCs. One study estimated this premium at 20% after taking into account other variables that might affect firm value such as industry effects, size and monopoly power, profitability (it being the case that GLCs are generally more profitable), and bankruptcy risk. 20 \n\nAnother study corroborated this by finding that GLCs on average exhibit higher valuations than those of non-GLCs after controlling for firm specific factors. This study concluded that on average GLCs provided superior returns on both assets and equity and are valued more highly than non-GLCs. GLCs also did better in many performance measures and did not appear to be worse off in other measures. As such, they were more highly valued. 21 Interestingly, this study also found that GLCs in general managed their expenses better than non-GLC companies. The lower expense-to-sales ratio among GLCs indicated that GLCs were more profitable because they ran leaner operations. Such a finding demonstrated that GLCs in Singapore were different from the generally inefficient nationalized firm run by governments. 22 In addition, more recent studies suggest that GLCs have implemented better corporate governance practices than non-GLCs—which bodes well for their future sustainability and economic performance. 23                      \n\n> 20 Carlos D.

Of particular importance was the tenuous hold that the People’s Action Party (PAP), which has governed Singapore since independence, had on power at that time. To increase its legitimacy and support, the PAP set out to improve the lives of Singaporeans and this necessitated good economic management. One important aspect of this was to develop the economy beyond entrepot trade. The establishment of GLCs was an important part of the country’s industrialization plan. In Singapore, competent economic management had a strong correlation to political legitimacy and survivability. Although these conditions are not entirely unique to Singapore, a detailed analysis reveals that they are distinctive enough to call into question whether the Singapore GLC Model is easily transplantable. II. SINGAPORE POLITICS AND SOCIETY DURING THE PERIOD OF SELF-GOVERNANCE Given the long period of PAP dominance in Singapore’s political life, it may be difficult to recall that unlike many other post-colonial governments, the PAP government did not initially have strong mass support. Thus, after the publication of the Rendel Report in February 1954 which was to lead to elections the following year towards some degree of self-government, Lee Kuan Yew, who was later to become the first Prime Minister of Singapore, felt it was necessary to form an alliance with extreme left-wing militants who were under the influence of the illegal Malayan Communist Party. While Lee Kuan Yew and his group were aware of the force and discontent of the Chinese educated masses, they realized that an alliance with such men, dangerous though it might be, offered the only path to political success. The future belonged to politicians who could command the allegiance of the Chinese educated. 25 The task was no doubt made more daunting by the fact that Lee              \n\n> 24 W.G. Huff, What is the Singapore model of economic development? , 19 C AMB .J. ECON . 735, 743 (1995) states that the Singapore development model carries the lesson that public enterprise organised through a sort of political entrepreneurship can be run efficiently and at a profit.\n> 25 C.M. TURNBULL ,AHISTORY OF MODERN SINGAPORE ,1819 –2005 (2009), at 255.\n\n9\n\nKuan Yew himself was English educated and could not speak Mandarin or any Chinese dialect fluently. For their part, the left-wing Chinese extremists saw Lee Kuan Yew and his group as a convenient front to gain political power because they were more likely to be acceptable to the British. Thus, in its early days, the PAP was divided into two wings, the non-communists under Lee Kuan Yew and the pro-communists under Lim Chin Siong. During the early years of the PAP, Lim Chin Siong and his wing were the real force in the PAP, commanding the support of organized labour and the Chinese masses. 26 Thus, at the PAP’s third annual conference in August 1957, Lim Chin Siong’s wing won half of the seats for positions to the party’s central executive committee. The future of the moderate non-communist wing appeared precarious and Lee Kuan Yew and an ally, Toh Chin Chye, who was chairman of the party, stepped down from the leadership. A dramatic turn of events occurred soon after when the Labour Front government under Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock arrested thirty-five active communists including five members of the newly elected PAP central executive committee and eleven branch officials. This allowed Lee Kuan Yew and his allies to regain control of the PAP. 27 \n\nIn 1959 new elections were held and the PAP obtained a strong majority winning 43 of 51 seats in the Legislative Assembly. In power, the PAP pursued merger with the Federation of Malaya. An important reason for this was economic survival. Despite considerable progress, industrial development in Singapore in the 1950s was unspectacular and the city could not be regarded as an industrial centre. In 1959 an industrial development programme was initiated in the Federation of Malaya. New industries set up there could obtain ‘pioneer status’ and tariff protection. 28 This was a potentially serious development for Singapore which regarded Malaya as an important economic hinterland. There was also an urgent need to provide employment. While open unemployment at around 5% in 1957 was not exceptionally high, this did not take into account large          \n\n> 26 Id. , at 262.\n> 27 Id. , at 267.\n> 28 W.G. HUFF ,THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF SINGAPORE –TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 289-90 (1994).\n\n10 \n\nnumbers of people who could not be regarded as fully employed. 19% of Singapore households and 25% of individuals were found to be in poverty, which was defined as a household income that was insufficient for minimum standards. 29 The rapid rise in the birth rate also foreshadowed future difficulties. Between 1947 and 1957 Singapore’s population grew at 4.4% annually with natural increase accounting for most of this growth. 30 This would eventually translate into significant labour force growth and government policy had to take this into account. Singapore’s reliance on entrepot commerce and the income from British military bases would be insufficient to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population which would require an increase in social services. 31 In a 1955 report of a mission organized by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Singapore’s ability to meet public financial requirements from domestic resources was doubted unless additional taxes were levied and present balances drawn upon. 32 This was because net public expenditure for social services was expected to increase significantly, albeit from a low level. 33 \n\nGoh Keng Swee, who was later to become Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister, described the political situation faced by the PAP government in the following way: 34 \n\n“As a condition for assuming office [in 1959], we had secured the release of the communist united front leaders who had been jailed by the British. The mass organizations were, therefore, once again under complete communist domination, and the government elected on a social democratic platform was virtually their political prisoner. By 1960, the social democrats in the PAP reluctantly came to the decision that they had to break with the communists, and possibly bring the fight into the open. Their chances of success were extremely small, and it was likely that the communists would then take over the reins of government, either directly or, more likely,                          \n\n> 29 Id. , at 291.\n> 30 Id. , at 292.\n> 31 TURNBULL ,supra note 25, at 275-76.\n> 32 INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (IBRD), THE ECONOMIC\n> DEVELOPMENT OF MALAYA 28 (1955).\n> 33 Id. , at 139.\n> 34 GOH KENG SWEE ,THE PRACTICE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH 96 (1995) (hereinafter “G OH (1995)”).\n\n11 \n\nthrough proxies willing to prostitute themselves for a brief illusion of political glory.” 35 \n\nAlthough it is sometimes remarked that the difficulties of the 1950s and 1960s may be overstated to enhance the role played by the PAP government as led by Lee Kuan Yew, it cannot be doubted that the political climate at that time was fluid and uncertain. To increase its popular support, the PAP government embarked on a programme of social reform. 36 One priority was to construct more public housing. The Housing and Development Board was established on 1 February 1960 with Lim Kim San, who was to later become a government minister, as its first chairman. The Board replaced the Singapore Improvement Trust and was tasked with solving Singapore’s housing problem. At the time, many were living in unhygienic slums and squatter settlements with only 9% living in government flats. In less than three years the Board built 21,000 flats and by 1965 it had built 54,000 flats. Today, about 82% of Singaporeans live in public housing. 37 Other significant steps were to improve health facilities, utilities, and education. For example, expenditure on education rose from $600,000 in 1960 to $10 million in 1963 and the school population increased over the same period from 290,000 to 430,000. The PAP pledged to provide universal free primary schooling as its first educational priority and embarked on a crash school building programme and the recruiting and training of teachers. 38 \n\nSuch ambitious social goals wouldbe unsustainable without economic development. In the 1950s and early 1960s, a generally held view was that Singapore was not viable as an independent entity and had to bepart of Malaya. Historically, Singapore had played an important role in the Malayan economy and it was considered that she would not be economically viable without union with the Federation of Malaya. Singapore’s leaders were keen on merger with the Federation as this would ensure Singapore’s continued access to Malayan markets. On 31 August 1963, Singapore together with Sabah and Sarawak joined        \n\n> 35 He went on to say that at times it seemed that escape from disaster was achieved only through the assistance of a benevolent Providence, Id. , at 98.\n> 36 TURNBULL ,supra note 25, at 284 – 285.\n> 37 See http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10320p.nsf/w/AboutUsHDBHistory?OpenDocument .\n> 38 TURNBULL ,supra note 25 at 284.\n\n12 \n\nthe Federation of Malaya to form the new Federation of Malaysia. However,the period of merger proved to be a difficult one and on 9 August 1965 Singapore ceased to be part of Malaysia. The separation from Malaysia was traumatic for the Singapore leadership as many within the PAP had not conceived that Singapore would have to go it alone 39 though Goh Keng Swee was convinced by July 1965 that Singapore’s economy could only flourish if it was completely free of control from the Malaysian central government. 40 A further potentially devastating blow was to come several years later when on 15 January 1968 the British government announced that its forces east of Suez would be withdrawn in December 1971. Given that the British military bases in Singapore provided substantial employment, not to mention the importance to the economy of the businesses that supported the military bases, this was a severe setback to the government of a new and developing country. 41 Beyond the immediate economic consequences, the withdrawal of British forces also meant that Singapore would have to invest more in building up its military. This would place further pressure on its public finances. There was also the issue of confidence in Singapore’s future which was necessary to attract investment into the country. 42 \n\nIt has been said that the beginnings of a significantly expanded and more intrusive role played by the government in the economy can be traced to the announcement of the  \n\n> 39\n\nIn his autobiography, L EE KUAN YEW , FROM THIRD WORLD TO FIRST – THE SINGAPORE STORY : 1965-2000 (2000), he wrote at 19 that he never expected to find himself in charge of an independent Singapore which faced “tremendous odds with an improbable chance of survival. Singapore was not a natural country but man-made, a trading post the British had developed into a nodal point in their world-wide maritime empire. We inherited the island without its hinterland, a heart without a body.” See also T URNBULL ,supra note 25, at 274 – 275.  \n\n> 40\n\nTURNBULL ,supra note 25, at 295. He was probably alone in this view, id. , at 299. Goh Keng Swee admitted that the expulsion from Malaysia was a terrifying experience for Singaporeans of his generation, see his speech in March 1986 to the Government of Egypt titled “Transformation of Singapore’s Economy, 1960-1985” reproduced in LINDA LOW (ED .), WEALTH OF EAST ASIAN NATIONS :\n\nSPEECHES AND WRITINGS BY GOH KENG SWEE (1995) ( hereinafter “Goh (1986)”), at 24.  \n\n> 41\n\nLEE KUAN YEW ,supra note 39, at 69 estimated that British military expenditure was some 20% of Singapore’s GDP, providing over 30,000 jobs in direct employment and another 40,000 in support services. Lawrence B. Krause, Government as Entrepreneur in M ANAGEMENT OF SUCCESS : THE \n\nMOULDING OF MODERN SINGAPORE 438 (1989) stated the British expenditures constituted 12.7% of GDP in 1967 and were responsible, directly and indirectly, for the employment of 38,000 local workers, 20% of the work force.  \n\n> 42\n\nSingapore’s vulnerability, or perceived vulnerability, is still an important element in government policy and rhetoric today. E.g. see GAVIN PEEBLES & PETER WILSON , ECONOMIC GROWTH AND \n\nDEVELOPMENT IN SINGAPORE – PAST AND FUTURE 6-7 (2002). 13 \n\nmilitary withdrawal. 43 Prior to this the government confined itself mainly to more traditional activities and to indirect involvement in the economy. 44 Indeed Goh Keng Swee stated that by 1968 a change in emphasis took place in Singapore’s industrial promotion policy. Industrial development acquired a fresh urgency as a result of the decision by the British Labour Government to accelerate the end of the British military presence east of Suez. 45 The impending military withdrawal brought about a change in Singapore’s economic path that has endured notwithstandingher development as an advanced economy today. III. THE FOCUS ON INDUSTRIALISATION TO BRING ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SINGAPORE Goh Keng Swee, who became Finance Minister in 1959, saw industrialization as the means to the economic growth that would provide part of the solution to the problems outlined earlier. Before the 1959 election he had called for industrialisation as the key to rapid economic growth. This would mop up unemployment and finance social reform. 46 Thus the new PAP government adopted many of the policies of the previous government such as the establishment of industrial estates and tax incentives to attract new enterprises and encourage the expansion of existing ones. It also set up the Economic Development Board  \n\n> 43\n\nOw Chin Hock, Singapore in N GUYEN TRUONG (ED .), THE ROLE OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISE IN NATIONAL \n\nDEVELOPMENT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA : PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS 163(1976). After winning the 1968 general election, two of the policy directions laid down by the PAP government were the stimulation of economic growth through the cultivation of new activities and by taking advantage of new economic opportunities, and increased functional specialization in the institutions concerned with economic development. These policy directives led to the establishment of a number of public enterprises and also brought direct government participation into new spheres such as manufacturing, transport, trading and banking. The government no longer confined itself to an indirect economic role. It assumed entrepreneurial responsibilities and moved into areas which had traditionally been in the hands of the private sector. According to Ow Chin Hock, id ., at 158, this can be contrasted with the government’s approach in its State Development Plan, 1961 – 1964, which focused on the pattern and financing of government development expenditure, which would support and complement the industrialisationprogramme. From this plan it could be seen that although the government envisaged a larger role for itself in economic development, it confined itself to the indirect role of providing economic infrastructure and incentives to attract foreign investment and promote industrial growth.  \n\n> 44\n\nKrause, supra note 41, at 438.  \n\n> 45\n\nGOH (1995), supra note 34, at 9.  \n\n> 46\n\nTURNBULL , supra note 25, at 276. L EE KUAN YEW , supra note 39, at 67 said that after grappling with the problem of unemployment for years since taking office in 1959, “all of us in the cabinet knew that the only way to survive was to industrialize. We had reached the limits of our entrepot trade. The outlook was a further decline”. The need for an industrial drive was also recognized by the previous government, see R. LE BLANC , SINGAPORE : THE SOCIO -E CONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF A CITY -S TATE 13 (2008). 14 \n\n(EDB) as a replacement for the Singapore Industrial Promotion Board. The role of the EDB was to attract new businesses to Singapore to enable the country to develop amanufacturing base. EDB’s first foray into industrialisation was made in the hope that it would create 214,000 new jobs by 1970 to achieve full employment. 47 Industrialisation efforts were initially directed towards import substituting industries which was the policy adopted in the Federation of Malaya. This policy was later abandoned when Singapore ceased to be part of Malaysia. In its place came export oriented industrialisation. 48 \n\nOne difficulty with the industrialisation strategy was that Singapore’s largely entrepot economy did not naturally lend itself to industrialisation. The base of human capital necessary for this was insufficient, and thegovernment may also not have been able or willing to look to the Chinese educated businessmen who had traditionally made up Singapore’s entrepreneurs. 49 The capital markets were relatively under-developed and may also not have been able to support large private undertakings, while the private sector could also have been risk averse. 50 A former EDB Chairman has gone so far as to say that Singapore had no industrial base whatsoever to build on. 51 Multinational corporations were one substitute for this, the other being strong state involvement in certain sectors of the economy. 52 It was the government’s perceived need to support the transformation of the Singapore economy that led to the formation of GLCs.Singapore’s leaders found control over key domestic markets and institutions the most effective way to respond to opportunities in the world economy to meet the main planning objectives of absorbing  \n\n> 47\n\nChan Chin Bock, How Singapore Became a Newly Industrialised Economy in S INGAPORE ECONOMIC \n\nDEVELOPMENT BOARD , HEART WORK 2 – EDB & PARTNERS : NEW FRONTIERS FOR THE SINGAPORE \n\nECONOMY 13 (2011).  \n\n> 48\n\nGoh (1986), supra note 40, at 24 - 25 referred to the period 1960 – 1965 as the first phase of economic development in Singapore and said that this phase ended with little achieved. Nevertheless some valuable lessons were learnt including that import substitution industrialization was not a feasible policy for Singapore; another option was to produce for the export market; and the importance of political stability.  \n\n> 49\n\nHUFF supra note28, at 320.  \n\n> 50\n\nLee Sheng Yi, Public Enterprise and Economic Development in Singapore , 21(2) MALAYAN \n\nECONOMIC REVIEW 49, 51(1976).  \n\n> 51\n\nChan , supra note 47, at 13.

To ameliorate the impact on Singapore from the withdrawal of British troops, the British government agreed to hand over some of its assets. One was the naval dockyard at Sembawang which was handed over for a token sum of SGD1.00. Sembawang Shipyard Pte Ltd was established on 19 June 1968 to begin business as a commercial ship repairer with Swan Hunter (International) Limited as Managing Agent.Similarly, Keppel Shipyard (Pte) Ltd was established in 1968 when Keppel Harbour was taken over from the British Royal Navy. The former Royal Air Force Changi air base was chosen in 1975 to be the site of Singapore’s international airport and the site expanded through land reclamation. Today it is managed by Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd and is one of the most successful airports in the world. Other properties that the British handed over to Singapore included Sentosa island which is a major tourism attraction; the former British Army headquarters at Fort Canning; the Seletar military airfield; and the Pasir Panjang military complex which now houses most of the academic departments of the National University of Singapore, the country’s oldest university. The Singapore government did not stop at establishing GLCs from the assets handed over by the British. Indeed thegovernment went well beyond what the colonial government would have thought was within its remit. GLCs were a means for the government to take the lead in establishing new industries, including in the services sector, where the private sector could not or would not. Indeed, National Iron and Steel Mills Limited was incorporated as early as 12 August 1961 and was the first manufacturing plant in the Jurong Industrial Estate that the government had established. 55 The Development Bank of Singapore, now known simply as DBS, was established in 1968 to take over the development finance section from EDB. It was thus an important catalyst for Singapore’s industrial development in the early       \n\n> 53 Huff, supra note 24, at 748 citing an interview with Goh Keng Swee.\n> 54 HUFF ,supra note 28, at 331.\n> 55 Some companies such as National Iron and Steel Mills Limited were established as joint ventures with Singaporean and overseas investors.\n\n16 \n\nyears after independence. Lee Kuan Yew explained that DBS helped finance entrepreneurs who needed venture capital because the established banks had no experience outside trade financing and were too conservative and reluctant to lend to would be manufacturers. 56 \n\nOther important GLCs that were established included Singapore International Airlines; Neptune Orient Lines which was the national shipping company; 57 and Chartered Industries of Singapore Pte Ltd which was established to make ordnance for the Singapore Armed Forces. In 1968 Singapore Shipbuilding & Engineering Pte Ltd, now known as ST Marine Limited, was established to support the Singapore Navy, and in 1975 Singapore Technologies Aerospace Pte Ltd 58 was formed to support the Singapore Air Force. Today, Chartered Industries, ST Marine and ST Aerospace are all part of the ST Engineering group, one of Singapore’s largest GLCs. It has also diversified its customer base significantly with much of its business today coming from commercial companies. 59 \n\nThe circumstances that Singapore found herself in probably explain the importance of GLCs in her economy compared to other Asian peers such as Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. Hong Kong’s development was largely driven by private enterprise. While many large companies in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan did benefit from state support, it did not lead to widespread government ownership of companies. What may have distinguished Singapore from these economies were the generosity of the British in giving Singapore land (without charge) that could be used for economic or defence purposes, and the perceived market failure of a lack of entrepreneurs to support industrialisation. 60 Both factors acting in tandem caused the state to become a significant market participant. 61 Indeed, in 1977 Goh Keng Swee explained that government owned enterprises                                                    \n\n> 56 LEE KUAN YEW ,supra note 39, at 77.\n> 57 Thus GLCs were also established in the services sector as shown by Singapore International Airlines and Neptune Orient Lines.\n> 58 Today it is known as ST Aerospace Limited.\n> 59 Chua Beng Huat, State-owned enterprises, state-capitalism and social distribution in Singapore ”(forthcoming in T HE PACIFIC REVIEW ) has also described how Singapore used certain statutory boards that existed during the colonial period and delinked their regulatory functions from the supply of services, thus allowing the government to regulate the prices of services provided domestically while simultaneously enabling the suppliers to become commercial enterprises that were able to take advantage of opportunities in Singapore and abroad, in the process transforming them into multinational corporations.\n> 60 LEE KUAN YEW ,supra note 39, at 86; Lee Sheng Yi, supra note 50, at 55.\n> 61 It has also been pointed out that the Singapore government’s role as an entrepreneur also affected savings behaviour which helped to finance the necessary capital accumulation for economic development, see GREGOR HOPF ,SAVING AND INVESTMENT :THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF\n\n17 \n\nin Singapore came about because of the “colonial inheritance” and to encourage investors to take the plunge which was especially important in the early years of industrialisation when private investors needed a lot of encouragement and which continued later when new needs were identified. 62 The domestic market was too small to support industry and business experience was confined to import and export trade, banking, and regional shipping instead of industrial enterprises. 63 Unlike nationalisation which did not create new wealth but only effected a transfer of ownership and control, the government established new enterprises to create new wealth and jobs to add to the growth of the Gross National Product. Public ownership did not come about because of ideological grounds 64 though the fact that the PAP was established as a socialist political party may have been a contributing factor as there would have been no ideological aversion to state ownership. 65 Underpinning all this was the insecurity brought about by the reality of an independent Singapore without a hinterland. 66 \n\nThe PAP’s approach to economic survival was thus a pragmatic one.Goh Keng Swee said that the PAP had to try a more activist and interventionist approach as the laissez faire \n\npolicies of the colonial era had led to little economic growth, massive unemployment, wretched housing, and inadequate education. An aspect of this more interventionist approach was the government’s direct effort in promoting industrial growth through GLCs which in turn created substantial employment. 67 \n\nSINGAPORE 1965-99 – AN IN -DEPTH LOOK AT THE COUNTRY ’S SAVING BEHAVIOUR AND GOVERNMENT CONTROL 136-38 (2009).  \n\n> 62\n\nGoh Keng Swee, Public Enterprises , speech at the NTUC INCOME Annual General Meeting, Jun. 20, 1977reproduced in L OW , , supra note40 (hereinafter “Goh (1977)”), at 122 – 123.

Ow Chin Hock, supra note 43, at 169, also suggests that government participation served as a safeguard against excessive foreign control and ownership.  \n\n> 66\n\nThere have been suggestions that the PAP government used the opportunity presented by Singapore’s expulsion from Malaysia to engender a constant sense of crisis so as to build support for the PAP and encourage Singaporeans to make sacrifices for the future, see e.g. H OPF , supra note 61, at 324 – 326; PEEBLES & WILSON , supra note 42 at 7. While it is true that the PAP government does try to justify many policies on the basis of Singapore’s inherent vulnerability as a small state, and was undoubtedly astute enough to make use of Singapore’s expulsion to solidify its support, it is suggested that its fear of going it alone was genuine. Historically, geographically and culturally Singapore was bound to the Malayan peninsula and the idea of an independent Singapore separate from Malaya would not have been the preferred option at that time and unthinkable to a large part of the population.  \n\n> 67\n\nGoh (1995), supra note 34, at 104 - 105. 18 \n\nThe Singapore government was not unaware of the risks of such an approach. Lee Kuan Yew has written of his fear that the GLCs would become subsidised and loss making nationalised corporations as had happened in many new countries. However, he was persuaded by Hon Sui Sen, who was then a Permanent Secretary and later became Minister for Finance, that it was possible to succeed as these companies could compete in the market. If they were not profitable they would be shut down. Lee Kuan Yew, together with other cabinet colleagues such as Goh Keng Swee, thought this bold plan was worth the risk given the dearth of entrepreneurs. 68 \n\nSingapore’s industrialisation efforts proved successful. The economy saw a shift to manufacturing. Its share in total output grew from 16.6% in 1960 to 29.4% by 1979. In 1992, manufacturing contributed 27.6% of GDP and accounted for 27.5% of employment. 69 Public enterprises were, by the first half of 1974, thought to account for 14 – 16% of total manufacturing output. 70 The successful management of the Singapore economy is a major factor for the PAP’s longevity as the ruling party in Singapore.Accordingly, when elections were held in September 1963 the PAP gained a clear victory, winning 31 out of 51 seats. The BarisanSosialis, which had been formed by former PAP members, managed to win 13 and the United People’s Party won 1. The PAP’s victory in the following election held in 1968 was even more comprehensive. The BarisanSosialis boycotted the election and the ruling party won every seat that was contested. The Barisan’s boycott in 1968 meant that the outcome of the election was a foregone conclusion. The 1963 election is therefore a better indicator of a decisive switch in popular support to the PAP. While it is true that the Barisan operated at a disadvantage in that election as some of its leaders were in prison, the outcome was not certain. According to a historian, the result of the 1963 polls appeared to hang in the balance and the PAP’s clear victory was a surprise to both PAP and Barisan supporters alike. 71 The PAP obtained just under 47% of the popular vote while the Barisan obtained around 33%. A major reason           \n\n> 68 LEE KUAN YEW ,supra note 39, at 87.\n> 69 Huff, supra note 24, at 739.\n> 70 Lee Sheng Yi, supra note 50,at 64.\n> 71 TURNBULL ,supra note 25, at 286.\n\n19 \n\nfor this was the PAP’s governance record. The party’s good economic management and social policies had helped it to garner more support from the populace. As the PAP leadership under Lee Kuan Yew was aware of its initially precarious position within Singapore’s political arena, and sought to win the support of the majority of Singaporeans, their strategy was to improve the social and economic conditions of the people.Good economic management was regarded as an important key to strengthening the PAP’s political position, and government entrepreneurship was intended to facilitate Singapore’s economic development. 72 GLCs gave the government considerable influence in certain segments of the economy. The link between economic legitimacy and political power in Singapore cannot be understated. Singapore has for most of her modern history been a largely immigrant society focussed on commercial enterprise.The Chinese, Indians and other races that came to Singapore did so to engage in trade or to find work. By the end of the nineteenth century Singapore had a secure place in the pattern of world trade as a staple port, the entrepot for Southeast Asian raw materials and Western manufactured goods, with an increasingly sophisticated infrastructure of commercial institutions and expertise. 73 Singapore today is still essentially a commercial city and her survival is premised on her ability to be commercially relevant to the wider region around her and as an important node for Western commercial enterprises and investors. Thus while economic growth is important to all countries, it has an almost existential condition in Singapore. It is therefore not surprising that economic legitimacy is probably the most important determinant of political legitimacy in Singapore. The social contract with the people that has kept the PAP government in power since independence is widely accepted to be the promise of employment and a fair distribution of economic benefits, a significant part of which is represented by the provision of good public housing which a large majority of Singaporeans reside in. 74 It has been suggested that any      \n\n> 72 Goh(1995), supra note 34, at 103 refers to the government having to involve itself in direct ownership and control of many industrial, financial and commercial enterprises to bring about economic growth.\n> 73 TURNBULL ,supra note 25, at 105.\n> 74 The perception that this social contract is less effective today was a major contributing factor to the results of the 2011 General Election in Singapore which saw the opposition winning an unprecedented 6 out of the 87 elected seats in Parliament and the loss of 2 cabinet ministers. Subsequently, the\n\n20 \n\nserious diminution of the positions of GLCs would have major implications for the political regime, one reason being that the fortunes of the GLCs will influence the reformulation of any new social contract between the government and Singapore’s citizens. 75 Thus fortuitously from the outset the conditions to encourage the responsible management of GLCs were in place. The management of GLCs in the Singapore context cannot be separated from the overall approach that the PAP government adopted in the development of the Singapore economy.After all it was civil servants acting at the behest of their political masterswho were tasked in the earlier years with managing GLCs which they did with the goal of economic development in mind. In keeping with the goal of fostering good governance, the government also adopted a zero tolerance approach to corruption. It is well known that corruption was fairly widespread in Singapore in the 1950s and 1960s and the PAP set out to contrast its conduct with that of the previous Labour Front government. Much of the corruption in Singapore at the time was of the petty kind but there were also larger scandals. The PAP government set out to eradicate corruption and today Singapore is regarded as one of the least corrupt countries. This undoubtedly was also a factor in GLCs in Singapore being relatively well managed and not the victims of rent seeking that often occur in SOEs elsewhere. Indeed the aversion of the PAP government to corruption, particularly in the public sector, is evidenced by the fact that under Singapore law, a public servant who receives any gratification shall be presumed to have received such gratification corruptly as an inducement or reward unless the contrary is proved by such public servant. 76 \n\nWith GLCs seen as an important engine in the development of the Singapore economy, the main method chosen by the government to exercise control over GLCs when civil servants ceased to manage such companies was the appointment of top civil servants to the boards of these companies. These civil servants serve a monitoring function but       \n\n> Workers Party won a by-election in January 2013 when the PAP Speaker of Parliament resigned his seat.\n> 75 GarryRodan, International capital, Singapore’s state companies, and security , 36 C RITICAL ASIAN\n> STUDIES 479, 480(2004).\n> 76 Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241), ¶ 8. The general position without the presumption is that the prosecution has to prove both the gratification and that such gratification was solicited or given “as an inducement to or reward for” doing or forbearing to do something, Prevention of Corruption Act, ¶ 5.\n\n21 \n\notherwise government control is very loose. The government makes no attempt to appoint managers or other personnel to manage the companies and normally does not interfere in the management of GLCs. 77 The boards of GLCs are policy boards rather than functional (managerial) ones. 78 This model has endured and is still largely in operation today though one important difference is the interposition of a company to play the role that the state once did. Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd was incorporated on 1 January 1974 to hold and manage the investments and assets previously held by the Singapore government. 79 Its sole shareholder is the Minister for Finance and the transfer of government assets to Temasek was to allow it to manage those assets on a commercial basis. 80 \n\nTemasek states that it is an engaged shareholder that promotes sound corporate governance in its portfolio companies. This includes supporting the formation of high calibre, experienced and diverse boards to guide and complement management leadership. Temasek’s policy is not to direct the business operations or decisions of the companies in its portfolio and to leave this to their respective boards and management. Temasek does, however, advocate that boards be independent of management in order to provide effective oversight and supervision of management. This includes having mostly non-executive members on boards with the strength and experience to oversee management. Similarly, Temasek advocates that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles be held by separate persons, independent of each other. 81 As with the position soon after independence, top civil servants as well as former top civil servants serve on the boards and senior management of many GLCs.It is not uncommon for such persons and other  \n\n> 77\n\nLee Sheng Yi, supra note 50, at 57; Goh (1977), supra note 62, at 124. Though it was said in the 1970s that certain top civil servants were found to sit on several boards at the same time and that such interlocking directorships allowed control and coordination with government policies to be ensured, see Ow Chin Hock, supra note 43, at 177, and also P HILLIP N. PILLAI , STATE ENTERPRISE IN SINGAPORE :\n\nLEGAL IMPORTATION AND DEVELOPMENT 117, 202-04 (1983). Pillai points out that government directors are clustered along related industries to allow specialization and prevent over-extension that would lead to such directors being unable to expand adequate time and energy on the activities of their companies. Specialization means that these directors would be familiar with the industry, trends and developments and could more readily contribute and safeguard the state’s investment than if they were directors of companies in widely disparate groups.  \n\n> 78\n\nPILLAI ,supra note 77, at 116.  \n\n> 79\n\nA commentator has opined that the state-business relationship is even closer today, especially in the previous decade when Temasek Holdings and its GLCs have expanded, see Ho Khai Leong, Political Consolidation in Singapore: Connecting the Party, the Government and the Expanding State in TERENCE CHONG (ED .)

It is possible to see in such arrangements thefostering of continued loyalty to the government 82 in addition to participation in key sectors of the economy. Having GLCs that are efficiently run advances these objectives. It is noteworthy that Temasek has been a strong advocateof independent (American-style) boards, which focus primarily on monitoring management as opposed to being involved directly in the management of GLCs. In fact,until very recently, Singapore’s Code on Corporate Governancerequired only that independent directors be independent from management, but not controlling shareholders. Although such a definition resonates closely with the law, practice and evolutionof independent directors in the United States, it contrasts sharply with the position taken by most other jurisdictions in which controlling shareholders predominate. At first blush, Singapore’s traditionally narrow definition of independence appears to call into question the authenticity of hercommitment to truly independent boards. Indeed, conventional comparative corporate governance theory suggests that the primary role of independent directors in a controlling shareholder environment should beto monitor controlling shareholders with the ultimate goal of protecting minority shareholdersby policing private benefits of control—a task that is unlikely to be performed adequately by directors connected with the controlling shareholder. Interestingly, however,it appears that conventional corporate governance theorymay not apply to Temasek in this caseas the foundational assumption that controlling shareholdersare strongly incentivized to extract private benefits of control does not fit intoTemasek’s incentive structure. To the contrary, based on our analysis above, it appears that Temasek is highly incentivized to use its controlling power to ensure that GLCs are run efficiently as this serves its (and, ultimately,          \n\n> 82 For example, C ARL A. TROCKI ,SINGAPORE :WEALTH ,POWER AND THE CULTURE OF CONTROL 174\n> (2006) offers the view that the GLCs and statutory boards are important political tools as they provide the government with a ready means of rewarding its bureaucratic allies with jobs as directors or managers of these enterprises. They also act as a recruiting ground for talent. Cf PILLAI ,supra note 77, at 206, who asserts that there is an absence of the political spoils system by which the ruling party appoints directors to state enterprises on the basis of political expediency and as rewards for political service, rather than ability or potential contribution to the enterprise.\n\n23 \n\nthe PAP’s)long-term interests. 83 This is further bolstered by the existence of strong functional substitutes (to board independence) such as the robust public enforcement mechanism in Singapore. CONCLUSION: REFLECTING UPON THE EVOLUTION OF GLCs IN SINGAPORE As evident from the preceding discussion, Singapore adopted a unique trajectory towards growth that was spearheaded by her GLCs. The success of GLCs in Singapore can be attributed to a number of factors that have been entrenched within the country’s governance system as a result of her historical experience. We argue that any attempt to replicate the Singapore model in other jurisdictions such as China ought to take into account these historical underpinnings, failing which the success of any transplant would not be beyond doubt. History reveals the operation of certain characteristics that are specific to GLCs in Singapore. 84 First , Singapore is a city-state and an international financial centre. While corporate governance measures are shaped by investor preferences, particularly those placed by global financial investors of repute, their enforcement (both public and private) is considerably strong in Singapore. The stellar reputation of Singapore and her companies, whether privately-owned or government-owned, in the overall corporate governance standings in Asia is therefore entirely understandable. \n\nSecond , despite the dominant ownership and control of the government, GLCs are professionally-managed with limited interference from the government. Temasek’s policy is to ensure that independent boards on portfolio companies provide the requisite strategic direction and monitoring so as to benefit shareholders, including the minority shareholders.                    \n\n> 83 For a more detailed discussion of how classic corporate governance theory and the concept of private benefits of control fails to capture the complex reality of controlling shareholders in Asia see, Puchniak, supra note 16.\n> 84 Some of these characteristics are discussed in Isabel Sim, Steen Thomson & GerardYeong, The State as Shareholder: The Case of Singapore , R EPORT PUBLISHED BY THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE OF\n> MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTANTS (CIMA) &CENTRE FOR GOVERNANCE ,INSTITUTIONS AND\n> ORGANISATIONS (CGIO) (June 2014), at 40-41.\n\n24 \n\nThe hands-off approach that is historically evident in GLCs stands in stark contrast to some countries where the government (or in China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)) holds a tight leash over its SOEs and their management and governance. For instance, in Chinese SOEs, decision-making on important matters vests in the hands of the CCP, which it exercises through various mechanisms including by deciding on the appointment and promotion of top SOE executives. 85 While it is true that political legitimacy constitutes the bulwark of strong economic development both in Singapore and China, the manner in which such legitimacy is asserted in the context of SOEs varies significantly in the two countries. While it is indirect and subtle in the Singapore context, it is rather pronounced in China. \n\nThird , the broad themes of public governance in Singapore have also been transposed to its GLCs. Professionalism in management and governance, executive compensation practices that ensure attraction of the best talent and a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption are hallmarks of governance both in Singapore’s public sector as well as its GLCs. Not many countries have achieved the level of talent, effectiveness and efficiency in their public governance to make it a potential asset in the highly competitive global market for corporate governance, which seems to be apparent in the interface between the Singapore government and her GLCs. \n\nFourth , the existence in the 1950s and 1960s of a contested democratic political environment appeared to play a significant role in fostering good political governance in Singapore which was in turn transposed to her GLCs. 86 The PAP was clearly aware of how the Labour Front government lost support as a result of negative public perception brought about partly by allegations of corruption against a member of the cabinet. The PAP therefore sought to cast itself in the 1959 elections as the party of honest and efficient government. Having won convincingly, it had to live up to its promises or risk being punished in subsequent polls. The task was all the more urgent as Lee Kuan Yew and his                  \n\n> 85 Jiangyu Wang, The Political Logic of Corporate Governance in China’s State-owned Enterprises ,(2014) 47 C ORNELL INT ’LL. J. (forthcoming).\n> 86 This is by no means an assertion that democracy is a necessary prerequisite for economic growth. Rather, the fact that Singapore adopted a democratic form of government and the PAP faced a contested political environment were factors that we argue contributed significantly to good governance in Singapore.\n\n25 \n\nallies in the PAP had the communist wing of the Party to contend with which eventually broke away to form the BarisanSosialis. 87 \n\nFifth, the fact that the PAP’s legitimacy is deeply intertwined with Singapore’s economic performance creates a structure in which Temasek has clear incentives to ensure that GLCs are effectively governed for the benefit of all shareholders. This suggests that conventional comparative corporate governance theory, which assumes that controlling shareholders are incentivized primarily to extract private benefits of control, does not seem to apply in full force to Temasek. As such, to understand Temasek and how it exerts controlling power overthe governance of GLCs,requires a uniquely Singaporean lens toilluminate the historical foundations of the principles of economic pragmatism and political stability that have moulded its effective governance. In this article, we began with a discussion of the “convergence” thesis in corporate governance and how the emergence and operation of SOEs detract from that thesis. 88 As we have further sought to establish, the historical evolution of Singapore GLCs and the unique factors of governance they display appear to throw cold water on the convergence argument. On the contrary, there are clear indications of divergence. In that context, our study of the historical evolution of GLCs in Singapore reflects greater sanguinity about the divergence approach towards corporate governance that is supported by the “path dependency” thesis.This suggests that corporate structures and institutions are likely to be shaped very closely by existing structures, which are not amenable to material change due to rent seeking and interest group politics. 89 Moreover, as our study underscores, political 90  \n\n> 87\n\nThe absence of universal suffrage in China is another significant difference from Singapore. However, the historical political cycle in China could act as a proxy. It is a familiar aspect of Chinese history that her dynasties have followed the familiar path of giving way to revolution when the ruler is perceived to have lost the Mandate of Heaven by failing to rule well. There can be no doubt that the leaders of the CCP are aware that if the CCP wishes to remain in power, good governance will have to be strengthened and corruption reduced.  \n\n> 88\n\nHansmann&Kraakman, supra note 2.  \n\n> 89\n\nLucian AryeBebchuk& Mark J.

Rajan & Luigi Zingales, The Great Reversals: 26 \n\nand cultural 91 factors play an important role in shaping corporate governance structures and practices. Having said this, it is entirely possible that over time,Singapore’s dominant form of corporate governance could evolve sufficiently to resemble the market-oriented model of the shareholder-centric corporation. Even so, it is perhaps a fallacy to assume that there is a ‘resting point’ for corporate governance structures. A ‘converged’ system of corporate governance may itself evolve over time into something materially different. While the optimism among Chinese officials to achieve a transplant of Singapore’s successful GLC model into China is comprehensible, as might be the case with other countries exploring this model as a potential one for reform, we caution against its wholesale adoption without regard to the underlying historical factors in Singapore that have been at play. The goal of this article has been to highlight these historical factors with a view to providing some further strands of thought into the convergence-versus-divergence debate. At the same time, we consider this study to be the initial building block for further academic research on Singapore GLCs. Possible further avenues for research include: (i) the precise nature of management and governance structures and mechanisms in GLCs, and how they operate in fact; (ii) comparison between the governance structures and mechanisms between GLCs and privately-owned companies in Singapore; and (iii) comparison between the governance and performance of GLCs and SOEs in other jurisdictions. These will enable a further understanding of the role and impact of SOEs, which continue to be a dominant force in several Asian markets, with their influence extending to other parts of the world. More broadly, it is our hope that these approaches will expand and challenge conventional notions and theories in corporate governance, so as to widen the discourse.                        \n\n> The Politics of Financial Development in the Twentieth Century , 69 J.

CORP .L. 147(2001).\n\n27 \n\nFinally, we should expressly add a caveat about what this article is not about. We do not seek to argue by implication that Singapore should continue to rely on GLCs as major drivers of her economy. While her historical circumstances suggest a strong path dependency towards strong state involvement in the economy, 92 it is and will remain an open question whether this should still be the case or if it is time for the government to further distance itself from the commercial sphere. This continues to be a matter of debate within Singapore. What this article seeks to demonstrate is that Singapore has shown it is possible to have efficient SOEs, and that this was because of her unique experiences and circumstances. \n\n*****\n",

According to the new rules, announced on 29 August 2022, foreigners earning at least SGD30,000 (US$21,450) monthly will be eligible for a five‑year visa under the Overseas Networks and Expertise (ONE) pass, available from January 2023.\n\nThe ONE pass will give holders the flexibility to simultaneously start, operate and work for several firms in Singapore. The pass will also allow their dependents to search for jobs after obtaining a letter of consent. Foreign talent that falls short of the salary threshold, but has outstanding achievements in the arts and culture, science and technology, research and academia, or sports fields, may still be eligible.\n\nTechnology professionals will also be eligible to apply for the five‑year visa from September 2023. Currently, visas for such professionals are only valid for two or three years. To monitor performance, ONE pass holders must report their professional activities annually. Singapore has also reduced the processing time for employment passes, cutting the current three weeks maximum processing time to 10 days.\n\n#### Related

The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) has been slated as a new growth engine in China’s latest plans. It covers the city cluster in the Pearl River Delta area in Southern China, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing in Guangdong province, and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. \n\n2. The establishment of the Central Leading Group on Promoting GBA Development under the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, the top decision-making body for the GBA initiative, not only confirms the strong state endorsement of the GBA, but also reflects the state’s role in coordinating the integrated development of participating cities and overseeing the implementation of the plan. \n\n3. The GBA is characterised by its massive area and population size, far surpassing the Greater Tokyo Bay Area, San Francisco Bay Area and New York Bay Area. The industrial sectors include Hong Kong’s financial and professional services, Shenzhen’s high-technology and innovation, and Guangzhou, Foshan and Dongguan’s electronics, automobile and manufacturing industries. \n\n4. The GBA is one of China’s major national economic centres and the most competitive and market-oriented mega-region that registers rapid manufacturing-driven economic growth with well-linked large-scale inter-city infrastructure; it has become one of the most developed mega-regions in China. \n\n5.  While the comprehensive infrastructure  has laid the foundation for forging close economic ties and regional integration within the GBA, it must align with financial and digital connectivity for it to achieve an efficient cross-border flow of capital and information. Compared to its physical infrastructure, financial and digital connectivity within the GBA is underdeveloped. \n\n6. In February 2019, two priority areas, namely, innovation in technology and the financial sector, were highlighted in the Outline Development Plan for the ii \n\nGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (the Plan henceforth). The Plan provides specific policy measures to support activities for indigenous innovation and homegrown technologies by research institutions and firms in the GBA cities. \n\n7. China is seeking to be self-sufficient in advanced technology and high-tech products, and take the lead in the world in a range of high-tech sectors, from the fifth-generation communication networking, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles to big data and internet of things. The Chinese government has set the ambitious goal of becoming a global leader in innovation by 2035. \n\n8. Shenzhen will play a leading role in this pursuit. Once a small fishing village, it has emerged as a leading national centre for innovation and scientific research with growing global influence. In 2019, while national spending on research and development (R&D) was 2.19%, Shenzhen’s R&D expenditure accounted for 4.3% of the regional GDP, outstripping that of all other cities in China. \n\n9. Unlike other renowned Bay Areas in the world, the GBA has the most complex governance structure. Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau have separate political systems and custom zones with hard borders, different institutional, legal and taxation collection systems, and distinct governance culture. \n\n10. This complexity in governance structure, legal systems and currencies in the GBA itself speaks for the very challenging task faced by the Chinese central and local authorities in their push for cross-border economic integration across GBA cities. 1\n\n## THE GUANGDONG-HONG KONG-MACAU GREATER BAY AREA: AN UPDATE \n\nYU Hong ∗\n\nThe Greater Bay Area in Comparative Perspective \n\n1.1  China has earmarked the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) as a new growth engine for its pursuit of sustainable national economic growth in the face of external hostility. The city cluster surrounding the Pearl River Delta area in Southern China, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing in Guangdong province, and the two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau made up the GBA (see Map for their location). \n\nMAP LOCATION OF GBA IN CHINA  \n\n> Source: Author’s own compilation.\n> ∗Yu Hong is Senior Research Fellow at the East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore.\n\n2\n\n1.2  These 11 cities are highly connected socially and economically, with links to the cross-city infrastructure network. Around 67 million people reside within the 56,000 square kilometres of land area. The cultural affiliation and geographical proximity have facilitated decades-long economic cooperation among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau. The GBA evidently is already well developed. According to a ranking of the world’s 100 most economically competitive cities (Table 1), Shenzhen was the highest-ranking Chinese city in 2019. Three other GBA cities, Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Foshan, also made it to the top 100. \n\nTABLE 1 CHINESE CITIES RANKED GLOBALLY AS AMONG \n\nTHE 100 MOST ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE CITIES, 2019           \n\n> Source: UN-Habitat and Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, “Global Urban Competitiveness Report (2019-2020)”, pp. 1-31, available at https://unhabitat.org/sites/ default/files/2020/10/global_urban_competitiveness_report_2019-2020_the_world_300_years _of_transformation_into_city.pdf , accessed 4 December 2020.\n\n1.3  The GBA has three distinguishing features. First, it is the largest bay area by size and the one with the largest population. Both its size and population surpass those of the Greater Tokyo Bay Area, San Francisco Bay Area and New York Bay Area. Second, the GBA’s strength lies in its wide spectrum of industrial sectors located in the different cities, such as financial and other professional services in Hong Kong, high-technology and innovation in Shenzhen, and electronics, automobile and other manufacturing industries in Guangzhou, Foshan and Dongguan. Each city has its own economic strengths and unique competitiveness.                     \n\n> Chinese City Global Ranking\n> Shenzhen 4\n> Shanghai 10\n> Hong Kong 13\n> Beijing 17\n> Guangzhou 18\n> Suzhou 25\n> Nanjing 42\n> Wuhan 43\n> Chengdu 54\n> Hangzhou 64\n> Wuxi 65\n> Changsha 68\n> Qingdao 76\n> Chongqing 81\n> Tianjin 82\n> Foshan 84\n> Ningbo 90\n> Zhengzhou 94\n> Changzhou 99\n\n3\n\n1.4  Third, in 2017, the combined container handling capacity, recorded as 66.33 million tons of TEUs, of the three core ports within the GBA (Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Guangzhou) exceeded the combined corresponding figures of ports of other major bay areas in the world. The prosperity of the bay area’s export-oriented industries and the region’s economic clout are reflected in the competitive strength of this group of container ports. 1\n\n1.5  The GBA is one of China’s major national economic centres that registers rapid manufacturing-driven economic growth and well-linked large-scale inter-city infrastructure; it has become one of the most developed mega-regions in China and locals in this region enjoy incomes that are now on par with those in developed nations. \n\n1.6  Although the GBA accounts for less than one per cent of China’s territorial size and five per cent of its population, it contributed over 12% of China’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. The GBA is one of the most internationalised regions in the country in terms of its ratio of foreign trade to GDP and inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI). The GBA had attracted substantial FDI inflow to China, some US$91.8 billion in 2019 (see Table 2 for details). \n\n1.7  The fast expansion of cross-boundary infrastructure connectivity throughout GBA cities, concurrently linked by high-speed railway, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau sea bridge and other forms of infrastructure, is a factor for the more efficient movement of professionals, capital and information across the region.  The comprehensive infrastructure  has laid the foundation for forging close economic ties and regional integration within the GBA. A string of new infrastructure projects is also being constructed or in the pipeline in various GBA cities (Appendix 1). The completed and planned cross-border transportation projects will reduce travel time between GBA cities, and provide more travel mode options for residents, tourists and businesspersons.    \n\n> 1Yu Hong, “The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area in the Making: development plans and challenge”, Cambridge Review of International Affairs ,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/ 10.1080/ 09557571.2019.1679719 , accessed 8 March 2021.\n\n4\n\nTABLE 2 KEY DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS OF GBA CITIES, 2019 \n\nCity \n\nResidential population (in million) \n\nLand area (sq km) \n\nGDP (RMB in billion) \n\nGDP per capita (US$) \n\nPercentage of high-tech manufacturing in total value-added industrial output \n\nPercentage of tertiary industry in regional GDP \n\nRatio of foreign trade to GDP (%) \n\nForeign direct investment \n\n(US$100 million) \n\nPercentage of research and development (R&D) expenditure in regional GDP \n\nAverage property price (RMB in thousands per square metre) \n\nZhuhai  2.02  1,732  343.5  25,400  29.6  53.8  84.6  24.2  2.5  21,000 \n\nGuangzhou  15.30  7,434  2362.8  22,600  49.0  71.6  42.3  71.4  2.4  22,000 \n\nShenzhen  13.02  1,997  2422.1  28,600  61.5  58.8  123.7  82.0  4.3  58,000 \n\nFoshan  8.15  3,798  1075.1  19,100  6.2  42.3  44.9  7.0  2.3  17,000 \n\nDongguan  8.46  2,460  948.2  16,300  19.8  43.2  145.5  12.0  2.6  19,000 \n\nZhongshan  3.38  1,784  310.1  13,400  n.a  48.9  76.9  5.5  2.2  10,000 \n\nZhaoqing  4.18  14,891  224.8  7,795  9.5  41.7  17.9  1.4  1.2  7,000 \n\nJiangmen  4.63  9,509  314.6  9,855  11.0  48.9  45.2  8.2  2.0  7,000 \n\nHuizhou  4.88  11,346  417.7  12,400  41.7  43.2  64.8  9.3  2.1  9,000 \n\nHong Kong  7.50  1,106  2415.4  48,114  n.a.  93.5  300.0  683.7  0.8  140,000 \n\nMacau  0.68  32.9  356.3  79,977  n.a.  97.5  2.9  3.3  n.a.  85,000     \n\n> Notes: statistical figures on the average property price and R&D expenditure of various cities were based on 2017 data.\n> Sources: calculations based on various updated information, including 2019 National Economic and Social Development Statistical Bulletin for various mainland cities located in the GBA; Ernst and Young, 2019; Yearbook of Statistics , Macau 2019; and Hong Kong Annual Digest of Statistics 2020.\n\n5\n\n1.8  Nevertheless, physical infrastructure connectivity must align with financial and digital connectivity in order to achieve an efficient cross-border flow of capital and information. Compared to the physical infrastructure, financial and digital connectivity within the GBA is underdeveloped. Customs declaration of goods is still largely paper-based. There is no centralised database to allow banks and firms across the GBA cities to share their customers’ credit reports and collaterals. 2\n\nRationale behind State’s Push for the GBA \n\n2.1  The Chinese central government officially endorsed the GBA development initiative for the first time in 2016. 3 In September 2017, China’s President Xi Jinping reiterated the Chinese government’s determination to develop the GBA in his speech at the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. 4\n\n2.2  The establishment of the Central Leading Group on Promoting GBA Development under the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, 5 the top decision-making body for overseeing the GBA development initiative, reflects the state’s not only strong endorsement of the GBA, but also forceful role in coordinating the integrated development of the participating cities and overseeing the implementation of the plan. \n\n2.3  The Chinese government’s determination to promote GBA development is driven by both external and internal factors. China has to respond fast to massive changes in the global geopolitical landscape, such as the intensifying China-US                      \n\n> 2Deloitte, “FinTech Strategy: For the Greater Bay Area in China”, 2019, pp. 1-14, available at\n> https://www2.deloitte.com/cn/en/pages/financial-services/articles/fintech-strategy-for-the-greater-bay-area-in-china.html , accessed 10 March 2021.\n> 3“China’s 13th Five-Year Plan 2016-2020” issued in 2016 stated China’s intention to develop the GBA.\n> 4Xi Jinping, “Zai zhongguo gongchandang dishijiuci quanguo dabiaodahui shangde baogao”,\n> Xinhua News ,18 October 2017, available at http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/19cpcnc/2017-10/ 27/c_1121867529.htm , accessed 22 August 2018.\n> 5Han Zheng, China’s executive vice-premier, serves as the chair for this central leading group, while other members include Ma Xingrui, governor of Guangdong province, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive and Ho Lat Seng, Macau’s chief executive. The role of this leading group is to formulate policies and development plans related to the GBA and coordinate major affairs among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, such as cross-boundary infrastructure construction and operation, economic and industrial development planning, social welfare and environmental protection.\n\n6\n\ncompetition and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, which are likely to hasten the restructuring of global supply and value chains. The shift to a “dual (domestic and international) circulation” strategy necessitates the making of a city cluster in the GBA that could help strengthen the country’s competitiveness in regional and global competition. \n\n2.4  Beijing’s push for the GBA development plan could also be partly driven by the need to align Hong Kong closer to the Mainland, economically as well as socially, to put local pro-independence movement at bay. To this end, several major cooperation platforms and demonstration centres have been established to advance the integration of Hong Kong and Macau with nine mainland Chinese cities involved, including Qianhai in Shenzhen, Nansha in Guangzhou, Hengqin in Zhuhai, Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park in Shenzhen, Daguang Bay Economic Zone in Jiangmen and Guangdong-Macau Comprehensive Cooperation Demonstration Zone in Zhongshan. \n\n2.5  To encourage and support young Hong Kongers to work and pursue their career in the mainland cities of the GBA, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam in her 2020 Policy Address announced the launch of the GBA Youth Employment Scheme to provide 2,000 new jobs. Although this scheme aims to encourage private firms with operations in both Hong Kong and mainland cities to recruit local Hong Kong university graduates to work in GBA cities, it has failed in its appeal to young Hong Kongers mainly due to the substantial salary gaps between Hong Kong and mainland cities, as well as concerns about differences in institutions and living and working environment. \n\n2.6  The need for regional integration is well recognised amongst GBA cities given the fierce competition from other regions at home and abroad. Current challenges faced by the nine cities include rising land and labour costs, deteriorating environmental pollution, fierce inter-city competition, and land and skilled labour shortages. The Guangdong government would have to promote closer inter-city cooperation under the GBA development plan and leverage the international business expertise of Hong Kong and Macau to overcome these obstacles. Local 7\n\nindustrial upgrading and economic restructuring will be accelerated through the implementation of the GBA plan. \n\n2.7  The state-led plan for the GBA is a long-term strategy to sustain national economic development that could become a model in the modernisation drive of China.  6 The Chinese central government has great faith in the cities’ various competitive advantages in its transformation of the GBA into a world-class city cluster by 2030. \n\n2.8  Under the coordination of the Chinese central government, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and Guangdong provincial government, in cooperation with the Hong Kong and Macau SAR governments, have drawn up an ambitious GBA development plan. In February 2019, the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (referred to as the GBA development plan or the plan) was announced. \n\n2.9  Significantly, two priority areas have been highlighted in the state’s agenda for the GBA, namely, innovation in technology and the financial sector. Nurturing indigenous innovation capacity and developing the financial sector are identified as the new drivers of economic growth for the GBA. \n\n2.10  The plan stipulates the strategic positioning of every involved city and outlined broad mid- to long-term development objectives for the GBA (Table 3). A clearer division of labour will facilitate synergies among different GBA cities specialising in different industrial sectors and provide a conduit of spill-over effects to boost total factor productivity (TFP) growth. The 62-page plan serves as the guiding document outlining the key priority areas for collaboration and cooperation among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.               \n\n> 6“Guo Shuqing, Chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, Delivered aTelevised Speech to the 14th Asian Financial Forum”, 18 January 2021, available at\n> https://finance.sina.cn/bank/yhgd/2021-01-18/detail-ikftpnnx8837950.d.html?from=wap , accessed 24 January 2021.\n\n8\n\nTABLE 3 DESIGNATED ROLES OF GBA CITIES \n\nCity  GBA Development Plan \n\nHong Kong  Core city, international financial centre, international hub for shipping, aviation, trade, offshore RMB and asset management \n\nMacau  Core city, international tourism and leisure centre, and a trading hub between China and Portuguese-speaking countries \n\nGuangzhou  Core city, a leading state-level city, an economic hub, and an international hub for commerce, transportation, culture and education \n\nShenzhen  Core city, national economic centre, and an international hub for technology and innovation \n\nFoshan  High-end manufacturing and high-tech manufacturing hub \n\nDongguan  High-end manufacturing centre for electronic equipment and information technology, and an incubator for new strategic industries \n\nHuizhou  Important state-level base for manufacturing and clean energy production \n\nZhuhai  Advanced equipment manufacturing hub and bio-pharmaceutical hub \n\nJiangmen  An energy conservation and environmental protection industry centre \n\nZhongshan  Specialising in manufacturing, food and beverage, and high-end equipment \n\nZhaoqing  Manufacturing base for green agricultural products \n\n> Source: Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.\n\nInnovation in Technology \n\n3.1  For years, economic growth in the GBA has been heavily driven by extensive growth in input factors including cheap labour, capital accumulation and infrastructure investment. Given rising production costs and diminishing returns on capital formation, this growth model is no longer sustainable. 7 Productivity growth driven by technological innovation has yet to play an important role in the GBA’s economic development. As part of the “dual circulation strategy”, the Chinese state is pushing for technological self-sufficiency, especially in key high-tech commodities such as semiconductors and computer chips. \n\n3.2  To forestall “foreign chokehold” on China’s technological industries, China aims to promote indigenous innovation and homegrown technologies as China’s previous drivers of economic growth, such as infrastructure investment, cheap land and labour costs, and demographic dividends, have largely run their course. 8 The plan has provided several specific policy measures and initiatives to support activities for indigenous innovation and homegrown technologies conducted by               \n\n> 7Can Huang and Naubahar Sharif, “Manufacturing Dynamics and Spillovers: The Case of Guangdong Province and Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan”, Research Policy , vol. 38, Issue 5, 2009, pp. 813-828.\n> 8World Bank and Development Research Centre of China, “Innovative China: New Drivers of Growth”, 2019, pp. 1-150.\n\n9\n\nresearch institutions and firms located in GBA cities. A World Bank Report published in December 2020  9 points out that China will need to develop city clusters and new growth poles in the coastal provinces in order to develop an economy driven by innovation and a thriving service sector. \n\n3.3  Leveraging each city’s strengths and advantages, the intention is for the GBA to be transformed into a key hub for technological innovation for the country as well as the world. Instead of relying on suppliers of advanced technology and high-tech products, China aims to promote indigenous innovation and take the lead in the world in a range of high-tech sectors, from fifth-generation communication networking, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles to big data and internet of things. The Chinese government has set the ambitious goal of becoming the global leader in innovation by 2035. \n\n3.4  Boosting productivity  10  in GBA cities through the development of advanced technology and innovation is crucial for the region’s growth prospects. As shown in Figure 1, the innovation capacity of mainland GBA cities has improved during the past few years as reflected in the numbers of patent applications and patents for inventions granted in Guangdong. \n\n3.5  At the core of this drive to develop technology and innovation in the GBA will be the city of Shenzhen. Once a small fishing village, it has emerged as a leading national centre for innovation and scientific research with growing global influence. Its diversified market economy and open commercial environment, innovative companies and strong manufacturing sector underscore Shenzhen’s attractiveness and competitiveness. It is also home to many of China’s top tech companies, including Huawei, Tencent, BYD, DJI and BGI Group.

TFP growth depends on four key components, namely, physical capital (infrastructure and production facilities readiness), human capital quality (quality of education and health care, and skill training for the workers), business environment (legal and dispute settlement framework, governance efficiency and transparency) and technology development (indigenous innovation, application and diffusion of technology across regions). These components in combination are key to boosting productivity growth.\n\n10 \n\neconomy, biotechnology and new materials; in 2019, high-tech industries accounted for 61.5% of China’s industrial value-added output.           \n\n> 2.21 2.00 2.22\n> 3.34\n> 3.86\n> 4.57\n> 5.33 5.97\n> 0.00\n> 5.00\n> 10.00\n> 15.00\n> 20.00\n> 25.00\n> 30.00\n> 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n> Thousand '000\n\nFIGURE 1 NUMBER OF INVENTION PATENT APPLICATIONS AND \n\nINVENTION PATENTS GRANTED IN GUANGDONG  \n\n> Number of invention patent applications Number of invention patents granted\n> Source: Statistical Bureau of Guangdong province.\n\n3.6  In 2019, Shenzhen had outpaced national spending on research and development (R&D) of 2.19% of the national GDP; its R&D expenditure accounted for 4.3% of the regional GDP (Table 2) and outstripped that of all other cities in China. This reflects Shenzhen’s commitment to take a lead nationally in technology and innovation, and to become an international innovation hub in the years leading up to 2025, the stipulated deadline in the plan. \n\n3.7 Shenzhen accounts for 2.7% of China’s total economy and 9.4% of its external trade; in 2019, its per capita GDP was US$28,600, almost three times the national figure. Shenzhen is like a microcosm of China’s reform and opening up process. It took just 40 years to develop from a small, isolated fishing village to become one of the most innovative and vibrant modern cities in China. It holds an important strategic position in China’s regional development; how it performs will generate a 11 \n\nripple effect on China’s economy, particularly in the GBA where it accounts for at least 20% of economic volume and is a key driver of growth in the area. 11 \n\n3.8  The inflow of talents to GBA cities is essential for developing high-tech industries and enhancing TFP growth. However, Shenzhen needs to nurture a creative local culture by devoting more resources to education and research institutions supporting basic research if it is to be at the forefront of innovation. It lacks scientists in fundamental research and its universities are far behind foreign universities in terms of research capability. Local Shenzhen universities are therefore unable to cope with the important task of cultivating talents and building a research innovation platform. These deficiencies are a bane to Shenzhen’s capacity to take a lead in the field of technological innovation. \n\n3.9  To meet this challenge, the Shenzhen authority has rolled out various preferential policies (e.g. funding, taxation, scientific innovation and human talent attraction) in recent years to promote research collaboration among local universities in Shenzhen, leading mainland universities and universities in Hong Kong (e.g. Chinese University of Hong Kong). Leading domestic universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University and Sun Yat-Sen University, are encouraged to build campuses or set up joint research facilities in Shenzhen. \n\n3.10  As outlined in the State’s Plan for Developing Shenzhen into the Pilot Demonstration Area for Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, the Chinese authorities will grant more autonomy to Shenzhen for it to attract foreign talents by streamlining work visa rules and granting permanent Chinese residence status to qualified foreign talents. \n\n3.11  To further enhance the indigenous innovation capability of Shenzhen, China’s version of a “Silicon Valley”, the Chinese authority has rolled out a string of preferential policies to boost innovation and support local technological start-ups       \n\n> 11 Yu Hong, “Xi’s Five-Year Plan for Shenzhen: A Hard Road Ahead?” ThinkChina, 16 October 2020, available at https://www.thinkchina.sg/xis-five-year-plan-shenzhen-hard-road-ahead ,accessed 5December 2020.\n\n12 \n\nand big tech firms. 12  In October 2020, the Chinese government announced a five-year plan to develop Shenzhen into a “pilot demonstration area for socialism with Chinese characteristics”, once again bringing the city into the limelight. The Chinese government will give Shenzhen the authority to implement test reforms in multiple areas rather than individual areas. \n\n3.12  Based on China’s negative lists for foreign investment, the Chinese government will work out a similar list for Shenzhen, but with a lower threshold for entering the Shenzhen market so as to build a more equal market environment that allows fair competition between domestic and foreign companies. Despite the hostile external environment and barriers to technological cooperation and restrictions on imports of core technology imposed by the United States and other Western countries, forging close international innovation collaboration between GBA cities and other countries will be essential for boosting the TFP of local industries and developing high-tech industries and the innovation economy in the GBA. \n\n3.13  The drive to reduce dependence on foreign technology, and strengthen domestic innovation and the intellectual property protection regime, as well as promote international collaboration on technological innovation reflects China’s ambition to further develop indigenous innovation capacity within the GBA, with a focus on technology and innovation as key engines for economic growth in the GBA. \n\n3.14  Shenzhen is slated to be the most open city with the best business environment in China. It is to serve as an important node in China’s large domestic cycle and as the country’s fulcrum in its “dual circulation” strategy as Shenzhen leverages its position in the international cycle. 13 \n\n3.15  According to the timeline, Shenzhen has to complete its reforms within five years, an indication of the ambitions of China’s leaders in developing Shenzhen into a           \n\n> 12 The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council of China, “Shenzhen jianshe zhongguo tese shehuizhuyi xianxingshifanqu zonghegaige shidian fang’an (2020-2025)” (Plan for Implementing Pilot Reforms in Shenzhen to build the City into a Demonstration Area of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics), 11 October 2020, available at http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/2020-10/11/ content_5550408.htm , accessed 4 December 2020.\n> 13 Yu Hong, “Xi’s Five-Year Plan for Shenzhen: A Hard Road Ahead?”\n\n13 \n\nmodel for China’s development. However, the document was short on details, such as the mechanisms these sectors should adopt to lower their thresholds and further open to foreign investments. \n\n3.16  Shenzhen’s key strengths lie in its electronic communications and other high-tech industries. Yet these industries have been impacted by US restrictions on these technologies and products. Tech companies in Shenzhen, such as Huawei, Tencent, BGI Group and DJI, have also been sanctioned and placed on the US Department of Commerce’s Entity List. The five-year plan did not mention how Shenzhen can cushion itself from such impacts and from the intense China-US competition, especially in terms of tech decoupling. \n\n3.17  The absence of a strong intellectual property protection regime has also discouraged both domestic and foreign private investment in innovation and R&D; foreign companies are particularly reluctant to develop frontier technology or transfer advanced technology to Shenzhen or other GBA cities. Shenzhen therefore needs to do more to strengthen protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. \n\nPromoting Inter-City Financial Connectivity \n\n4.1 Cross-border financial connectivity serves as a new platform for pursuing strong economic linkages between the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macau.  The Chinese state expects the financial industry to play an important role during the transformation of the GBA from a manufacturing-based to a service sector-driven economy. \n\n4.2  The GBA houses some of China’s most important financial hubs: Hong Kong is an established international financial centre and Shenzhen, as the home of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and many leading high-tech and fin-tech firms, is an emerging national financial centre. The 2020 Global Financial Centre Index of competitiveness of the world’s major financial centres ranked Hong Kong, 14 \n\nShenzhen and Guangzhou, the three GBA cities, among the top 20 financial centres in a pool of 108 14  (Table 4). \n\nTABLE 4 GFCI 27 TOP 20 RANKINGS AND RATINGS \n\nFinancial \n\nCentre \n\nGFCI 27  GFCI 26 \n\nChange in Rank  Change in Rating Rank  Rating  Rank  Rating \n\nNew York  1 769  1 790  0 -21 \n\nLondon  2 742  2 773  0 -31 \n\nTokyo  3 741  6 757  +3  -16 \n\nShanghai  4 740  5 761  +1  -21 \n\nSingapore  5 738  4 762  -1  -24 \n\nHong Kong  6 737  3 771  -3  -34 \n\nBeijing  7 734  7 748  0 -14 \n\nSan Francisco  8 732  12  736  +4  -4 \n\nGeneva  9 729  26  706  +17  +23 \n\nLos Angeles  10  723  13  735  +3  -12 \n\nShenzhen  11  722  9 739  -2  -17 \n\nDubai  12  721  8 740  -4  -19 \n\nFrankfurt  13  720  15  733  +2  -13 \n\nZurich  14  719  14  734  0 -15 \n\nParis  15  718  17  728  +2  -10 \n\nChicago  16  717  16  732  0 -15 \n\nEdinburgh  17  716  29  701  +12  +15 \n\nLuxembourg  18  715  25  708  +7  +7 \n\nGuangzhou  19  714  23  711  _+4  +3 \n\nSydney  20  713  10  738  -10  -25 \n\nSource:  Z/Yen and China Development Institute, “The Global Financial Centres Index 27”, March 2020, pp. 1-55. \n\n4.3  However, there is a lack of financial integration between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau in the banking and securities sectors in particular. Various barriers (e.g. legal and regulatory issues) impede free flow of services and capital across cities in the GBA. 15  As unveiled in the state plan, Beijing seeks to accelerate cross-border financial connectivity in order to foster stronger bonds between the financial markets of the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macau. 16  Great impetus to the region’s financial sector would be provided through developing strong linkage  \n\n> 14\n\nThe 2020 Global Financial Centre Index based its ranking on five broad areas of competitiveness, comprising institutional and regulatory environment, depth and breadth of industry clusters, availability of capital, market liquidity and economic output.  \n\n> 15\n\nGoldman Sachs, “Assessing the Economic Integration of China’s Greater Bay Area”, Asia Economics Analyst , 10 February 2021, pp. 1-22.  \n\n> 16\n\nYu Hong, “China’s Plan for Promoting Financial Connectivity within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area”, EAI Background Brief , no. 1550, East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore. 15 \n\nwith other business and financial centres (e.g. London and Singapore), and fostering financial business clusters that would promote greater efficiency. \n\n4.4  The Chinese financial regulators unveiled a plan titled “Opinions Concerning Financial Support for the Establishment of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area” 17  in May 2020. The Plan presented by four central financial regulators aims to promote holistic and coordinated financial development across the GBA.  The state-driven plan could kick-start the GBA’s journey towards greater financial connectivity of infrastructure, markets and products across Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.  The Plan detailed 26 measures, focusing on five particular policy areas. 18 \n\n4.5  These policy measures will liberalise China’s tight control of foreign exchange and foreign currency remittance to boost cross-border capital flows across the GBA. Of the five policy areas highlighted in Appendix 2, opening up of the financial service sector across the GBA and promoting inter-city connectivity of financial infrastructure and products are the two priority areas in Beijing’s agenda for implementing the plan. This will allow qualified Hong Kong and Macau financial institutions and non-financial firms, for instance, to issue financial bonds, corporate bonds and debt financing instruments on the Mainland via their branches in the GBA.  Financial firms and professionals based in the GBA could also capitalise on the new business opportunities arising from the insurance sector, electronic payment systems, wealth management connect pilot scheme, carbon emission trading and other green financial products, securities and private domestic funds. \n\n4.6 Financial institutions in Hong Kong stand to gain most from the state plan of financial connectivity within the GBA through the further opening up of the              \n\n> 17 “Opinions Concerning Financial Support for the Establishment of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area”, 14 May 2020, available at http://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/policy/policy% 20release/policies/content/post_258474.html , accessed 16 June 2020.\n> 18 These five policy areas consist of expediting cross-border trade and investment and financial convenience in the GBA, expanding the openness of the financial sector, providing more investment opportunities for Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau residents, expediting the connection of financial markets and financial infrastructure, raising the innovation level within financial services sector of the GBA ,and pragmatically presenting cross-border financial risk.\n\n16 \n\nfinancial sector in Guangdong. They could either set up new operational branches or expand their existing operations in the GBA. Hong Kong’s insurance companies could also benefit from the new business opportunities brought about by cross-border motor vehicle, medical and RMB reinsurance businesses. \n\n4.7  When fully implemented, it will facilitate access of Hong Kong-based and Guangdong-based investors to each other’s financial markets and widen cross-border investments flow between the Mainland and Hong Kong, thereby strengthening the competitiveness of the GBA’s wealth management and asset businesses in the international arena. \n\n4.8 The implementation of these  financial policy measures will likely be gradual and cautious to ensure national financial stability and curb capital flight. At the initial stage, a limited range of financial products and qualified institutions will be made available for sales to gain experience before the full opening up of the financial markets is permitted on the Mainland. \n\n4.9  The Chinese government has earmarked the financial and fintech industries in the two core cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou for support, a reason for the ambitious target of over 70% of GDP from the GBA (including Hong Kong and Macau) deriving from these industries by 2030. \n\n4.10  There is also a need to nurture a high-quality regulatory environment and legal system for the financial industry and international financial centre to thrive. Hong Kong will likely be a role model for financial development, offering lessons to Shenzhen and Guangzhou. The Chinese government seeks to shore up the financial sector of mainland GBA by capitalising on the strengths of Hong Kong as an established international financial centre with a sound regulatory regime and a superior legal framework. 19  Given Hong Kong’s status as a major international financial centre, it could provide the much-needed capital to enhance R&D expenditure and accelerate industrial upgrading and research capability in the GBA.  \n\n> 19 Yu Hong, “China’s Plan for Promoting Financial Connectivity”.\n\n17 \n\n4.11  Since the handover of sovereignty to China in 1997, Hong Kong’s economy has gradually become more integrated with that of the Mainland.  The mainland factor has subsequently played an increasingly important role in Hong Kong’s financial industry. Currently, more than 1,200 mainland enterprises are listed in Hong Kong (H-Share companies), with a combined market capitalisation of HK$27.9 trillion. In 2019, mainland enterprises accounted for over 50% of companies listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. These listed mainland firms represented 73% of the total market capitalisation in Hong Kong (HK$38 trillion) in 2019.  20  With Beijing’s blessing, offshore RMB business was launched in Hong Kong in 2004. Hong Kong has since become a global hub for offshore RMB business,  accounting for  the world’s largest RMB liquidity pool outside mainland China and offering the widest range of offshore RMB wealth management and other investment products. \n\n4.12  Compared to domestic financial centres in mainland China, Hong Kong still enjoys competitive advantages, albeit with a narrowing gap. It has internationally active financial markets and offers comprehensive and sophisticated financial and professional services. The financial industry is the mainstay of the Hong Kong economy, contributing 20% to its GDP in 2018. Mainland GBA still has a predominantly manufacturing-driven economy and an underdeveloped financial industry. The services sector accounts for barely 57% of GDP in mainland GBA. The share of Guangdong’s financial sector was eight per cent of its GDP in 2017, an increase of four per cent from that in 2007. 21 \n\nIssues and Challenges \n\n5.1  This round of integrated regional development is only one in the series of regional development plans for the GBA. The Chinese government’s call for coordinated regional development across the Pearl River Delta cities began in the      \n\n> 20 Hong Kong Stock Exchange, “HKEX Market Statistics 2019”, April 2020, pp. 1-15, available at https://www.hkex.com.hk/-/media/HKEX-Market/Market-Data/Statistics/Consolidated-Reports/Annual-Market-Statistics/2019-Market-Statistics.pdf , accessed 3 June 2020.\n> 21 Data source: Statistical Yearbook of Guangdong , various years.\n\n18 \n\nearly 1990s. 22  Subsequently in 2008, the central government issued the “Reform and Development Plan for the Pearl River Delta Region 2008-2020” to forge another round of regional integration in the Bay Area,  23  with little concrete progress. \n\n5.2  First, the GBA has the most complex governance structure unlike other renowned Bay Areas in the world. Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau have separate political systems and custom zones with hard borders, different institutional, legal and taxation collection systems, and distinct governance culture. 24  It uses three different currencies, namely, the Hong Kong dollar, renminbi and Macau Pataca. Some scholars refer to the PRD as a “highly fragmented mega-city region in China”. 25  This complexity in governance structure, legal systems and currencies in the GBA is stark testimony to the very challenging task faced by the Chinese central and local authorities in their push for cross-border economic integration across GBA cities. \n\n5.3  Local and foreign financial enterprises operating in the GBA will both have to follow different regulatory regimes and comply with different financial rules in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau. The compliance costs are high and, more importantly, the effect on business efficiency could be serious. \n\n5.4  Second, the GBA’s uniqueness is derived from the influence of its three leading or core cities, namely, Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, which have been allocated exceptional economic, industrial and political resources over and above those of other cities within the GBA. However, economically, having three core cities to spearhead regional cooperation is almost an unknown in other major bay areas in the world.        \n\n> 22 Peter Cheung TY, “The Guangdong Advantage: Provincial Leadership and Strategy toward Resource Allocation since 1979” in Peter TY Cheung, Jae Ho Chung and Lin Zhimin (eds), Provincial Strategies of Economic Reform in Post-Mao China , New York, M E Sharpe, 1998, pp. 89–144.\n> 23 Li Zhigang, Jiang Xu and Anthony Yeh G O “State Rescaling and the Making of City-Regions in the Pearl River Delta, China”, Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy , vol. 32, Issue 1, 2014, pp. 129–43.\n> 24 Yu Hong, “The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area in the Making”.\n> 25 Jiang Xu and Anthony G O Yeh, “Re-Building Regulation and Re-Inventing Governance in the Pearl River Delta, China”, Urban Policy and Research , vol. 30, no. 4, 2012, pp. 385–401.\n\n19 \n\n5.5  The three core cities are expected to play a leading and not participatory role in the further development of the GBA. As every city government in the GBA has its own development interests, agenda and development strategy for boosting financial development and economic growth, it will complicate the pursuit of inter-regional policy coordination that is essential for achieving regional economic integration within the GBA. Since the city governments have formed their own calculations and views on the development plan for GBA, it will take Beijing time to consider and accommodate the demands and views of the various cities involved. \n\n5.6  Hong Kong’s coastal location, premium infrastructure facilities, efficient governance, free market economy and global business network have contributed to its economic success as one of the most competitive cities in the world. While its reputation as an established international financial centre and attractive destination to do business took time to build, it could be destroyed easily; the persistent social unrest and violence have already taken their toll on the viability of its financial system. Nevertheless, the social unrest and street violence have subsided considerably due to the implementation of the national security law in Hong Kong as well as the strict safety measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020. \n\n5.7  China’s integration with the global economy and increasingly globalised outlook (an example is the Belt and Road Initiative) has put Hong Kong’s long-held middleman role in question. Hong Kong will now have to forge further collaboration with mainland China and neighbouring cities within the GBA in particular to strengthen its competitive advantages and status as an international trading and financial centre. Hong Kong-based companies would have to take advantage of regional integration to penetrate the mainland Chinese market to ensure the prosperity and sustainability of Hong Kong’s economic development. 26 \n\n5.8 However, Hong Kong’s free flow of capital, convertible currency, ease of doing business, prudent regulatory framework and sound legal system means that it still leads as a financial hub. Given Hong Kong’s sophistication in financial  \n\n> 26 Yu Hong, “The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area in the Making”.\n\n20 \n\ndevelopment, variety of financial products and pool of available financial professionals, Shenzhen is unlikely to replace Hong Kong as an internationally recognised financial hub in the foreseeable future. 27 \n\n5.9 Third , Hongkongers’ resistance to economic integration between Hong Kong and the Mainland in the recent years due to an erosion of trust in the Mainland’s commitment to the “One Country, Two Systems” principles has intensified tensions between the Mainland and Hong Kong and polarised Hong Kong society. The sharply divided views on the GBA within Hong Kong reflect the ambivalence of Hongkongers towards integration with mainland China since the handover of Hong Kong to China back in 1997. 28 \n\n5.10  Guangdong’s provincial and municipal authorities have been offering various incentives, such as granting work permits and tax breaks and allowing Hong Kong residents to purchase properties in the Mainland, to attract Hongkongers, particularly the younger generation, to relocate to the nine mainland cities. \n\nAlthough Beijing plans to bind Hong Kong more closely to mainland China, many Hongkongers have no desire to live or work in the neighbouring city of Shenzhen, let alone other mainland cities; they view mainland cities, including Shenzhen, as corrupt and lacking in liberties such as the rule of law and freedom of speech. 29 \n\n5.11 Many  Hongkongers , the young generation in particular, have yet to buy into the state-led GBA development plan.  Implementation of the GBA plan has been sluggish since its inception in 2018 and particularly since the massive and persistent anti-government protests erupted in Hong Kong in June 2019. Moreover, the coronavirus outbreak that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan has                      \n\n> 27 Yu Hong, “Financial Connectivity within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and Hong Kong as a Financial Hub”, EAI Background Brief , No. 1551, East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore.\n> 28 Yew Chiew Ping and Kwong Kin-Ming, “Hong Kong Identity on the Rise”, Asian Survey , vol. 54, no. 6, 2014, pp. 1088–112; and Yu Hong, Kwong Kin-Ming and Yew Chiew Ping, “Hong Kong in China: 15 Years after Handover”, EAI Background Brief , no. 744, East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore, 2012.\n> 29 Bloomberg, “Hong Kong versus Shenzhen: Two Competing Visions of China’s Future”, available at https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2019-hk-v-shenzhen/ , accessed 1 July 2020.

To many Hong Kongers, the initial failure to control the virus transmission in Wuhan and the subsequent cover-up of the pandemic outbreak reflect the lack of freedom of speech in mainland China and the inherent weakness of Chinese institutions.  The cross-border transport restrictions due to the pandemic have also limited the flow of people between Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland cities, thereby creating a new barrier to the state-driven plan to integrate Hong Kong with the wider GBA. According to a survey,  30  the virus has enhanced the reluctance of many Hongkongers to take up jobs in the Mainland. \n\n5.12 Fourth , the GBA is the most diversified city cluster in the world in terms of economic development as reflected by the huge disparity in GDP per capita (Table 2). While this economic disparity could provide internal dynamics for boosting further local economic growth and industrialisation of the GBA, if left unchecked, it could hinder the development of closer integration of the region.    \n\n> 30 Karen Yeung, “Coronavirus Adds New Hurdle for Hong Kong’s Integration into China’s Greater Bay Area Plan”, South China Morning Post , 1 March 2020, available at https://www.scmp.com/economy/ china-economy/article/3052894/coronavirus-adds-new-hurdle-hong-kongs-integration-chinas , accessed 1 June 2020.\n\n22 \n\nAPPENDIX 1 LIST OF MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE GBA \n\nCity  Infrastructure Project  Project Description \n\nHong Kong  Airport expansion  Construction of the third runway for the Hong Kong International Airport \n\nGuangzhou  Baiyun International Airport  Construction of a new terminal and two more runways to serve as a business aviation service base \n\nNansha Port  Nansha Port in the third and fourth phases of development and Nansha cruise terminal in its first phase \n\nIntercity Railway  Expansion to loop in Foshan, Jiangmen, Qingyuan and Zhuhai \n\nHigh-speed Railway  Construction of Guangzhou-Shantou high-speed railway \n\nExpressway  Expansion of Beijing-Hong Kong-Macau Expressway \n\nShenzhen  Expressway  Expansion of Shenzhen-Huizhou expressway \n\nBridge  Shenzhen-Zhongshan bridge to open in 2024 \n\nRailway  Construction of railway to Maoming, Ganzhou and Jiangxi \n\nJiangmen  Expressway  Construction of Zhongshan-Kaiping expressway and the Jiangmen section of Guangzhou-Zhongshan-Jiangmen expressway \n\nIntercity railway  Construction of the Jiangmen section of Shenzhen-Jiangmen-Maoming railway \n\nHuizhou  Expressway  Construction of the Huizhou section of the Hunan-Huizhou expressway \n\nZhongshan  Expressway  Construction of Zhongshan-Kaiping expressway and Zhongshan-Jiangmen expressway \n\nZhuhai  Intercity railway  Construction of Guangzhou-Foshan-Jiangmen-Zhuhai intercity railway \n\nAirport expansion  Construction of a new expressway and terminal \n\nZhaoqing  High-speed railway  Construction of Shenzhen-Zhaoqing high-speed railway \n\nDongguan  Bridge  The second Humen Bridge was put into operation \n\nIntercity railway  Construction of Guangzhou-Dongguan-Shenzhen intercity railway, Dongguan-Huizhou intercity railway, Foshan-Dongguan intercity railway, Zhongshan-Humen-Longgang intercity railway and Dongguan-Shenzhen rapid transit \n\nMacau  Border crossing  Construction of a new crossing adjacent to the existing checkpoint at Gongbei to expand passenger capacity \n\nBridge  The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge was put into operation in October 2018 \n\n> Source: Ernst and Young, 2019, “Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area: From Connectivity to Integration”, pp. 1-22.\n\n23 \n\nAPPENDIX A2 SALIENT PLANNED MEASURES WITHIN THE PLAN TO ENHANCE THE FINANCIAL CONNECTIVITY OF THE GBA \n\nTo enhance the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock 31  and bond connect; \n\nTo expand the channels for mainland and Hong Kong residents to invest in financial products in each other’s financial markets; \n\nTo grant Hong Kong-based firms and professionals national treatment in more financial sectors for practising, investing and doing business in the Mainland; \n\nTo permit Hong Kong and Macau RMB settlement banks to participate in the mainland interbank lending market; \n\nTo support investment institutions in Hong Kong to raise RMB funds for investing in the capital market in Hong Kong; \n\nTo allow the use of forex and RMB for carbon emissions transactions in the GBA; \n\nTo set up a future exchange in Guangzhou; \n\nTo push for cross-boundary wealth management connect between Hong Kong and the Mainland; \n\nTo allow Guangdong residents to purchase wealth management products sold by Hong Kong and Macau banks, as well as Hong Kong and Macau residents to purchase wealth management products sold by mainland banks; and to promote the integration of wealth management across Hong Kong, Macau and the nine involved Guangdong cities through establishing cross-border wealth management connection mechanisms; \n\nTo allow banking institutions in Hong Kong and Macau to develop RMB-related derivative business; \n\nTo permit Hong Kong and Macau institutional investors to invest in privately offered equity investment funds and venture investment funds in the nine mainland cities via the Qualified Foreign Limited Partnership (QFLP) programme; \n\nTo implement Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership (QDLP) and Qualified Domestic Investment Enterprise (QDIE) trials to support overseas investment through domestic, privately offered equity investment funds. \n\nTo announce specific measures in support of Macau’s efforts to act as a hub for the provision of financial services between Portuguese-speaking countries and China.

In recent years, the geographic and functional structures of industries are constantly changing due to global industrialization and regional urbanization. Thus far, a scarcity of research has investigated spatial-functional organizations of sectoral industries in urbanized megaregions. By using points of interest (POIs) data collected in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), this paper seeks to portray the spatial extent of industrial agglomerations and to label their functional characteristics. A kernel density function is first applied to measure the spatial extent of industrial agglomerations. Next, we explore the industrial functions by implementing a semantic-based information retrieval to label the functional characteristics of industrial agglomerations via words that are tokenized from POI registered names. The empirical results suggest that the concentrations of industrial activities are strongly heterogeneous across different economic sectors, revealing that agglomerations across the GBA can provide a variety types of industrial products and services. Concerning manufacturing industries, the present analysis further confirms the existence of both specialization and diversification agglomerations along with far distinct spatial characteristics. This research supplements empirical evidence and provides novel insights into the geographical and functional organizations of economic activities regarding one of the largest urban megaregions in the world. The implications that are related to megaregional economic collaboration and development are discussed.\n\n| Original language | English |\n| --- |\n| Pages (from-to) | 1995-2010 |\n| Number of pages | 16 |\n| Journal | [Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/publications/spatial-and-functional-organizations-of-industrial-agglomerations#) |\n| Volume | 49 |\n| Issue number | 7 |\n| DOIs | * [https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083221075641](https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083221075641) |\n| Publication status | Published - Sept 2022 |\n\nKeywords\n--------\n\n*   agglomeration economies\n*   functional characteristics\n*   Geographic agglomeration\n*   megaregion\n*   sectoral industries\n\nASJC Scopus subject areas\n-------------------------\n\n*   Architecture \n*   Geography, Planning and Development\n*   Urban Studies\n*   Nature and Landscape Conservation\n*   Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law\n\nUN SDGs\n-------\n\nThis output contributes to the following UN [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/)\n\n*   ![Image 4: SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/assets/sdg_icons/sustainable_cities_and_communities-31bf806f901b93759d828884fd5df53f.svg)\n\nMore information\n----------------\n\n*   [10.1177/23998083221075641](https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083221075641) \n\nOther files and links\n---------------------\n\n*   [Link to publication in Scopus](http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?scp=85127708250&partnerID=8YFLogxK) \n\nFingerprint\n-----------\n\n Dive into the research topics of 'Spatial and functional organizations of industrial agglomerations in China’s Greater Bay Area'.

Asia Pacific at global recruitment agency Phaidon International, gives his view on the latest policy changes announced on 29 August 2022 (including the new Overseas Networks & Expertise pass), and what opportunities they bring in a post-pandemic world. \n\n**By Andrew McNeilis | 15 Sep 2022**\n\n![Image 5](https://i0.wp.com/singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hero-andrew-final.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1)\n\nSingapore recently announced a slew of policy changes aimed at attracting top foreign talent. This includes the [introduction of the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass](https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2022-08-29%2Fsingapore-unveils-long-term-work-visas-to-end-talent-crunch&data=05%7C01%7CKatrina.Chui%40phaidoninternational.com%7Cf3f0e9e8eb284861d71308da8fba8b2c%7C4a1612ce20fc43f18c2771a95167b458%7C0%7C0%7C637980328604220293%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Jtks3%2BFOoB23cv8B8lIOG0KDX0qAEyJ1%2B6E%2BGcbD%2Fjg%3D&reserved=0), a five-year visa for top talent. This supplements its existing passes, including the [EntrePass and the Tech Pass](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/passes/).\n\nHere’s breaking down what this means for talent looking to move to Singapore and businesses looking to attract top talent.\n\n#### The benefits of the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass\n\n1. Five years of stability\n\nSingapore is seen as the gateway to Asia Pacific and the respective economies within the region. Therefore the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass, once it kicks in on 1 January 2023, will be very appealing to firms seeking to attract top talent.\n\nThe pass allows for five years of stability, meaning professionals considering the move to Singapore who have family will have a timeframe of certainty to plan their relocation within. Should they decide to renew their pass, there is also a possibility of extending it by another five years, subject to eligibility criteria. In addition, spouses will be able to obtain a Letter of Consent (LOC), which permits them to work in Singapore.\n\n2. A fast turnaround time\n\nThere is also the fact that the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass approval is meant to be very quick – within 4 weeks. There is no need for [Complementarity Assessment COMPASS Framework](http://mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/employment-pass/upcoming-changes-to-employment-pass-eligibility/complementarity-assessment-framework-compass) nor the [Fair Consideration Framework](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/fair-consideration-framework) job advertising requirements, meaning a speedy turnaround. This is hugely beneficial to companies as they can get ahead in such a competitive talent market.\n\n3. Progression talent within Singapore\n\nThe Overseas Networks & Expertise pass enables talent to move technically under their own means to employers. For those businesses, they will need to be hot on ensuring they offer senior, high performing talent a great employment experience because of the autonomy the pass brings professionals. The reality is that the best talent has lots of options and the five-year timeframe of the pass, plus the ability to renew, means that businesses can secure talent long term, paving the way for career progression also within Singapore.\n\n#### Other policies change to secure talent\n\nBesides the latest initiative of the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass, Singapore has also been applying significant policy changes that eases international talent movements into Singapore.\n\nSingapore’s approach to hiring international talent and the corresponding visa policies in place have been incredibly dynamic in the true sense of the word. During Covid-19, the focus was on safe measures and job security for Singaporeans, and the reality was that during the pandemic hiring international talent was not an option.\n\nPost-Covid-19 there has been an evolution. There is clearly a desire and acceptance that Singapore requires skills that are not yet present in the country, but for many businesses hiring locally is the first port of call. It makes commercial and practical sense, from a speed point of view but also for easier access and certainty.\n\n1. Reducing Employment Pass processing time\n\nFor one, the processing time for Employment Pass has been reduced drastically to 10 business days. This short turnaround – approval or otherwise – is a huge help to businesses and should be applauded.\n\n2. Increasing Employment Pass duration for tech professionals with skills in shortage\n\nSecondly, the duration of Employment Pass for tech talent with in-demand skills, has been extended from the usual 2 years to 5 years. This refers to experienced professionals in tech occupations on the COMPASS shortage Occupation List – to be announced in the coming months – earning a fixed monthly salary of $10,500.\n\nThis is also a boon to companies looking to secure top talent for longer periods, and also offers more stability to talent relocating to Singapore, and things should be clearer when the shortage Occupation List is released in the coming months.\n\nSuch policies have accelerated the ability to hire the right international talent swiftly. Delays can be incredibly detrimental to the hiring process, as both businesses and professionals want to be in an environment with maximum certainty and control.\n\nBusiness-critical talent are exposed to global opportunities and as a talent partner we must remind ourselves and the companies we represent that Singapore is competing for these professionals on a global basis. Amplifying speed and certainty is a crucial action.\n\n#### Advice on looking for career opportunities in Singapore\n\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/a02e6000e4411b55a48deca0b1235ec0)\n\nSingapore is a wonderful place to live and work, and whenever relocating is always important to research and ask for guidance.\n\n1. Familiarise yourself with local labour laws\n\nFirstly, familiarise yourself with the labour laws and how – as international talent – you might secure entry. Have enough awareness and knowledge to know if your specific skillset and experience is in demand and worthy of a visa. A useful resource to reference is the [work pass comparison table](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/passes/) that the Singapore Global Network has put together.\n\nYou will position yourself well with any firm looking to hire internationally by being able to articulate clearly what skills and capabilities you bring. For this reason it is vital your CV and job search reflects this.\n\n2. Research all benefits\n\nSecondly, beyond employment, you should do your research – be smart and work out whether this is culturally where you, or importantly you and/ or your family, want to thrive in. Again, do your homework – research housing, schools, and health. Talk to specialist talent partners, look at government websites, and ask your own network for insights.For more tips on how you may go about doing this, [I’ve put together some tips here](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/stories/business/from-army-captain-to-recruitment-md-andrew-mcneilis-shares-expert-job-search-tips/).\n\nFor example, at [Phaidon International](https://hubs.ly/Q01lQ7p90), we have produced a [Relocation Guide](https://hub.selbyjennings.sg/hubfs/Selby%20Jennings%20APAC/Selby%20Jennings_Singapore%20relocation%20guide.pdf) and our consultants work in specific niches so they can not only advise you on roles, salary and benefits, but also connect you with those who made the transition successfully. In addition, the Singapore Global Network also offers [a series of guides](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/guides/#workinsgguide) that gives you insights into what life in Singapore could be like for you and your family.\n\n#### How to attract business-critical talent to Singapore\n\nAll these new talent policies will only help Singapore secure the very best talent. Low tax, family friendly culture, excellent healthcare, and a safe law-abiding society with excellent legal recourse for business are hugely attractive features that benefit businesses and international talent alike looking to move to Singapore.\n\nThere is, however, a universal truth that for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction. Here are some of the challenges as a leading talent partner that we have found that could hold back attracting talent to Singapore.\n\n1. Rental Prices\n\nThe influx of talent from Shanghai and Hong Kong coming into Singapore has been well documented. This has, alongside construction delays due to Covid-19, impacted the price of accommodation.\n\nShort-term, there is no doubt that access and the price of rent has become a headline, and a key consideration for the best professionals with lots of international choices. If the cost of daily life eats up the low taxation benefits, this could present some challenges. As we move into 2023 perhaps rental price hikes will calm, but if not is something that candidates will need to consider as they make the move.\n\nRegarding availability of spaces at international schools, demand remains high at brand-name schools with Singapore’s growing popularity among global talent. However, it is worth noting that there are plenty of options available outside these top favourite international schools. For a list of schools and more details on their curriculum, refer to [this article](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/stories/culture/an-introduction-to-international-schools-in-singapore/) by Expat Living.\n\n2. “Dual career” families\n\nThe vast majority of families have two parents who work, and previously the [Letter of Consent](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/loc-for-ica-issued-ltvp-holders/eligibility) (LOC) was very helpful because it entitled a spouse to work in Singapore. Without this, great talent could potentially be put off because they have no guarantee of envisioning moving their family to Singapore with them. For a start, holders of the new [Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/passes/) are entitled to obtaining a LOC for spouses, and we are hopeful that future policies may reintroduce the LOC, possibly with heightened parameters.\n\n#### Looking ahead to the job market in South-East Asia\n\nTech continues to be a highly competitive environment across South-east Asia.The Financial Services sector continues to have strong demand for key tech and transformation skills, whereas some of the retail /e-commerce players have had less demand with occasional lay-offs.\n\nEmployers should be wary that a shortage of talent leads to some challenges. For example, when an employee resigns we are seeing astronomical levels of counter offers from their incumbent employer, with salaries, benefits and titles being thrown around to prevent a professional from leaving. The speed with which hiring firms are acting also reflects the talent shortage, but presents great opportunities for candidates seeking opportunities in Singapore.\n\nRegionally, we are seeing tech talent moving from hubs such as Vietnam, Hong Kong and mainland China. Importantly such talent is agnostic towards particular industry sectors – in simple terms great tech talent can move from Life Sciences to Supply Chain with ease due to their highly transferable set of technical skills.\n\n**About Phaidon International**\n\n[Phaidon International](https://hubs.ly/Q01lQ7p90) is the talent partner of choice for clients and highly skilled professionals, securing business-critical talent worldwide across six specialist brands where a relentless supply demand imbalance exists:\n\n[Selby Jennings](https://hubs.la/Q01lQ8480) – Financial Sciences & Services\n\n[LVI Associates](https://hubs.la/Q01lQ88V0) – Engineering & Infrastructure\n\n[DSJ Global](https://hubs.la/Q01lQ8610) – Supply Chain\n\n[EPM Scientific](https://hubs.la/Q01lQ85j0) – Life Sciences\n\n[Glocomms](https://hubs.la/Q01lQ8dL0) – Technology\n\n[Larson Maddox](https://hubs.la/Q01lQ8gk0) – Regulatory & Legal\n\n#### Want to learn more about Singapore's work passes?\n\n[Learn more](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/passes)\n\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/56d10d3292d0796bce2482c412fda26a)\n\n#### About Andrew McNeilis\n\nAndrew has over 30 years’ commercial experience working in strategic leadership roles across organizations ranging from start-ups to public companies throughout Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and the Americas.

Singapore’s trading history began in 1819 when the British East India Company established it as a trading settlement from which the British could extend their political and economic influence into East Asia. This historical positioning of Singapore as a place of trade, as well as a strong economy and intelligent work force, served as incentives for MNCs to invest and even base themselves in the internationalized country. Singapore encouraged MNC development with hopes that investments from developed countries would introduce modern technology and the quality of life that inherently follows from technological advancement. MNCs flocked to Singapore because telecommunications allowed them to hold coordinated offices across the globe. Companies were also better able to manage the Asian market from within; they had better market access and did not have to contend with import regulations. Despite the relationship appearing mutually satisfactory on the surface, Singapore experiences negative effects of MNC dominance, including MNC control of technology and MNC constraint on growth and development. Although the relationship between Singapore and MNCs is uneven, one can conclude that entities enter into, and remain in, relationships in order to gain political and economic advantages.\n\n**Keywords**: Singapore, multinational corporations, trade, investment, growth, development, technology, relationship, market, economy\n\n[Click here for full article](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/files/2019/11/Spring-1993-Angell.pdf)\n\n[Return to issue](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/journal-issues/issues-between-1990-1999/spring-1993/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/journal-issues/issues-between-1990-1999/spring-1993/eastern-europe-and-the-ec/) / [Next Issue](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/journal-issues/issues-between-1990-1999/fall-1993/)\n\n#### Search\n\nSearch for: \n\n#### Welcome!\n\n**Welcome to the Towson University Journal of International Affairs.**\n\n**Established in 1967, we are the oldest undergraduate-run journal of international affairs.**\n\n#### Speaker Series\n\n[![Image 4: Speaker Series](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/files/2024/09/Belgrad-Speaker-Flyer-1-544x263.png)](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/presenting-the-fall-2024-belgrad-speaker-event/)\n\n#### Recent Blog Posts\n\n*   [(no title)](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/2024/11/04/15615/)November 4, 2024\n*   [Grasping at Laws: Climate Litigation in International Courts a Step Toward Justice for Small Island Developing States?](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/2023/12/18/grasping-at-laws-climate-litigation-in-international-courts-a-step-toward-justice-for-small-island-developing-states/)December 18, 2023\n*   [The Freedom and Oppression of France’s Laïcité](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/2023/11/13/the-freedom-and-oppression-of-frances-laicite/)November 13, 2023\n*   [In the Wake of Wagner: The Dangers of Mercenary Groups](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/2023/11/11/in-the-wake-of-wagner-the-dangers-of-mercenary-groups/)November 11, 2023\n*   [BRICS Expansion: A Sign of Strength or Weakness?](https://wp.towson.edu/iajournal/2023/11/07/brics-expansion-a-sign-of-strength-or-weakness/)November 7, 2023\n\n#### Subscribe by Email\n\nCompletely spam free, opt out any time.\n\nPlease, insert a valid email.\n\nThank you, your email will be added to the mailing list once you click on the link in the confirmation email.\n\nYour Email Leave this field blank \n\nSpam protection has stopped this request.

Hong Kong is well connected to Asia's key markets, making it an ideal location for businesses to tap into the multitude of opportunities in the Mainland and Asia-Pacific region.\n\n### Impressive international reputations\n\n*   Hong Kong was ranked by Canada's Fraser Institute first globally in its Economic Freedom of the World: 2024 Annual Report.\n*   Hong Kong ranked third in the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) 37 Report published by the Z/Yen from the United Kingdom and the China Development Institute from Shenzhen.\n*   Hong Kong was recognised by the International Institute for Management Development World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025 as the third most competitive economies in the world.\n*   According to the World Trade Organization, Hong Kong ranked the seventh largest trading entity in the world in 2024.\n\n### Hong Kong's unique advantages in the Greater Bay Area\n\n*   Being the most international city in the Greater Bay Area, Hong Kong has a business-friendly environment, good tradition of the rule of law, free economic system, and well-established information technology infrastructure and financial system, as well as a wealth of high-end talents and professional services with extensive knowledge on global markets.\n*   The Outline of the 14 th Five-Year Plan for the National Economic and Social Development of the People's Republic of China (the 14 th Five-Year Plan) positions Hong Kong as the centres in eight important areas, including “four traditional centres” (namely international financial, transportation and trade centres as well as [centre for international legal and dispute resolution services](https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/opportunities/legal.html) in the Asia-Pacific region), and “four emerging centres” (namely an international aviation hub, an international innovation and technology centre, a regional intellectual property trading hub and an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange). Moreover, the 14 th Five-Year Plan supports Hong Kong in better integrating into the overall development of the country, emphasising the support for building a high-quality Greater Bay Area.\n\n### Transportation and logistics hub\n\n*   With a sound transport system and world-class infrastructure, Hong Kong is an international and regional transportation and logistics hub and is committed to developing into a cruise hub in the region.\n*   In the area of air transport services, Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is one of the world's busiest airports in terms of international passenger and cargo throughput. It has been frequently ranked one of the world's best airports. Hong Kong is within a four-hour flight from Asia's key markets and a five-hour flight from half the world's population. In the area of maritime services, Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world in terms of container throughput. Benefiting from Victoria Harbour's deep waters, no air draft limit and well-equipped cruise berthing facilities, the Kai Tai Cruise Terminal serves the world's largest cruise liners.\n*   Being well-versed in operation and regulations of international trade and possessing talents and international network, Hong Kong has been thriving in high value-added professional maritime services. On aviation, HKIA is a mature international and regional aviation hub with a well-established network of international air routes. Leveraging the advantage of an international maritime centre, Hong Kong will drive other Greater Bay Area cities to build a world-class harbour and airport cluster as well as a cluster for high-end maritime service industries in the Asia-Pacific region for the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n### Cross-boundary infrastructure\n\nThe commissioning of three significant transport infrastructure projects, namely the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB), the Hong Kong Section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL) and Liantang/Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point (LT/HYW BCP) will substantially reduce travelling time between Hong Kong and other Greater Bay Area cities, and vastly improve the transport connectivity within the Greater Bay Area, thereby creating a highly accessible Greater Bay Area as well as connecting the Greater Bay Area to the world. This will consolidate Hong Kong's status as international financial, transportation and trade centres as well as an international aviation hub.\n\n*   HZMB \n    *   The HZMB will significantly reduce transportation costs and time for travellers and goods. For example, the travelling time between the Kwai Tsing Container Terminal and Zhuhai will be reduced from currently three and a half hours or so to about 75 minutes, whilst the travelling time between the Hong Kong International Airport and Zhuhai will be reduced from currently four hours or so to about 45 minutes.\n    *   The Western Pearl River Delta (PRD) will fall within a reachable three-hour commuting radius of Hong Kong, enhancing the city's position as a trade and logistics hub as goods from the Western PRD, Western Guangdong and Guangxi can better make use of the airport and container ports in Hong Kong. The HZMB will accelerate the economic integration of the PRD and its neighbouring provinces.\n\n*   Hong Kong Section of the XRL \n    *   Scheduled to be commissioned in September 2018, the Hong Kong Section of the XRL will connect Hong Kong with the over 47 000-km National High Speed Rail Network.\n    *   The travelling time from the West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong to Shenzhen, Guangzhou as well as other cities in the PRD region will be greatly shortened, taking only about 14 minutes to Futian, 18 minutes to Shenzhen North and 47 minutes to Guangzhou South. Passengers can also reach other Greater Bay Area cities through onward transfer to the PRD Intercity Rapid Transit.\n\n*   LT/HYW BCP \n    *   The LT/HYW BCP will be the first road-based BCP in Hong Kong with direct access facilities for both passengers and vehicles. It connects with the Eastern Corridor to Longgang in Shenzhen and further extends to the eastern part of Guangdong Province via the Shenzhen-Huizhou Expressway (also known as Huizhou-Yantian Expressway) or Shenzhen-Shantou Expressway, providing a direct and efficient cross-boundary access to eastern Shenzhen, Huizhou, eastern Guangdong as well as the neighbouring provinces.\n\n### Economic and Trade Relations between Hong Kong and the Mainland\n\n*   Hong Kong has long been leveraging its unique advantages to enhance its role and functions in the process of the country's economic development and opening up of its economy. It continues to serve as a gateway for multinational companies accessing the Mainland market and as an important platform for Mainland companies seeking to expand overseas.\n*   In terms of trade, Hong Kong and the Mainland are each other's major trading partners. Since the reform and opening up of the country, the Mainland's share of Hong Kong's global trade had increased significantly from 9.3% in 1978 to 51.0% (HK$4,826.3 billion) in 2024.\n*   Hong Kong was the Mainland's third largest trading partner in 2024, and their total trade value accounted for 5.0% of the Mainland's total trade. Hong Kong was the Mainland's second largest export market, taking up 8.1% (HK$2,243.4 billion) of its total exports in 2024.\n*   The value of Hong Kong's total imports from the Mainland was HK$2,144.7 billion, accounting for 43.6% of Hong Kong's total imports in 2024. Meanwhile, the Mainland was Hong Kong's largest domestic export market, absorbing HK$20.4 billion worth of goods. In 2024, the value of goods re-exported through Hong Kong from and to the Mainland was HK$3,780.4 billion, accounting for 84.3% of Hong Kong's total re-export trade value.\n*   In terms of investment, the Mainland was Hong Kong's largest source of inward direct investment. At end-2023, investment from the Mainland accounted for about 31.1% of the total stock of Hong Kong's inward direct investment which was equivalent to HK$5,167.6 billion.\n*   Mainland companies also maintain a strong presence in Hong Kong. As at mid-2024, Mainland companies had established 2 620 regional headquarters and regional or local offices in Hong Kong.\n\n### Key areas of work\n\n1.   To consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as international financial, transportation and trade centres as well as an international aviation hub;\n2.   To develop an international innovation and technology hub;\n3.   To expand the scope of development for sectors in which Hong Kong's strengths lie;\n4.   To strengthen infrastructural connectivity;\n5.   To foster youth innovation and entrepreneurship; and\n6.   To fully utilise Hong Kong's international connections and networks to promote the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area overseas and attract capital and talents to the Greater Bay Area.\n\nGBA Cities\n\nHong Kong\n\nHong Kong\n\nMacao\n\nGuangzhou\n\nShenzhen\n\nZhuhai\n\nFoshan\n\nHuizhou\n\nDongguan\n\nZhongshan\n\nJiangmen\n\nZhaoqing\n",

The total area is around 56 000 km 2. Based on the latest figures provided by the Guangdong Province, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (SARG) and the Macao SARG, the total population in the Greater Bay Area is over 87 million and the GDP is over RMB 14 trillion in 2024.\n\nThe development of the Greater Bay Area is accorded the status of key strategic planning in the country's development blueprint, having great significance in the country's implementation of innovation-driven development and commitment to reform and opening-up. The objectives are to further deepen cooperation amongst Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, fully leverage the composite advantages of the three places, facilitate in-depth integration within the region, and promote coordinated regional economic development, with a view to developing an international first-class bay area ideal for living, working and travelling.\n\nOn 1 July 2017, witnessed by President Xi Jinping, the National Development and Reform Commission and the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao signed the [Framework Agreement on Deepening Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Cooperation in the Development of the Greater Bay Area](https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/filemanager/en/share/pdf/Framework_Agreement.pdf) in Hong Kong. The Framework Agreement sets out the goals and principles of cooperation and establishes the key cooperation areas in the development of the Greater Bay Area. Since then, the relevant Central Government departments and the three governments have strived for policy breakthroughs with an innovative and open mind in taking forward the development of the Greater Bay Area jointly.\n\nBeing the most open and international city in the Greater Bay Area, Hong Kong is known for its status as international financial, transportation, trade centres and aviation hub as well as its renowned professional services. Enjoying the dual advantages of \"one country, two systems\", Hong Kong plays an important role in the Greater Bay Area Development. On the one hand, Hong Kong will facilitate and support the economic development of the region, with a view to enhancing the role and functions of the Greater Bay Area in the country’s two-way opening up; on the other hand, we will facilitate the development of industries in which Hong Kong’s strengths lie in the Greater Bay Area, capitalising on Hong Kong’s strengths to serve the country's needs.\n\nThe promulgation of the [Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area](https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/filemanager/en/share/pdf/Outline_Development_Plan.pdf) on 18 February 2019 signified a new milestone in the development of the Greater Bay Area. With the full support of the Central Government, the Hong Kong SAR will proactively integrate into the overall national development, thereby expanding our scope of development and generating new impetus for growth to bring new development opportunities to different sectors of the community, especially our young people.\n",

As one of the most open and economically vibrant regions in China, the Greater Bay Area plays a significant strategic role in the overall development of the country. The development of the Greater Bay Area is not only a new attempt to break new ground in pursuing opening up on all fronts in a new era, but also a further step in taking forward the practice of “one country, two systems ”.The Outline Development Plan ( “the Plan ”) has been formulated to fully put the spirit of the 19 th National Congress of the Communist Party of China into practice; fully and accurately implement the principle of “one country, two systems” ; fully leverage the composite advantages of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao; deepen cooperation among the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao; further enhance the Greater Bay Area ’s supporting and leading role in the country ’s economic development and opening up; support the integration of Hong Kong and Macao into the development of the country; enhance the well-being of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots; maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao; and enable compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao to share with the people in the motherland both the historic responsibility of national rejuvenation and the pride of a strong and prosperous motherland. \n\nThis Plan is an important outline document guiding the current and future cooperation and development of the Greater Bay Area. The Plan covers the period from now to 2022 in the immediate term and extends to 2035 in the long term. 2\n\nChapter One Background of the Plan \n\nEver since the reform and opening up of China, especially the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland, cooperation among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao has continuously deepened and become more concrete. The Greater Bay Area, with a marked increase in its economic strength and regional competitiveness, already possesses the fundamental conditions for developing into an international first-class bay area and a world-class city cluster. \n\nSection 1  Foundation  of  Development \n\nDistinctive geographical advantages . Located at the forefront of China ’s opening up along the coast and with the Pan-PRD Region as its vast hinterland for development, the Greater Bay Area plays an important role in the Belt and Road Initiative. The Greater Bay Area is a highly developed transport hub. With Hong Kong as an international maritime centre, major ports such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen with throughputs among the highest in the world, and Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen being important international aviation hubs, a modern and comprehensive transport system that is both convenient and highly efficient is rapidly taking shape. \n\nRobust economic strength . The Greater Bay Area leads the country in terms of its level of economic development. It has acomprehensive industry system, with a distinctive cluster advantage and strong economic complementarity. Hong Kong and Macao have highly developed service sectors, whereas the nine PRD municipalities have initially developed an industrial structure driven by strategic emerging industries as the pilot and supported by advanced manufacturing and modern service industries as the mainstay. In 2017, the gross domestic product of the Greater Bay Area stood at around RMB 10 trillion. \n\nHigh concentration of key factors of innovation . The Greater Bay Area has intensely implemented a development strategy which is innovation-driven, with pilot measures of comprehensive innovation and reform in Guangdong well underway. The development of national innovation demonstration zones has been expedited. Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have outstanding capabilities in scientific research and 3\n\ndevelopment (R&D) and commercial application, and are home to numerous universities, scientific research institutes, high-tech enterprises and large-scale national scientific projects that have important national and even global influence. The Greater Bay Area is well-placed to attract various key factors of innovation, and has an excellent foundation for the development of an international innovation and technology hub. \n\nAdvanced level of internationalisation . As international financial, transportation and trade centres, as well as an international aviation hub, Hong Kong offers a business environment that is highly internationalised and based on the rule of law. It also has a global business network and is among the freest economies in the world. Macao ’s roles as a global tourism and leisure centre, as well as an economic and trade cooperation platform between China and Lusophone countries have been strengthened, further demonstrating its position in facilitating multi-cultural exchanges. As the economic region with the highest degree of external connection on the Mainland and an important window for opening up to the world, the nine PRD municipalities have significant functions and an important role to play in accelerating the establishment of a new system of open economy in the country. \n\nSolid cooperation foundations. Hong Kong, Macao and the nine PRD municipalities share the same cultural roots. Their people also have close ties and similar customs. The cities complement one another. Strengthened cooperation in recent years among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in areas such as infrastructural development, investment and trade, financial services, technology education, leisure and tourism, ecological and environmental protection, and social services has yielded remarkable results. A pattern of multi-level and comprehensive cooperation has been established. \n\nSection 2  Opportunities and Challenges \n\nThe present world is fast becoming multipolar, economically globalised, information-oriented and culturally diverse. The global governance system and the international order have been changing at a faster pace. As countries worldwide have become more interconnected and interdependent, the trend of peaceful development is irreversible. A new wave of technological revolution and industrial transformation is set to begin. The Belt and Road Initiative is being pursued in earnest. These developments will help enhance the international competitiveness of the 4\n\nGreater Bay Area and expand the scope of the Greater Bay Area ’sparticipation in international cooperation and competition at a higher level. Following the new vision of development, China takes forward supply-side structural reform and other reforms aiming at better quality, higher efficiency, and more robust drivers of economic growth, bringing new impetus to the transformative and innovative development of the Greater Bay Area. Major breakthroughs have been made in the comprehensive deepening of reform. The modernisation of China’s system and capacity \n\nfor governance has been substantially enhanced. These developments provide new opportunities for the Greater Bay Area to develop an institution and mechanism for, and to solve prominent problems encountered in, cooperation and development. \n\nMeanwhile, the development of the Greater Bay Area faces many challenges. The global economy is beset with uncertainty and instability as well as the rise of protectionism. The economic development of the Greater Bay Area also confronts issues such as overcapacity and the imbalance and mismatch of the supply and demand structure. The endogenous impetus for economic growth has to be strengthened. Under \n\n“one country, two systems”, Guangdong , Hong Kong and Macao have different social systems and legal systems. They are separate customs territories. Market connectivity needs to be further improved and an efficient flow of factors of production has yet to be attained. There remains a relatively wide development gap within the Greater Bay Area and coordination and compatibility will need to be strengthened. Homogeneous competition and mismatch of resources exist in certain regions and sectors. Continuous economic growth in Hong Kong lacks sustainable and stable support. The economic structure of Macao is relatively homogeneous with limited resources for development. The market economy structure in the nine PRD municipalities calls for improvement. Regional development faces various bottlenecks, including growing constraints on resources and energy supplies, escalating pressure on ecology and the environment, and a gradual reduction in the demographic dividend. \n\nSection 3  Significance  of the Plan \n\nThe development of the Greater Bay Area and of a world-class city cluster will facilitate the enrichment of the implementation of “one country, two systems” and foster closer cooperation between the Mainland \n\nand the two SARs, thereby creating more opportunities for the 5\n\nsocio-economic development of the two SARs and for Hong Kong and Macao compatriots wishing to develop careers on the Mainland, as well as maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao. It will facilitate the implementation of the new vision of development; the stepping up of supply-side structural reform; the accelerated development of new economic drivers; and the early realisation of innovation-driven development to support the continued growth in innovation capability and competitiveness of the Chinese economy. It will facilitate the further deepening of reform and further opening up; the building of a new system of open economy in line with international standards; and the development of a new platform for high-level international cooperation. It will facilitate the advancement of the Belt and Road Initiative. By means of two-way opening up, the Greater Bay Area will develop into an important support area for the convergence of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21 st \n\nCentury Maritime Silk Road. 6\n\nChapter Two \n\nOverall  Requirements \n\nSection 1  Guiding Ideology \n\nTo fully apply Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the spirit of the 19 th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, coordinate the implementation of the \n\n“Five-sphere Integrated Plan ” and the “Four-pronged Comprehensive Strategy ”, fully and faithfully implement the principle of “one country, two systems” under which the people of Hong Kong govern Hong Kong, the people of Macao govern Macao with a high degree of autonomy, act in strict adherence to the Constitution and the Basic Laws, remain committed to the new vision of development, fully understand and utilise the systemic strengths of “one country, two systems” , the unique strengths of Hong Kong and Macao, as well as the strengths of early and pilot implementation of reform and opening up in Guangdong, emancipate the mind and explore boldly, continuously deepen mutually beneficial cooperation among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, further establish a mutually beneficial relationship in regional cooperation, promote coordinated regional economic development, give new impetus to the development of Hong Kong and Macao, provide support for national supply-side structural reform, the implementation of the innovation-driven development strategy and the building of a new system of an open economy, develop a vibrant and internationally competitive first-class bay area and world-class city cluster, and build a role model of high-quality development. \n\nSection 2  Basic Principles \n\nTo be driven by innovation and led by reform .

It focuses in particular on Singapore, which offers a unique platform for business in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific area, and where many Bay Area companies have established major regional operations. In doing so, it looks at the distinctive synergies between the Bay Area and Singapore around technology, innovation, urban development, and other fields where priorities and capacities align.\n\nAbout This Report \n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nThis report was developed and written by Sean Randolph, Senior Director at the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.

ASEAN, much like the European Union and other multinational economic communities, endeavors to increase economic prosperity through economic, political, social, and cultural cooperation. The ASEAN member nations compose a region with a population of 650 million that has sustained high growth for more than three decades.\n\n### Singapore and ASEAN’s Five Fast-Growing Economies at a Glance, 2017–2018\n\n[![Image 3](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Exhibit1EconomiesAtAGlance.jpg)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Exhibit1EconomiesAtAGlance.jpg)\n\n### As Manufacturing Shifts from China, Southeast Asia Will Be the Primary Beneficiary\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, many Southeast Asian economies lost ground to China, whose size and growth attracted international investment at a large scale. Since 2015, however, they have regained ground. This has been driven in part by rising costs in China, trade conflicts with the US and other countries driven by Chinese industrial and technology policies, and challenges faced by overseas companies in accessing China’s market. As US companies look to diversify their Asian presence, economic growth and rising middle classes in Southeast Asia offer an alternative destination in the region.\n\n### The Region’s Internet Economy is Growing Rapidly\n\n*   There were more than 360 million internet users in the six leading countries in 2019—100 million more than in 2015.\n*   More than 90% of Southeast Asians connect to the internet primarily through smartphones, making Southeast Asia one of the most mobile-first internet regions globally.\n*   In 2019, Southeast Asia’s internet economy reached an estimated $100 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) across the online travel, e-commerce, online media, and ride hailing sectors—up 40% from 2018.\n*   Internet economy investment in the region has grown at an exponential pace since reaching the $1 billion mark in 2015. The inward funding flow reached a record high of $14.1 billion in 2018, and internet firms raised $7.6 billion in the first 6 months of 2019, about 7% more than in the first half of 2018.\n*   Governments across the region are capitalizing to accelerate the delivery of government services digitally.\n*   This activity is reflected in increasingly vibrant startup ecosystems.\n\n[Read the Full Report (PDF)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/files/pdf/SingaporeAndTheBayAreaJanuary2020.pdf)\n\nSingapore's Economy\n-------------------\n\nPlanning Execution, and Open Markets\n\n[![Image 4](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SkylineAndMerlionADJUST1280x457.jpg)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SkylineAndMerlionADJUST1280x457.jpg)\n\n Since its independence in 1965, Singapore has evolved from a small trading center to become a major transshipment port, an international financial center, a regional base for multinational corporations, and a production center intimately linked to global supply chains. It is now aspiring to become a regional center for technology and innovation. Strategically, its economy has been moving progressively toward higher value activities.\n\n*   Global Rankings: Global indexes consistently rank Singapore among the world’s most competitive and innovative economies.\n*   Government Strategies: Singapore’s government engages deeply in economic planning and has been extraordinarily effective in the development and execution of medium and long-term strategies. In contrast to many countries, execution is a priority and existing plans are closely monitored and adapted as conditions change.\n*   The Push for Innovation: Singapore’s government is attempting to build a local innovation ecosystem. A work in progress, its push builds on initiatives led by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the National Research Foundation (NRF), and the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE).\n*   A Focus on Startups: BLOCK71 provides Singaporean and other startups one-stop access to supportive services; the program’s seven buildings now house 250 companies and 30 incubators and venture firms, and there are additional facilities in Indonesia, China, and San Francisco. Fusionopolis and Biopolis, facilities in Singapore’s one-north area, are designed to stimulate concentrated key technology clusters. EDBI (the investment arm of the Economic Development Board), Singtel Innov8, SG Innovate, and SEEDS Capital invest in startups across multiple stages. Sovereign wealth funds GIC and Temasek invest globally in both listed companies and startups.\n\n[Read the Full Report (PDF)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/files/pdf/SingaporeAndTheBayAreaJanuary2020.pdf)\n\nThe Bay Area and Singapore\n--------------------------\n\nExpanding Economic Ties and Business Opportunities\n\n[![Image 5](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14532384255_e39ca942e1_oFlickr-NigelSwalesADJUST1280x457.jpg)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14532384255_e39ca942e1_oFlickr-NigelSwalesADJUST1280x457.jpg)\n\n### An Important Trade and Investment Relationship\n\nDespite its small population, Singapore is an outsized trading partner.\n\n*   Under a free trade agreement between the United States and Singapore that has been in place since 2004 supporting two-way market access in goods, services, investment, and government procurement, US goods exports to Singapore are subject to zero tariffs, and US service exports receive national treatment (meaning that US service suppliers are treated the same as domestic suppliers).\n*   Two-way trade, already strong before the agreement was signed, has continued to grow, reaching $90 billion in goods and services in 2018, with a positive trade balance.\n*   Singapore is California’s 12th largest global export market, with sales of $4.435 billion in 2018.\n*   Singapore was the 6th fastest-growing source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States in 2018. The stock of Singaporean FDI in the US totaled $54.2 billion in 2018, while the stock of US FDI in Singapore totaled $218.8 billion. \n\n### The Bay Area in Singapore\n\nAlong with other global companies, Bay Area companies have a substantial presence in Singapore, making it a business hub for Southeast Asia whose reach also extends to East Asia, Australia, and in some cases to India. Many factors lie behind this, including favorable tax policies, a high quality of life for expatriates, and a central location in Southeast Asia with access to efficient transportation networks. Singapore’s open economy and rule of law offer a stable long-term base.\n\n### Singapore in the Bay Area\n\nReflecting the Bay Area’s central role as a global technology and innovation hub, Singapore’s government has established a significant footprint in the region. By leveraging its assets, the goal is to support entrepreneurial activity, attract investment, and more deeply connect the two innovation ecosystems. Presences include the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), Enterprise Singapore (ESG), BLOCK71 San Francisco, Smart Nation, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore’s sovereign wealth funds GIC (Government Investment Corporation) and Temasek, and startups and corporate connections.\n\n[Read the Full Report (PDF)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/files/pdf/SingaporeAndTheBayAreaJanuary2020.pdf)\n\nSingapore and ASEAN\n-------------------\n\nBuilding New Synergies\n\n[![Image 6](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wengang-zhai-yzi2t_p8n5Q-unsplash1280x457.jpg)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wengang-zhai-yzi2t_p8n5Q-unsplash1280x457.jpg)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEconomic growth in Singapore and the ASEAN region is offering new opportunities for Bay Area and California companies and organizations to expand or diversify their presence in Asia. Of 18 high-growth “outperformers” identified in a September 2018 McKinsey Global Institute study of high-growth emerging economies, four long-term outperformers—Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia—are ASEAN member countries. Underlying this performance are pro-growth policies, fueled by strong competitive dynamics. Young populations, rising middle classes, increased technological capacity, and an explosion of internet and mobile activity are driving the process. Singapore in particular offers a business environment characterized by open markets, transparency, and the rule of law.\n\nThese developments are producing new synergies with the Bay Area based on investment, R&D, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity. These opportunities, led by Singapore as a unique regional platform, will continue to expand as Southeast Asia grows in strategic and economic importance.\n\n[Read the Full Report (PDF)](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/files/pdf/SingaporeAndTheBayAreaJanuary2020.pdf)\n\nGet Email Updates\n\n*   Name* First Last  \n*   Email*  \n\n![Image 7: Bay Area Council Economic Institute Logo](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/themes/bacei/img/logo.png)\n\n**Bay Area Council Economic Institute**\n\n The Historic Klamath, Pier 9\n\n San Francisco, CA 94111\n\n Phone: (415) 981-7117 • Fax: (415) 981-6408 •[Email](mailto:bacei@bayareacouncil.org)\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bay-area-council)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/bayareaeconomy)\n\nNotifications\n\n*   [Tweet](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection on Twitter\")\n*   [Facebook](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection on Facebook\")\n*   [](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection by email\")\n\nShare this selection \n*   [Tweet](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection on Twitter\")\n*   [Facebook](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection on Facebook\")\n*   [](https://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/singapore-and-the-bay-area \"Share this selection by email\")\n",

It does not represent in any way a forecast or projection by MAS or by me. My intention is merely to paint a plausible scenario for Singapore. I can only be sure that someone reading this in 2065 will view it as totally lacking in imagination or realism or both._\n\nProfessor Euston Quah, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.\n\nThis year, Singapore celebrates 100 years as an independent nation. The Global-Asian Economic Review, or GAER, is relatively young, at 25 years old. But the GAER comes from a long tradition that goes back to the very beginnings of Singapore.\n\n*   It began life as the Malayan Economic Review in 1956, was renamed the Singapore Economic Review in 1969, and took new birth as the Global-Asian Economic Review in 2040.\n*   As the leading journal on economic issues that lie at the intersection of the world and Asia, the GAER's evolution has mirrored that of Singapore itself - starting life as part of Malaya, becoming independent, and then expanding its vision to become a Global-Asian entity limited neither by geography nor history.\n\nWe are a young nation by the standards of other countries but a hundred years is not a flash in the pan either. Amidst the centennial celebrations, it is worthwhile recalling the journey that Singapore has made as a nation since its humble beginnings in 1965. As this is a gathering of economists, I will do so in the form of a brief economic history of Singapore over the last century.\n\n#### Our economic progress in a nutshell\n\nLet me begin by reviewing the economic progress we have made as a nation in the last 100 years, from three perspectives, namely the level, generation, and distribution of income.\n\nFirst, the level of income. I will use Gross Domestic Product rather than Gross National Income since the GNI measure that we use today is not available for the earlier years.\n\n*   In 1965, Singapore's nominal GDP per capita was around US$500. We were at the same level as Mexico and South Africa.\n*   In 1990, GDP per capita had risen to about US$13,000, surpassing South Korea, Israel, and Portugal.\n*   In 2015, GDP per capita was about US$56,000. We had caught up with Germany and the United States.\n*   By 2040, when our GDP per capita had reached US$96,000, we were already among the top-ranked countries in the world and our benchmark became cities. We were among the top 25 cities then.\n*   Today, in 2065, GDP per capita is US$120,000, fifth highest among cities in the world.\n\nSecond, the generation of income. Just as important as the level of income is: how we produced it, and what resources did we use?\n\n*   Output per hour worked has increased considerably.\n\nIn 2015, Singaporeans worked 2,300 hours.\n\nThis year Singaporeans are expected to work only 1,400 hours.\n\nBut we are now generating nearly three times as much income as 50 years ago.\n\n*   The carbon intensity of our economy has fallen sharply.\n\nIn 2015, we emitted 0.2 kilograms of carbon to produce a dollar of output.\n\nToday, we emit just 0.05 kilograms.\n\nThird, the distribution of income.\n\n*   Income distribution has become more equal, thanks to heavy investments in building human capital and skills as well as a tax and transfers system that has become more progressive over the years.\n\nIn 2015, the Gini coefficient after taking account of taxes and transfers was 0.41.\n\nToday, it is 0.36.\n\n*   Wealth inequality has remained more stubborn though.\n\nToday, the top 1% and 10% of wealth holders in Singapore own around 20% and 60% of total wealth respectively.\n\nThis is little changed from 30 years ago, when we first started to collect this data.\n\n#### 1965-1984: Export-led industrialisation through multinationals\n\nIn 1965, when Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia, few expected it to survive let alone prosper. Singapore's first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, had said in 1957 that the idea of an independent Singapore was a \"political, economic, and geographical absurdity\". It is not hard to see why.\n\n*   An island of 580 squares kilometres at low tide, Singapore in 1965 had no natural resources, no hinterland, no industry.\n*   It depended on the outside world not just for food and energy, but even water.\n*   Industrial strife was common. Unemployment was close to 9%.\n\nSingapore's birth pangs were traumatic.\n\n*   Separation from Malaysia meant the loss of not just a common market but a hinterland.\n*   Indonesia's Confrontasi cut off Singapore's southern hinterland, further undermining the fledgling nation's traditional role as an entrepot trading post for the region.\n*   In 1968, the British government announced a withdrawal of its troops from Singapore, which left thousands of workers without a job and as much as a fifth of the economy at risk of coming to a halt.\n\nSurviving as a nation and creating a better life for the people were thus the over-riding priorities. And economic growth was seen as the principal means to help achieve this.\n\nThe government made two strategic decisions - both sharply at odds with the conventional economic wisdom of the time.\n\n*   The first was to shift away from import-substitution in favour of export-led industrialisation.\n*   The second was to attract global multinational corporations as vehicles to achieve industrial growth.\n\nThese two decisions proved to be among the most important in our economic history. Promoting exports and promoting foreign direct investments at a time when few other countries were doing the same gave Singapore a decisive advantage.\n\nBut it was an advantage that Singapore had to work hard to realise.\n\n*   The government developed industrial land, put in place infrastructure facilities, reformed labour laws to promote industrial peace, and invested in basic education with emphasis on technical skills relevant to industrialisation.\n*   Sound fiscal and monetary policies ensured macroeconomic stability and underpinned investor confidence.\n\nThe two strategies paid off handsomely.\n\n*   By 1975, Singapore had established a substantial industrial base, with manufacturing's share in GDP climbing to 22% from 14% in 1965.\n*   The economy was at full employment and it was clear that Singapore had to move up the value chain towards more capital-intensive and skill-intensive activities.\n\nThe compositional change within manufacturing was striking.\n\n*   Industrialisation began in the 1960s with factories producing items such as matches, fish hooks and mosquito coils.\n\nBy the way, for those unfamiliar, mosquitoes used to spread life-threatening diseases in the tropics in those days until the disease-causing ones were eradicated in 2033 by genetic modification.\n\n*   In any case, these labour-intensive industries saw a steady decline through the 1970s.\n\nBy the late 1970s and early 1980s, we saw the emergence of strong clusters in higher value-added electronics, petrochemicals, component and precision engineering.\n\n*   In the 1980s, Singapore became the world's leading producer of hard disk drives - an early form of memory storage used in computers at the time.\n\nThe first two decades of Singapore's economic history could be described as the \"take-off\" phase. It was the period when the economic fundamentals of prudent public finances, sound monetary policies, co-operative industrial relations, outward orientation, and market-based strategies took root. The economy grew by an average of about 10% each year during this period, and Singapore emerged as a newly-industrialised economy at the forefront of developing countries.\n\n#### 1985-2010: Liberalisation and the rise of modern services\n\nIn 1985, the Singapore economy went into recession - the only time in our history the domestic economy contracted while the global economy was still growing. The 1985 recession exposed structural strains in the economy, which had hitherto been masked by strong economic growth.\n\n*   As the earlier phase of \"catch-up\" growth came to an end, resource constraints and diminishing returns to investment began to set in.\n*   The cost advantage that Singapore enjoyed began to narrow.\n\nThe 1985 recession was a significant milestone in Singapore's development history. It led to a fundamental review of the policies and strategies that prevailed at the time. The most important outcomes from that period of review which continued into the 1990s were the structural reforms to:\n\n*   enhance wage flexibility in the labour market;\n*   tap more decisively into regional markets for trade and outward investment;\n*   step up the pace of industrial upgrading;\n*   promote innovation, enterprise, and entrepreneurship in the economy; and\n*   liberalise various services sectors such as finance, telecommunications, and utilities.\n\nIn fact, the key story post985 recession up till the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 was the rise of modern services as a twin engine of growth alongside manufacturing.\n\n*   The share of modern services in GDP increased steadily, from 16% in 1965 to 24% in 1985 and 28% in 2010.\n\n_Financial services_. Singapore was already a thriving regional financial centre since the 1970s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the insurance and securities industries were completely liberalised and progressive steps were taken to open up the domestic banking industry to foreign competition.\n\n_Business services_. A broad range of business activities - accounting, law, advertising, and consultancy - grew in importance, playing an important role in cementing Singapore's status as a regional hub.\n\n_Info-communications services_. The government embarked on a plan to computerise the civil service in the early 1980s. This helped to kick-start the info-communication services industry, one of the mainstays of the economy ever since.\n\n_Entertainment services._ In 2005, the government decided to allow two casinos to operate within integrated resorts that also included leisure facilities, business and convention zones, and high-end retail outlets. This sparked the growth of a thriving entertainment services industry over the next few decades, attracting the burgeoning Asian middle class.\n\nThis second phase of our economic development essentially saw the transition of Singapore from Third World to First World. By 2010, Singapore was an affluent society and a global city, at the cross-roads of international flows of trade, investment, finance and talent. Real GDP grew an average 6.7% per annum during this period.\n\nIt was also a period in which the economy was buffeted by one crisis after another:\n\n*   the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998;\n*   the collapse of the global IT industry in 2001;\n*   the spread of the deadly SARS virus in 2003; and\n*   the Global Financial Crisis in 2008\n\nBut the economy grew in resilience, rebounding sharply and emerging stronger after each economic shock.\n\n#### 2011-2025: Demographic slowdown and economic restructuring\n\nThe dominant theme in the third phase of Singapore's economic history was the overcoming of resource constraints through a significant restructuring of the economy. While Singapore had always been short of land and labour, these constraints came to a head in the 2010s.\n\nBy 2011, annual growth in the total working age population had declined to less than 3%, and continued to fall steadily over the decade.\n\n*   Foreign labour, which had driven Singapore's labour force growth since the late 1970s, was already one-third of the total workforce.\n*   It was neither economically efficient nor socially desirable to allow the foreign workforce to expand much faster than the local workforce. By 2020, average total labour force growth was down to 1% per annum.\n\nThe central thrust of economic strategies in the 2010s and early 2020s was therefore to shift to a productivity-driven growth model. The aim was to increase productivity growth to at least 2% per annum, from the 1.4% averaged during the 2000s.\n\n*   The growth of lower-skilled foreign labour was curbed through increases in the foreign worker levy and reductions in the foreign worker dependency ratio ceilings.\n*   Financial incentives were given to firms to undertake capital deepening and adopt technology solutions to raise productivity.\n*   Programmes were put in place to help Singaporeans develop and master skills in new growth clusters.\n\nWhile the manufacturing sector had continually undergone restructuring and moved up the value chain in the preceding five decades, this was the first time the entire economy was undergoing such a transition.\n\n*   It proved particularly challenging for many traditional domestically-oriented services like retail, hospitality, construction, real estate, and social services, which had come to be heavily dependent on cheap labour over the decades.\n*   While many firms in these sectors successfully upgraded themselves and became more efficient, there was a substantial reduction in the size of these sectors by the early 2020s.\n\nBut the decisive turnaround in the quest for productivity came when services industries with a traditionally domestic orientation, like education and healthcare, re-positioned themselves by scaling up, investing in technology and talent, and exporting their services.\n\nThe idea of Singapore as a Global School House was not new but it was pursued with renewed vigour and came to full fruition only during this period. Singapore positioned itself as a choice location for quality education for a growing Asian middle class.\n\n*   By 2025, international students studying in Singapore could be awarded joint degrees from 10 of the top 20 universities in the world.\n*   Singapore was well on its way to become the premier educational hub of Asia.\n\nSimilarly, the healthcare sector was opened up.\n\n*   By 2025, Singapore had become a multi-faceted medical hub hosting the world's top medical professionals and multi-national healthcare companies.\n*   This led to a vibrant ecosystem that created jobs in areas from research and training to conventions for medical professionals both locally and abroad, in addition to the large and diverse number of good jobs in hospitals.\n\nThis third phase of Singapore's economic history marked the most significant step-down in Singapore's economic growth, with real GDP growing by 3.6% per annum. However, it also marked the painful but successful economic transition towards productivity-led growth. By 2025, the economy had matured, with productivity growth accounting for virtually all of economic growth.\n\n#### 2026-2040: Regional integration and technological transformation\n\nThe fourth phase of Singapore's economic development saw the fruition of the decades-long quest for regional integration and the rise to prominence of what we refer to today as our offshore economy. This was also the period that saw widespread technological transformation and the emergence of the ideas economy.\n\nBy 2040, the global centre of economic gravity had shifted decisively to Asia.\n\n*   China was by far the largest economy in the world, with per capita incomes approaching that of upper middle income countries.\n*   India emerged as the third largest economy in the world, with the largest middle class and a global network of indigenous multinationals.\n*   But perhaps most significant for Singapore was the emergence of Indonesia as the fastest growing economy in the world, following far-reaching economic reforms in the early 2020s.\n\nSingapore's high-end manufacturing and modern services benefitted significantly from trade and investment links with these Asian giants, in addition to the Unites States and the North Euro Area.\n\nBut the real game-changer was the setting up of two supra-national economic zones.\n\nIn 2028, Malaysia and Singapore got together to set up the Iskandar-Singapore Economic Zone or ISEZ: one economic system spanning two sovereign countries.\n\n*   The experiment succeeded beyond expectations, providing global and regional investors an integrated production and services base that was unmatched in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn 2030, the most ambitious blueprint of the ASEAN Economic Community process came into being, with the establishment of the ASEAN Free Economic Zone, or AFEZ.\n\n*   Unlike traditional economic zones like the ISEZ which were contiguous entities, the AFEZ was a network of the major cities across ASEAN connected by extensive road, rail, air, and sea links, not to mention advanced digital communications.\n*   There was free movement of goods, services, capital, and people between these cities, which become vibrant hubs for trade and enterprise.\n\nWhile the bulk of the economic benefits of the AFEZ rightly accrued to the developing economies of Indo-China, Singapore benefitted from being the nerve centre of this network with extensive backward and forward linkages between the offshore economy and the territorial economy.\n\nThe Singapore economy which had hitherto been characterised by the export of goods and services was increasingly being driven by the export of capital and people.\n\n*   Singapore firms shifted a substantial volume of production offshore and increased ownership of production facilities in the AFEZ.\n*   Increased connectivity enabled large numbers of Singaporeans to work in the AFEZ while maintaining home in Singapore.\n*   The government partnered the private sector to build offshore satellite towns and industrial parks in the AFEZ to cater to the needs of Singapore MNCs and overseas communities.\n\nThe gross inflows of income derived from the deployment of Singapore's capital and people abroad rose by 50% between 2026 and 2040.\n\n*   For the first time, these inflows exceeded the income repatriated abroad by MNCs operating in Singapore.\n*   Gross National Income (GNI) per capita became the more relevant measure of Singapore's income and standard of living than just GDP per capita.\n\nThe 2020s and 2030s saw the proliferation and convergence of several technological trends that transformed economies and societies globally.\n\n*   Rapid progress in digital and mobile technologies, coupled with advanced biometrics and global wi-fi access, made payments virtually costless and highly secure, precipitating an explosion in the growth of digital commerce and digital finance.\n*   Advances in cloud computing, big data analytics, smart sensors and learning machines transformed the provision of consumer and business services, including financial, legal, auditing, consultancy, and logistics.\n*   They also spurred a transformation in the provision of social and public services such as telemedicine, online learning, and congestion control, substantially enhancing efficiency and consumer welfare.\n\nSingapore was well-positioned for the pervasive digitisation of the global economy that occurred in the 2020s and 2030s, mainly due to two key initiatives that it embarked on in 2015 in the drive towards productivity-led growth:\n\n*   The first was the concerted national effort to build and deepen skills at all levels through extensive worker retraining programmes and subsequent introduction of the teaching of digital technology across the education system.\n*   The second was the drive to create a Smart Nation - building critical infrastructure and capabilities in digital and sensor technologies.\n\nBy 2040, a thriving ideas economy had taken root in Singapore, with value-added embedded in ideas rather than physical form.\n\n*   The creation of economic value was associated increasingly with \"dematerialised products\" such as telecommunications, algorithms, software, design, testing and research.\n*   At the same time, Singapore built on its traditional strengths in the ideas economy, namely marketing, branding, and global supply chain management.\n\nAdvances in robotics and 3-D printing helped to spawn new activities in Singapore's offshore facilities in the AFEZ:\n\n*   production of space vehicles and supersonic jet engines;\n*   additive manufacturing of components for electric cars and autonomous vehicles.\n\nTechnological advances also transformed the structure of the territorial economy.\n\n*   Cutting-edge biologics to produce drugs for cancer, auto-immune diseases, congenital disorders and dementia emerged as the largest component of manufacturing.\n*   Real-time genome sequencing for disease control started from scratch to become one of the fastest growing segments within the territorial economy.\n*   Infrastructure financing became the largest contributor to modern services, with Singapore-based financial institutions and markets financing projects ranging from the Sino-Indian lunar complex to the pan-ASEAN nuclear fusion reactors.\n\nDuring this period, regional integration and technological advances helped sustain GNI growth of 2.9% per annum and GDP growth at 2.6% per annum, a remarkable performance given the maturing of the economy. But the period was not free of crisis.\n\n*   The Global Cyber Crisis of 2034 triggered the deepest recession in Singapore's history, with the economy contracting by 8.5% that year.\n*   The resurgence of smallpox and resultant pandemic in 2039 plunged the global economy into a recession that lasted two years, not to mention the tragic toll on human lives. It remains till today the darkest period in our nation's history.\n\n#### 2041-2065: Climate change mitigation and adaptation\n\nBy 2040, climate change had become the defining issue facing the global economy, including Singapore. It has been the key driver of the transformation of our economy over the last 25 years.\n\nAs recently as 50 years ago, climate change was still a matter of debate internationally, although it was known that global surface temperatures had been rising since 1850.\n\n*   But by 2020, it had been established firmly that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases were the dominant cause of global warming and that climate change on an existential scale was inevitable if urgent actions were not taken.\n*   It took the global community another 10 years to reach an agreement on carbon emission reductions.\n\nThe Global Climate Change Compact of 2030 - with subsequent reviews every ten years - was probably the most important international agreement in history.\n\n*   By committing countries to significant absolute reductions in carbon emissions, it helped slow down and eventually arrest global warming, thereby forestalling calamitous changes in the climate.\n*   But in some respects, the Compact was too late. Some degree of climate change and its effects could not be avoided, chief of which was a persistent rise in sea levels.\n\nAdapting to climate change thus became as important a consideration as mitigating it. In 2041, the government announced a comprehensive programme to restructure the economy and reposition society for the new world emerging in the wake of climate change.\n\nThe introduction of a carbon tax helped to reduce carbon intensity in economic activities, increase energy efficiency, and modify consumption patterns. By 2055, the green industry emerged as the largest contributor to Singapore's Gross National Income, covering a wide range of economic activities:\n\n*   reconfiguration of earlier technologies, such as robots that were powered by electricity, to make them more sustainable in a carbon-constrained world;\n*   development of geo-engineering solutions to reduce the earth's capacity to absorb heat and re-freeze the polar ice caps through altering the natural environment;\n*   research, production, and deployment of renewable energy solutions centred on solar, hydrogen, nuclear fusion, algae biofuels, and zero-carbon diesel fuels recycled from atmospheric carbon;\n*   trading of carbon emission permits, carbon credit options, and other derivatives to manage carbon-related risks;\n*   energy consultancy and engineering services as well as specialty insurance against various kinds of climate change occurrences.\n\nIn the area of climate change adaptation, the Dyke Construction Programme, launched in 2045, proved critical not only in preventing the ongoing rise in sea levels from inundating our island, but also in generating a variety of ancillary economic activities. Adapting and building on the earlier Dutch designs and technologies, Singapore became a major exporter of dyke solutions to many other coastal cities around the world.\n\nThe last 25 years have seen perhaps the most significant transformation of the Singapore economy - competitive, dynamic, resilient, and environmentally sustainable. GDP grew by an average 1.5% per annum, and GNI 1.7% per annum.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nLet me conclude.\n\nI have described the evolution of our economy over the last 100 years, chiefly from the perspective of industrial developments, technological trends, and other global forces. It is a story of continuous restructuring, made possible by a judicious blend of the invisible hand of the market and the visible hand of good government.\n\nBut the key non-economic factor that made this development journey possible is the culture of our people.\n\nIt is a culture of innovation. Today, we have a highly productive and engaged workforce with deep skills, continually learning and taking advantage of new technologies, and building meaningful careers. It is this spirit of constant adaptation and lifelong learning that has\n\nIt is also a culture of resilience. Singapore has undergone various upheavals and crises over the last 100 years - recession, terrorism, pandemic - not to mention the dislocations and anxieties caused by globalisation, technological advance, population ageing, and climate change. Our strength has not been to insulate ourselves from crisis but to bounce back from it, stronger and more resolute.\n\nFinally, it is a culture of cohesion. We have come this far because we have worked together and stayed together, with those who have done well doing their part for the less fortunate. It is not only about a willingness to pay higher taxes to support an ageing population but the spirit of philanthropy and volunteerism that has taken root in our society, especially over the last 50 years. Our economic success could not have been possible without this deeper social cohesion that has held the nation together.\n",

world class urban agglomeration with the strongest market vitality in China. Covering 56,000 square kilometres, the 80 million-resident region produced more than 11 trillion RMB in economic output in 2020. Since the return of Hong Kong and Macao to China, collaboration between the three regions has been deepened, leading to increased economic prowess and greater competitiveness.\n\n**Major business layouts of the three regions**\n\nHong Kong focuses on finance, shipping, logistics and modern services. While home to many world-class universities, however, it suffers from sluggish economic and social development due to difficulties in commercializing academic achievements and a lack of industrial resources. Therefore, it should give play to its advantages in finance, shipping, logistics and modern services to better serve the GBA, while stepping up technology innovation to industrialise academic achievements.\n\nMacao is dominated by tourism and leisure. Similar to Hong Kong, its relatively singular economic structure coupled with small geographical area has led to slow growth. Therefore, the government’s decision to allow Macao and Guangdong to jointly govern the 106-square-kilometer Hengqin Island has provided needed land to help Macao diversify its economy and achieve sustainable development. Macao should focus on further exploring diversifying economic structures in Hengqin.\n\nMeanwhile, Guangdong’s nine major cities have large economic volume, and are well-positioned to support emerging industries, advanced manufacturing and modern services. For Guangdong, the next step should be to promote its emerging industries, step up innovation and coordinate more development with other two regions.\n\n**How can the three regions complement each other?**\n\nThe GBA can achieve greater coordination in a number of ways. First, promoting the construction of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macao Science and Technology Innovation Corridor to facilitate cross-border exchange; second, strengthening capital market interconnection and further improving offshore and onshore markets; third, advancing judicial coordination mechanisms for intellectual property rights; fourth, boosting the coordinated development of shipping and aviation industries between the four places; fifth, fostering closer cooperation in the cultural and creativity industries.\n\nMeanwhile, more consideration should also be given to the roles of Qianhai and Henqin to combine institutional innovation and industry development.\n\n**The role of new infrastructure construction in developing the GBA**\n\nFrom the perspective of supply chains, new infrastructure plays a critical role in the upgrade and transformation of the industrial and supply chains in the GBA in the following three ways:\n\nFirstly, to fill in the gap of China’s industrial and supply chains. Take chips, for example. Currently, China is dependent on overseas supplies which can easily be restrained. The technological innovation and industrial transformation of the GBA can propel the research and development of China’s chip industry by leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages in innovation and talent, as well as chip design enterprises such as Huawei and Hisilicon in Shenzhen.\n\nSecondly, to enhance the effective coordination of the GBA’s industrial and supply chains to improve the global competitiveness of products and services. The key is to integrate the supply chain mindset into the planning and development process of new infrastructure. For example, while digitally upgrading industrial parks, it is also necessary to plan and coordinate industrial and supply chains between different parks so as to create a sound ecology that integrates industry and finance. In the process of building intelligent logistics hubs (such as airports, ports and distribution centres), we should also emphasis the digital networks of different supply chains, making sure they are manageable to help clients optimise the logistics supply chain based on data analysis.\n\nThirdly, to promote the national ‘dual carbon’ goals. Taking charging stations of new energy vehicles as an example, at present, we still have a large number of public charging stations, with the vehicle-pile ratio dropping to 2.9:1. However, in practice, you will find that many public charging stations are slow to charge and some are even broken. Therefore, in the future, the GBA can tap into building high-powered, fast-charging stations and exploring new types of infrastructure such as battery swapping stations to assist the EV transformation.\n\n_Zhao Xiande is the Professor of Operations and Supply Chain Management at CEIBS.

It also boasts a long history of foreign investment.\n\nSince its inception in 2017, the GBA initiative has generated high expectations from the business community for coordinated development among the cities. Progressing rapidly, the removal of barriers that restrict the movement of capital, trade, information, and people, in combination with targeted government policies, is expected to continue to foster growth across its main areas and sectors.\n\nCities and Economic Zones\n-------------------------\n\n[Explore Service](https://www.dezshira.com/services/business-advisory?ENTRY=%252Fdoing-business-guide%252Fchina%252Fwhere-to-invest%252Fgreater-bay-area-china-s-booming-southern-mega-region)[Want to start a business in China?](https://www.dezshira.com/services/business-advisory?ENTRY=%252Fdoing-business-guide%252Fchina%252Fwhere-to-invest%252Fgreater-bay-area-china-s-booming-southern-mega-region)\n\nThe Greater Bay Area encompasses nine cities in the Pearl River Delta, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Zhaoqing, as well as two Special Administrative Regions, Hong Kong and Macao.

It is a key player in the manufacturing and financial services industries, with a particular focus on the automotive and petrochemical sectors. Shenzhen, located just across the border from Hong Kong, is known as China's Silicon Valley and is home to some of the world's most prominent technology companies.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nHong Kong and Macao are both Special Administrative Regions of China and are significant financial centers in their right.

The present stage is of monumental value, because we are halfway through the innovative policy of \"one country, two systems\" proposed by Deng Xiaoping, the inventor of the policy, \"not to be shaken for at least 50 years\". It is necessary to sort out the opportunities and challenges of \"one country, two systems\" at this stage.The proposal of the Greater Bay Area Strategy and the design and implementation of relevant policies undoubtedly provide a more intuitive \"microscope\" for us to observe and evaluate \"one country, two systems\". Discussing the opportunities and challenges of \"one country, two systems\" in the context of the Greater Bay Area will crystallize these concepts, and even non-scholars can understand them, which is the motivation of this paper.The framework for this article is very simple. First of all, I will make use of relevant literature to sort out the research status of \"one country, two systems\" under the Greater Bay Area. Then, on this basis, I’ll discuss the unique advantages that the institutional differences under \"one country, two systems\" bring to the construction of the Greater Bay Area and the difficulties that need innovation to overcome. Based on these opportunities and challenges, this paper puts forward suggestions for the follow-up development of the Greater Bay Area, hoping to provide some inspiration for the advance assumptions of policy design. \n\n# Key Wor ds \n\nGBA,One Country-Two Systems,Policy Design,Belt and Road,Socialist Capitalism,Free Market 1.Intr oduction \n\nAs one of the representatives of regional economic cooperation, GBA has its particularity compared with other regional economic collaborative development regions in China, such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and Yangtze River Delta. Since GBA includes two special administrative regions, Hong Kong and Macao, and implements different capitalist systems in the two SARs from mainland China, GBA has become a precedent for innovative and pioneering regional economic cooperation worldwide. Everything has two sides. The difference of systems under \"one country, two systems\" has brought unique advantages to the development of GBA that other urban agglomerations in the world do not have, enabling the Greater Bay Area to make use of the advantages of the two systems at the same time to complement each other and achieve the best integration. However, when policies are implemented, differences and even contradictions may occur between Guangdong Province and Hong Kong and Macao due to inappropriate connection between different systems and blank policy connection. If not properly handled, these contradictions may lead to deviation between the development of GBA and policy planning. This paper will analyze the unique advantages and differences caused by institutional differences under \"one country, two systems\", and try to put forward suggestions on how to skillfully use institutional differences to serve the construction of GBA, so as to make the two systems more smoothly connected. \n\n# 2.Liter atur e Review \n\nLi et al.(2019) pointed out that as one of the regional cooperation in urban agglomeration, the GBA's inherent \"one country, two systems\" provided advantages for its development. They linked the significance of GBA to the Belt and Road Initiative led by China and pointed out that GBA plays an important role in China's integration into international trade cooperation and the establishment of international economic status, which is a key change from the previous positioning of the Pearl River Delta region.Li et al.(2020) took Shenzhen Qianhai Pilot Zone as an example to analyze the disconnection and disunity of standards caused by system differences in the practice of \"one country, two systems\" policy in GBA, and introduced the management adjustments made in response to these difficulties. In terms of law, finance and service, the experience of Qianhai Pilot Zone can provide inspiration and reference for suggestions on maximizing the advantages of institutional differences in this paper.Li et al.(2017) pointed out that Hong Kong, as the second system of \"one country, two systems\", provided institutional supplement and more diverse perspectives for the economic development of GBA and even the whole country. Of course, all this was on the premise of \"one country\". They believe that Hong Kong and Mainland China should agree to develop together as a whole while adopting a different system. This is especially true within GBA.Yu, Hong.(2021) analyzed that Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in GBA are in fact competing with each other because they belong to different customs districts and administrative regions, which makes it challenging for them to build common goals and highly cooperate. This is an obstacle to the economic integration and collaborative development of GBA caused by the division of systems and management modes.Peck, Jamie.(2021) regarded GBA as the best test ground for combining the \"free market\" represented by Hong Kong and Macao with the \"state capitalism\" of Mainland China, and believed that GBA needs to build a new political and economic scale to transcend the gap between the two systems.Chan, Fung.(2020) concluded that Hong Kong's integration into GBA is inevitable, because its positioning is to show the world the possibility and feasibility of economic cooperation between capitalist economy and Mainland China. In this process, measures such as information sharing and allowing stakeholders to carry out discussions can reduce the resistance to the integration of GBA and make the two systems more smoothly combine and integrate.Sun et al.(2020) takes GBA as the research area to analyze the starting point and growth rate of development of cities within GBA. This provides reference information for the discussion of the development gap between GBA cities under the difference of system and the function positioning of synergistic development.Hui et al.(2020) believes that solid infrastructure and strong transportation capacity promote the flow of elements within GBA and play an important role in promoting GBA's regional integration. In this context, it can be inferred that the construction and improvement of infrastructure will help cities within GBA transcend the gap of institutional differences. Overcome resistance to development caused by institutional differences.Weng et al.(2020) tries to provide suggestions for GBA's city positioning and policy improvement by calculating and studying the carrying capacity of cities within GBA. GBA is a representative urban agglomeration in China, and the carrying capacity of each city can provide reference for this paper to summarize the development suggestions under the institutional differences and overcome the related problems caused by the institutional differences. \n\n# 3.Complementar y Advantages under Institutional Differ ences \n\n3.1 The \" Socialist Mar ket Economy\" in Mainland China --The Fir m Backing of The Development of GBA \n\nMainland China implements the socialist system, and its economic system is particularly different from that of Hong Kong and Macao. Although they all follow the law of market economy, the market economy in mainland China is more government-led. Economic development follows the law of market, but the government takes the leading advantage in the economy and has a strong initiative to regulate the economy, which can ensure that the country's economic development is controlled within the normal track. In the development of GBA, Guangdong province, as the representative of implementing the socialist market economic system, plays the role of strong reserve for the economic development of GBA. Due to the strong financial dominance of the state, GBA can have sufficient infrastructure investment and construction, such as the construction of cross-border railway and the planning of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, which are all promoted under the state's leadership. The socialist economic system provides solid support and foundation for regional economic development. And when markets fail, as they usually do in emergencies, governments can take the first step to remedy them. For example, in the era of COVID-19, market failure and economic stagnation have often occurred. When the society is at a standstill due to emergencies, the government is responsible for the unified allocation of resources and the guarantee of minimum living expenses to keep the society running. The most direct manifestation of the advantages of a socialist market economy is that Shenzhen recently used a seven-day period to eliminate the risk of infection, all in a unified arrangement by the government. In the future, Shenzhen's experience can serve as an example for cities in GBA to deal with epidemic risks. This is the institutional advantage of the socialist system reflected in the development of GBA. At the same time, as a region implementing socialist market economy, Guangdong province can provide insurance for the development of \"free market\" dominated economic model for Hong Kong and Macao, so that the two places have enough reserves and capacity to cope with market failure. \n\n# 3.2 The \" Fr ee Mar ket\" System of Capitalism in Hong Kong And Macao Pr ovides Space for GBA to Connect China with The Wor ld \n\nSince Hong Kong and Macao still kept their local system and social life unchanged after their return to China, it means that they are still institutionally \"Western\". Compared with the \"socialist\" market economy model in Mainland China, which is not familiar to western countries, Hong Kong and Macao have become a window for foreign investment in China. As they both belong to the capitalist economic system, foreign investment will trust the economic model of Hong Kong and Macao more in the initial stage of investment. This makes these two SAR's play a special and irreplaceable key role in the development of GBA, connecting China and the world. Moreover, SAR's independent legal system is a big reason for attracting foreign investment. Independent judicial system can provide convenience and guarantee for foreign enterprises to pay taxes and accept management, so that they have greater profit space and development prospects. As an international financial centre, Hong Kong also plays an important role as a hub for financial markets and international trade cooperation in GBA. The practice of GBA has forced Guangdong province and Hong Kong and Macao to carry out very close integration, which is a kind of innovative social experiment. The integration model of Guangdong Province and Hong Kong and Macao explored by GBA can provide examples and references for countries around the world to carry out close trade cooperation and financial circulation with Mainland China, and at the same time speed up China's integration into the world economy, so that China's socialist market economy is more and more recognized internationally. At the same time, due to its special geographical location and policy implications, GBA plays a leading and promoting role in the China-led Belt and Road Initiative, which complement each other and together become an important part of China's national development strategy. \n\n# 4.Inconveniences And Differ ences Br ought by Institutional Differ ences in \" One Countr y, Two Systems\" -- Challenges to The Development of GBA 4.1 Tax And Legal Differ ences -- Ar bitr age in Gr ey Ar eas \n\nDue to the differences between Hong Kong, Macao and the Mainland in taxation, legislation and justice, there are blank areas of supervision in related business management, trade supervision and other affairs. We can regard the areas where the legislation of the two systems is not properly connected as gray areas, which provide possibilities for speculation and arbitrage activities. For example, due to differences in tax systems, the prices of goods in Hong Kong and Macao are different from those in the Mainland. As a result, many people work in cross-border smuggling to earn the price difference, forming the phenomenon of \"water passengers\" in GBA, which disrupts the market order. Companies are also one of the subjects of speculation using laws and tax systems. Due to the differences in taxation policies between Hong Kong and Macao and the Mainland, some enterprises take advantage of the differences in the system to avoid tax arbitrage speculation. \n\n# 4.2 Institutional Differ ences Have Led to Uneven Responses to COVID-19 \n\nFree customs clearance between Hong Kong and the Mainland and Macao has been suspended for more than two years, which has made the actual development of GBA lag behind the strategic layout and policy intentions. The Chinese Mainland has adopted a \"cask theory\" to protect the weakest under the \"socialist\" system, which can be interpreted as a \"dynamic zero clearance\" with Chinese characteristics to protect the safety of its people at the expense of economic growth. So far, most countries in the world have adopted a policy of opening their doors to the outside world and unrestricted daily activities, which is what Hong Kong is implementing. What we can tell is that Hong Kong, Mainland China and Macao have embarked on different anti-epidemic paths. Such differences will deepen divisions within GBA and cause inconvenience and obstacles to exchanges between Hong Kong and other cities in GBA. The choice of the road to fight the epidemic actually comes from the differences in economic systems. As Mainland China is a government-led economic model, the government has the authority and ability to allocate and supplement resources in the face of social emergencies, so that the society can maintain operation even when partial production stops. However, as a capitalist market economy, Hong Kong follows the principle of \"free market\". Under such a system, the losses caused by compulsory regulation of market activities are unbearable and may even cause collateral damage to the society and public opinion. Due to differences in core institutional concepts, it is difficult for Hong Kong and the Mainland to reach a consensus on anti-epidemic policies. The policy inconsistency will lead to a long period of free customs clearance, which will seriously consume the cost of the preliminary construction of the Greater Bay Area and make the implementation of GBA strategy difficult. \n\n# 5.Possible Solutions&Conclusion \n\nIn view of the inconveniences of policy implementation caused by institutional differences in GBA, the government has also paid attention to and taken corresponding policies and measures to solve the relevant problems. For example, in order to promote mutual legal exchange and mutual trust in law enforcement within GBA, lawyers from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao can obtain practicing qualifications in GBA by taking the practice examination. In order to reduce smuggling and arbitrage, Guangdong province has cooperated with the Exit and Entry Authorities in Hong Kong and Macao to control the frequency of entry and exit for ordinary visas, so as to control smuggling activities of speculation and arbitrage. In order to promote the flow of human resources in GBA and make the functional positioning of each city clearer, Guangdong Province has issued corresponding policies on taxation and social insurance for employees from Hong Kong and Macao to minimize the differences caused by institutional differences. Although there are still management challenges and inconveniences caused by institutional differences in GBA, the corresponding adjustments made by the government are developing in a positive direction. In the past, most of the differences in management caused by institutional differences were targeted solutions after problems occurred. In order to minimize the obstacles in the development of GBA, the future policy adjustment can move the threshold forward, predict the possible problems and take possible solutions into account when designing policies, so as to change resolving differences into preventing problems, so as to gain initiative for the smooth development of GBA.

Its aim is to promote the safe and orderly cross-boundary flow of personal information within the GBA. The relevant facilitation measure will be implemented through administrative arrangements by the Digital Policy Office (DPO) (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer).\n\n**The facilitation measure of the GBA Standard Contract is now extended to all sectors of industries, promoting more cross-boundary services to benefit the public and businesses while facilitating data flow throughout the GBA.** Individuals or organisations who have the need to arrange cross-boundary flow of personal information between Mainland and Hong Kong within the Greater Bay Area are encouraged to adopt the GBA Standard Contract and file with the Digital Policy Office in Hong Kong.\n\n1.   **What is the GBA Standard Contract?**\n\nAdopted on a voluntary basis, the GBA Standard Contract refers to the contract entered into between the Personal Information Processor 1 and Recipient when conducting cross-boundary flow of personal information within the GBA. It is a pre-designed contract template that outlines the obligations and responsibilities of both contractual parties in protecting the personal information being transferred across the boundary. Individuals and organisations of both Hong Kong and the nine Mainland cities in the GBA (namely, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing) may enter into a GBA Standard Contract, in accordance with the [“Implementation Guidelines on the GBA Standard Contract”](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf), to facilitate the flow of personal information 2 between the nine Mainland cities and Hong Kong (i.e., flow of the personal information from the aforesaid nine Mainland cities in the GBA to Hong Kong, and vice versa).\n\n* * *\n\n1 Under the GBA Standard Contract, for the Mainland China, the “Personal Information Processor” refers to an organisation or individual who, in the course of personal information processing activities, decide on their own the purpose and the manner of processing. For the HKSAR, it also refers to a “data user” who, either alone or jointly or in common with other persons, controls the collection, holding, processing or use of the data.\n\n2 Under the GBA Standard Contract, the personal information being processed by Personal Information Processors in the Mainland within the GBA, is defined in accordance with the Personal Information Protection Law of the Mainland China. Personal information being processed by Personal Information Processors in the HKSAR is defined in accordance with the interpretation of “personal data” under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance of the HKSAR.\n\n2.   **Benefits of the GBA Standard Contract**\n\nThe GBA Standard Contract streamlines the compliance arrangement of cross-boundary data flow for enterprises, thus facilitating the provision of relevant cross-boundary services in the GBA and bringing convenience to the public and business. It can lower the cost of compliance arrangement in data flow, which further promotes the digital economy and research development in the Greater Bay Area. It also solids the growth of Hong Kong into an Innovation hub and its integration into the GBA region and complement national development.\n\nWith the facilitation measure in place, the key assessment areas of Personal Information Protection Impact Assessment (PIA) in the GBA Standard Contract are simplified from six to three areas. The GBA Standard Contract, also, lifts the restriction on the volume of cross-boundary flow of personal data that a Personal Information Processor can transfer under the Mainland’s framework. The filing process for the GBA Standard Contract is also shortened to 10 working days. Thus simplifying the assessment areas and saving time and cost. Meanwhile, the processing and export of personal data from Hong Kong will continue to be regulated in accordance with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance of Hong Kong\n\n3.   **Role to Play in Cross-Boundary Data Flow**\n\nThe contractual parties either play the role as the Personal Information Processor or the Recipient in the cross-boundary flow of personal information. Both parties need to comply with the relevant administrative measures, perform filings to protect personal information against risks and safeguard the safe and orderly flow of personal information across the boundary.\n\nThe Personal Information Processor may provide personal information across the boundary upon a legal and necessary business need. Prior to that, the Personal Information Processor must be in accordance with the law of its jurisdiction to get the consent of the personal information subject. The Personal Information Processor also need to conduct the Personal Information Protection Impact Assessment (PIA) within 3 months before the filing date. By entering into the GBA Standard Contract, the personal information provided across the boundary shall not be transferred to any organisation or individual outside the GBA, including the group of companies, no matter it is the parent or subsidiary corporations of organisation that are situated outside Hong Kong.\n\nThe Recipient is the receiver of personal information across the boundary. The Recipient is required to ensure the retention period of personal information shall be the minimum time necessary to achieve the purpose of processing. Upon expiry of the retention period, the personal information shall be erased. The Recipient is also required to put in place the technical and management measures to ensure the security of personal information. According to the GBA Standard Contract, the Recipient **should not provide personal information to any organisation or individual outside the Greater Bay Area, including to a third party** or the group of companies, no matter it is the parent or subsidiary corporations of organisation that are situated outside Hong Kong. It needs to be in the same jurisdiction of the Recipient, which is, registered or located in the nine Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area or Hong Kong.\n\n[](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/gbacbdf/cross-boundary_data_flow/index.html)**Video on “Introduction to the GBA Standard Contract”**\n\n[![Image 1: Introduction to the GBA Standard Contract](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/images/Thumbnail_Introduction_EN.png)](https://youtu.be/Y7gSfKLomcg \"Introduction to the GBA Standard Contract\")\n\n[Cantonese](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/tc/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/gbacbdf/cross-boundary_data_flow/index.html#Video_introduction) or [Putonghua version](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/sc/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/gbacbdf/cross-boundary_data_flow/index.html#Video_introduction)\n\n4.

The contractual parties shall enter into a GBA Standard Contract based on the templates of the [GBA Standard Contract](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_a1_tc_en.docx) and [Undertaking](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_a2_tc_en.docx)\n\n        *   By adopting the GBA Standard Contract, the Personal Information Processor and the Recipient are subject to different obligations and responsibilities. Therefore, each GBA Standard Contract is only applicable to cross-boundary flow of personal information from the nine Mainland cities within the GBA to Hong Kong and vice versa. If there is a need to transfer personal information to and from Hong Kong and the nine Mainland cities in the GBA, the contractual parties need to sign two sets of GBA Standard Contracts, that is one set for Hong Kong company as the Personal Information Processor, Mainland partner as the Recipient; and another one set for Mainland partner as the Personal Information Processor, and Hong Kong company as the Recipient.\n\n    2.   **Filing of the GBA Standard Contract in Hong Kong**\n\nThe Personal Information Processor and the Recipient of Hong Kong shall conduct the filing procedures with the Digital Policy Office (DPO) (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO)) within 10 working days from the effective date of the GBA Standard Contract (that is the signing date of the GBA Standard Contract) and be held responsible for the authenticity of the documents filed.\n\n        \nThe Personal Information Processor or the Recipient of Hong Kong can choose to submit documents to us by the following means:\n\n        1.

What are the benefits of entering the Memorandum between Hong Kong and the Mainland?**\n\n*   The National 14th Five-Year Plan promulgated solid support for Hong Kong’s development as an international innovation and technology hub. Facilitating data flow in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (“GBA”) is an important initiative for promoting the high quality development of the GBA, which is conducive to promoting the development of digital economy and smart city in the GBA. To this end, the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau (ITIB) and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) entered into the “Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area” (“the Memorandum”) on 29 June 2023 to foster cross-boundary data flow in the GBA in a safe and orderly manner under the national management framework. The signing of the Memorandum is iconic and a policy breakthrough. It will facilitate enterprises in the GBA and streamline the compliance arrangements for conducting cross-boundary flow of data. Meanwhile, the export of data from Hong Kong will continue to be regulated in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong.\n\n1.   **What is the “Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)”?**\n\n*   The “Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (“the GBA Standard Contract”), is a facilitation measure formulated jointly by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau (ITIB) under the “Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area” aiming to facilitate the cross-boundary flow of personal information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The adoption of the GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis. It allows individuals and organisations in the Mainland cities within the GBA and Hong Kong to enter into a GBA Standard Contract based on a standardised contract with both contractual parties’ responsibilities and obligations in protecting personal information under the regulations.\n*   The GBA Standard Contract refers to the contract entered into between Personal Information Processors and the Recipients when conducting cross-boundary flow of personal information within the Greater Bay Area. The GBA Standard Contract comprises both contractual parties’ responsibilities and obligations, the rights of personal information subjects and related remedies, the termination of a contract, the liability for breach of contract, and other matters.\n\n1.   **Under what circumstances of the cross-boundary transfer of personal information will the “GBA Standard Contract” be applicable?**\n\n*   The GBA Standard Contract is a facilitation measure to promote the cross-boundary flow of personal information in the Greater Bay Area. Adoption of the GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis. The Personal Information Processors and the Recipients should be registered (applicable to organisations)/located (applicable to individuals) in the Greater Bay Area, that is, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing in the Guangdong Province, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. By entering into the GBA Standard Contract, they may conduct cross-boundary flow of personal information from the nine Mainland cities within the GBA to Hong Kong, and vice versa.\n\n1.   **What are the edges of Hong Kong regarding cross-boundary data flow? What are the benefits of implementing the GBA Standard Contract?**\n\n*   Data is the key element for promoting innovation and high-quality development. The HKSAR government recognises the strategic role of data in promoting the development of smart city and digital economy.\n*   Under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle, Hong Kong allows free flow of information and possesses a sound legal system and its edges in infrastructure investments, financing and Fintech which are conducive to the convergence of global information hub. Meanwhile, Hong Kong is set to leverage the unique advantage of “convergence” of data from the Mainland and overseas, thus providing important elements for the development of smart city and digital economy. In parallel, the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance of Hong Kong has set clear regulations on protecting the privacy and security of personal data. This provides an important legal basis for protection of cross boundary flow of personal data to Hong Kong and enhances the credibility and reliability of data flows.\n*   Further on the integration of cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA), the demand for data flow between Hong Kong and other cities in the GBA is increasing. Under the “Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow Within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area”, the Government of HKSAR and the Cyberspace Administration of China jointly introduce the GBA Standard Contract facilitation measure. With the implementation of the facilitation measure, the compliance arrangements of cross-boundary data flow for enterprises would be greatly streamlined, thereby facilitating the provision of relevant cross-boundary services in the GBA and bringing convenience to the public and businesses.\n\n1.   **Can the content of the GBA Standard Contract be altered based on the commercial considerations of both parties?**\n\n*   No. The GBA Standard Contract shall be entered into strictly in accordance with the “Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract”, [templates of the GBA Standard Contract](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_a1_tc_en.docx) and [Undertaking](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_a2_tc_en.docx), and cross-boundary personal information transfer shall only be conducted after the GBA Standard Contract has come into effect. Personal Information Processor may agree on other terms with the Recipient, but such terms shall not be in conflict with the GBA Standard Contract. If there is any conflict between the GBA Standard Contract and any other legal documents conducted by both parties, the terms of the GBA Standard Contract shall prevail.\n\n1.   **What procedures are required for adopting the GBA Standard Contract?**\n\n*   Adoption of the GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis. Prior to the cross-boundary transfers of personal information by entering into GBA Standard Contract, the Personal Information Processor shall conduct a personal information protection impact assessment and complete it within 3 months before the filing date.\n*   The Personal Information Processor and the Recipient shall, according to its jurisdiction concerned, conduct the filing procedures of the GBA Standard Contract with the Cyberspace Administration of Guangdong Province and the Digital Policy Office (DPO) (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO)) respectively within 10 working days from the effective date of the GBA Standard Contract (that is the signing date of the GBA Standard Contract). For details, please refer to the [“Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract”](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf).\n\n1.   **What should Personal Information Processors (including data users) and Recipients pay attention to when adopting the GBA Standard Contract for cross-boundary flow of personal information?**\n\n*   Adoption of the GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis. The Personal Information Processor and the Recipient shall understand and observe the [“Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract”](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf) and the [GBA Standard Contract](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_a1_tc_en.docx), including conditions and requirements for entering into the contract, management procedures, etc. The Personal Information Processor or the Recipient of Hong Kong shall voluntarily undertake to be supervised and managed by the Digital Policy Office (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer).\n*   The Personal Information Processor and the Recipient who had entered into the GBA Standard Contract shall fulfill the obligations and responsibilities set out in the contract and undertake the responsibilities to protect personal information concerned. Meanwhile, the processing and export of personal data from Hong Kong will continue to be regulated in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong, including the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.\n\n1.   **Is the GBA Standard Contract applicable to the cross-boundary flow of personal information between Hong Kong and Macau?**\n\n*   Currently the GBA Standard Contract is only applicable to cross-boundary flow of personal information between the nine Mainland cities within the GBA (i.e. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing) and Hong Kong, Macau is not included in the scope.\n\n1.   **Our Mainland partner (registered in Mainland cities within the GBA) is planning to provide personal information of citizens who are located in Mainland cities outside the GBA (e.g., Beijing, Shanghai, etc.). Can my organisation (registered in Hong Kong) adopt the GBA Standard Contract to receive such personal information?**\n\n*   In adoption of the GBA Standard Contract, the Personal Information Processors and the Recipients must be registered (applicable to organisations)/located (applicable to individuals) in the nine Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area, that is, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing in the Guangdong Province. If your Mainland partners are registered (applicable to organisations)/located (applicable to individuals) in the above-mentioned regions, you may consider adopting the facilitation measure of “GBA Standard Contract” for cross-boundary flow of personal information.\n*   According to the GBA Standard Contract, personal information being processed by Personal Information Processors in the Mainland cities of the Greater Bay Area, is determined in accordance with the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China.\n\n1.   **My organisation and our Mainland partners have entered into a standard contract for personal information transfer activities in accordance with the Measures on the Standard Contract for Export of Personal Information (“Measures on Standard Contract”). Do we need to re-enter the “Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (“GBA Standard Contract”) for conducting cross boundary flow in the Greater Bay Area?**\n\n*   The “GBA Standard Contract” facilitation measure aims to streamline the compliance arrangements for the cross-boundary flow of personal information in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and its adoption is on a voluntary basis.\n*   The “Measures on Standard Contract” and the “GBA Standard Contract” facilitation measure are two different arrangements. While the scope of application, requirements, restrictions and management framework, etc., of the “Measures on Standard Contract” and the “GBA Standard Contract” facilitation measure are different, individuals or organisations that conduct cross-boundary transfers of personal information may consider adopting the “Measures on Standard Contract” and/or the “GBA Standard Contract” facilitation measure based on actual circumstances and needs. It is advised to consult legal or professional advice if necessary.\n\n1.   **Due to business needs, my organisation (registered in Hong Kong) needs to transfer customers’ personal information to our partners in Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area. Is it a must to adopt the GBA Standard Contract?**\n\n*   According to the “Guidance on Cross-Boundary Data Transfer: Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” issued by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data of Hong Kong (PCPD), for cross-boundary transfer of personal data within the Greater Bay Area, the PCPD recommends eligible Personal Information Processors and Recipients in the Greater Bay Area to adopt GBA Standard Contract.\n*   The adoption of GBA Standard Contract is on a voluntary basis. Individuals or organisations that conduct cross-boundary transfers of personal information may consider adopting GBA Standard Contract based on actual circumstances and needs. It is advised to consult legal or professional advice if necessary.\n\n1.   **What should I do if a Personal Information Processor (covers data user) and/or Recipient are found failed to fulfill the obligations and responsibilities as specified in the “Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract and / or the GBA Standard Contract?**\n\n*   If any organisation or individual discovers that a Personal Information Processor or a Recipient that conducts cross-boundary flow of personal information within the Greater Bay Area in accordance with [“Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract”](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf) and / or the GBA Standard Contract fails to fulfill its obligations and responsibilities required, they may file a complaint or report to the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Cyberspace Administration of Guangdong Province or the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the Digital Policy Office (DPO) (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO)) and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data Hong Kong (PCPD).\n*   Upon receipt of complaints or reports, the DPO (or the then OGCIO) shall handle them in accordance with the “Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract”, if necessary, the DPO (or the then OGCIO) shall request the Personal Information Processor or the Recipient to make necessary rectification in case. The DPO (or the then OGCIO) shall work closely with the PCPD, when handling the case.\n*   The PCPD will perform their supervisory and management roles under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, including handling complaints, reports, investigations, and handling of illegal personal data processing activities.\n\n1.   **My Mainland partner is not registered in the Greater Bay Area. Can we adopt the “GBA Standard Contract”?**\n\n*   No. To adopt the GBA Standard Contract, the Personal Information Processors and the Recipients should be registered in the Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area, i.e., Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing in the Guangdong Province, or the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).\n\n1.   **The GBA Standard Contract aims to facilitate cross-boundary flow of personal information in the Greater Bay Area. Will this, in disguise, encourage or cause data users in Hong Kong to transfer the personal data of Hong Kong citizens to Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area?**\n\n*   The GBA Standard Contract is a facilitation measure to promote the cross-boundary flow of personal information in the Greater Bay Area and its adoption is on a voluntary basis. Meanwhile, the processing and export of personal data from Hong Kong will continue to be regulated in accordance with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) of Hong Kong.\n*   Besides, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) had participated to formulate the GBA Standard Contract and provided professional advices in order to ensure the implementation of cross-boundary flow of personal information to the nine Mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area under the GBA Standard Contract shall fulfill the regulations under the PDPO.\n*   The GBA Standard Contract is a facilitation measure being implemented through administrative arrangements by the Digital Policy Office, it does not affect the PCPD in performing their supervisory and management roles under the PDPO.\n\n1.   **My organisation (registered in Hong Kong) has already entered into the GBA Standard Contract with our Mainland partner for the cross-boundary flow of personal information. Do we or our Mainland partner need to conduct the filing procedures?**\n\n*   According to the [“Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract”](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf), the Personal Information Processor and the Recipient **(i.e., both contractual parties) are required to conduct the filing procedures of the GBA Standard Contract** within 10 working days from the effective date of the GBA Standard Contract (that is the signing date of the GBA Standard Contract).\n*   The contractual party (whether as a Personal Information Processor or a Recipient) registered / located in Hong Kong shall conduct the filing procedures with the DPO (or the then OGCIO). For details, please refer to the [Steps of Commencing Cross-Boundary Data Flow in the GBA](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/gbacbdf/cross-boundary_data_flow/index.html#steps).\n*   The contractual party (whether as a Personal Information Processor or a Recipient) registered / located in the nine Mainland cities within the GBA (i.e. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing) shall conduct the filing procedures with the GDCAC. For details, please refer to the [Announcement by Cyberspace Administration of Guangdong Province on Facilitation measure on “Standard Contract for Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information Within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (Chinese only)](https://www.cagd.gov.cn/v/2024/01/4401.html).\n\n1.   **It is noted that our Mainland partner (as Personal Information Processor) has conducted the filing procedures in Mainland as required. Do we still need to conduct the filing procedures as a Recipient in Hong Kong?**\n\n*   Yes. In accordance with the [“Implementation Guidelines of the GBA Standard Contract”](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc00_gn_scc_en.pdf) the Personal Information Processor and the Recipient shall, according to the jurisdiction concerned, conduct the filing procedures with the Cyberspace Administration of Guangdong Province and the Digital Policy Office (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer) of the HKSAR Government respectively within 10 working days from the effective date of the GBA Standard Contract (that is the signing date of the GBA Standard Contract). For details, please refer to the [“Filing Guidelines on Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)”](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc02_fg_en.pdf).\n\n1.   **My organisation (registered in Hong Kong) and our Mainland partner are planning to conduct cross-boundary of personal information from Mainland to Hong Kong and vice versa. Do we need to sign TWO (2) sets of GBA Standard Contract to serve the purposes?**\n\n*   Yes, by adopting the GBA Standard Contract, the Personal Information Processor and the Recipient are subject to different obligations and responsibilities. Therefore, each set of GBA Standard Contract is only applicable to cross-boundary flow of personal information from the nine Mainland cities within the GBA to Hong Kong or vice versa. \n\n1.   **Can we adopt one (1) set of GBA Standard Contract for all personal data, which covers multiple business aspects, of my organisation?**\n\n*   The adoption of GBA Standard Contract covers personal information of multiple business aspects and scenarios, such as loan business, syndication, or wealth management, etc., of banking industry, of the same organisation. With a view to save the efforts in entering into several contracts for multiple scenarios, an organisation can adopt one set of GBA Standard Contract covering all scenarios of cross-boundary transfer of personal information, provided that the concerned Personal Information Processor and the Recipient as well as purposes on cross-boundary transfer of personal information are same in these business scenarios.\n\n1.   **The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced the “Provisions on Promoting and Regulating Cross-border Data Flow (the Provisions)” on 22 March 2024. Under the Provisions, are Personal Information Processors still required to adopt the “Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (“the GBA Standard Contract”)?**\n\n*   On 22 March 2024, the CAC announced the Provisions which lifted certain restrictions on conducting cross-border data transfer from the Mainland with a view to facilitate cross-boundary data flow under the national regime of protecting data security. The Provisions lifted certain restrictions regarding the need of entering into “Standard contract for cross-border transfer of personal information”, which are applicable to the GBA Standard Contract.\n\n1.   **If data has been transferred to Hong Kong, can it be viewed through internet beyond the GBA (for example Singapore or other cities)?**\n\n*   No. According to The GBA Standard Contract, Article 3 (7); Personal information received through the GBA Standard Contract should not be provided to organisations / individuals outside the GBA (including transfer; storage; access).\n\n*   Briefing on facilitation measure on “Standard Contract for the Cross-Boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (Chinese only) (10 December 2024)\n\n*    News report on facilitation measure on “Standard Contract for the Cross-Boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (2 December 2024) \n    *   Hong Kong Economic Journal\n    *   Ming Pao\n    *   Ta Kung Pao\n    *   Wen Wei Po\n\n*    PCPD’s seminar on “Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information Within the Greater Bay Area” (Chinese only) (9 April 2024) \n    *   [Digital Policy Office (or the then Office of the Government Chief Information Officer)’s presentation deck (Chinese only)](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/tc/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/20240409_OGCIO.pdf)\n    *   [Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data’s presentation deck (Chinese only)](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/tc/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/20240409_PCPD.pdf)\n\n*   [Briefing on facilitation measure on “Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)” (Chinese only) (13 December 2023)](https://www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/mainland/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/20231213_CBDF_Brief_materials.pdf)\n\nDigital Policy Office\n\n14/F, Treasury Building, No. 3 Tonkin Street West, Cheung Sha Wan, Kowloon, Hong Kong\n\n(852) 3847 7439\n\n(852) 2802 4549\n\n[enquiry@digitalpolicy.gov.hk](mailto:enquiry@digitalpolicy.gov.hk)\n\n2024 © Digital Policy Office\n\nLast Revision Date:\n\n13-08-2025\n",

Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate.\nLearn about our\neditorial policies (https://www.investopedia.com/legal-4768893#editorial-policy)\nClose\nSingapore's low taxes and other incentives for foreign investors qualify it as a\ntax haven (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxhaven.asp?o=40186&l=dir&qsrc=999&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&ap=investopedia.com)\n. Resident taxpayers pay a progressive tax on personal income. For tax year 2024 and beyond, the highest marginal rate is 24% for income above S$1 million.\n1\nSingapore generally doesn't tax capital gains.\n2\nNote that all figures in this article are quoted in\nSingapore dollars (SGD) (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sgd-singapore-dollar.asp)\n.\nThis kind of tax policy, and a location that makes it a gateway for companies that want to expand into emerging Asian economies, make this island city-state a global hub for international investment and commerce.\nKey Takeaways\nSingapore is lauded as a center for international trade and finance.\nIt is considered a tax haven with several favorable policies for people living and doing business there.\nThe country offers several tax breaks, boasts a relatively low corporate tax rate and top personal tax bracket, and does not levy taxes on capital gains.\nSingapore's Corporate Rates\nThe corporate income tax rate in Singapore is a flat 17%. However, the effective\ncorporate tax rate (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatetax.asp?o=40186&l=dir&qsrc=999&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&ap=investopedia.com)\ncould be lowered by other incentives introduced by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore.\n3\nStartups (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp)\nin Singapore can take advantage of a tax exemption of up to S$125,000 on the first S$200,000 of income for their first three consecutive years of business. To qualify for the startup tax exemption, companies must be incorporated in Singapore and have a maximum of 20 shareholders. If all shareholders are not individuals, then at least one shareholder must be an individual who holds a minimum of 10% of shares.\n3\nCompanies that have not previously claimed the Tax Exemption for New Start-Up Companies can claim the Partial Tax Exemption for Companies. This allows for an exemption of up to S$102,500 on the first S$200,000 of chargeable income.\n3\nFast Fact\nBetween tax years 2017 and 2023, the top marginal rate was 22%. The highest tax bracket was defined as income above S$320,000.\n1\nOther Tax Breaks\nSingapore also offers\ntax exemptions (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax_exempt.asp?o=40186&l=dir&qsrc=999&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&ap=investopedia.com)\nfor businesses in certain industries. These include breaks for qualifying foreign banks, offshore funds, and global trading companies.\nBanks are eligible for a withholding tax exemption on payments to non-resident companies made between April 1, 2011, and December 31, 2026, that are based on agreements that take effect between those dates.\n4\nQualifying offshore funds are also exempt from tax on some income, including income from dividends, gains, profits, and interest from traditional investments including deposits, bonds, shares, stocks, and securities.\n5\n6\n7\nGlobal trading companies are eligible for concessionary tax rates of 5%, 10%, and 15% for five years if they qualify for Singapore's Global Trader Programme. Singapore typically grants Global Trader status to companies with established track records in international trade.\n8\nOversight in Singapore\nBanks and financial institutions in the city-state are required to exercise\ndue diligence (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp)\nto help prevent\nmoney laundering (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneylaundering.asp?o=40186&l=dir&qsrc=999&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&ap=investopedia.com)\nand other international criminal activity.\n9\nUnder Singapore law, records are private. As such, financial institutions are not required to provide access to personal data about individuals.\n10\nHowever, Singapore provides exceptions to banking confidentiality agreements upon request by foreign authorities in cases where accounts were used to shield criminal activity.\n11\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates its financial institutions.\n12\nHow Stable Is Singapore's Economy?\nSingapore's economy is considered to be safe and stable. According to the World Bank, the nation functions on a \"high-income\" economy with strong investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and public services. Its regulatory environment is very business-friendly. Singapore's economic growth was 1.1% in 2023 and the country ranked among the top countries in human capital development.\n13\nHow Do I Invest in Singapore?\nThere are different ways to take advantage of Singapore's growth. You can invest directly in companies based in the island nation by trading stocks through a brokerage account. You can also purchase\nAmerican depositary receipts (ADRs) (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp)\nthat trade on domestic exchanges, shares of\nexchange-traded funds (ETFs) (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)\n, and/or mutual fund shares that have Singaporean companies and assets (like bonds) in their portfolios.\nWhat Is a Tax Haven?\nA tax haven is a jurisdiction that offers favorable tax treatment to individuals and corporations, specifically to those who don't permanently reside there. Tax havens may offer low tax rates, secrecy, asset protection, and financial privacy. They may also waive any residency requirements for favorable treatment. Some of the most common tax havens include the Cayman Islands, Switzerland, Bermuda, and Singapore.\nThe Bottom Line\nTax havens are often characterized by favorable tax treatment, especially when it comes to offshore corporations. This is one reason why Singapore is often considered to be one. Startups can take advantage of tax exemptions and capital gains are generally not taxed in the country. Singapore also provides financial privacy as long as there is no criminal activity suspected.\nCorrection—Oct. 20, 2022:\nThis article has been edited from a previous version that misstated the currency for the marginal income tax bracket in Singapore as United States Dollars instead of Singapore Dollars.\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Income\n-----------------------------\n\nForeign income refers to income derived from outside Singapore. Generally, such income is [taxable in Singapore](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/taxable-non-taxable-income \"taxable in Singapore\") when remitted to and received in Singapore. Where the foreign income arises from a trade or business carried on in Singapore, it is taxable in Singapore upon accrual, regardless of whether it is received in Singapore.\n\nIn many cases, foreign income is taxed twice - once in the foreign jurisdiction and a second time in Singapore.\n\nThere are tax reliefs available to Singapore tax residents to alleviate the double taxation suffered, such as:\n\n*   Exemption or reduction in tax imposed on specified foreign income that is derived in a jurisdiction that has an Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement with Singapore\n*   Tax exemption on specified foreign-sourced income such as foreign-sourced dividends, foreign branch profits and foreign-sourced service income under Section 13(8) of the Income Tax Act 1947\n*   Foreign tax credit for the taxes paid in the foreign jurisdiction against the Singapore tax payable on the same income\n\nExpand all\n\n[### Claiming Benefits under Avoidance of Double Tax Agreements](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income#claiming-benefits-under-avoidance-of-double-tax-agreements)\n\nAn Avoidance of Double Tax Agreement (DTA) is an agreement between Singapore and another jurisdiction (i.e. a DTA partner). It serves to relieve double taxation of income that is earned in 1 jurisdiction by a resident of the other jurisdiction.\n\nOnly Singapore tax residents and tax residents of the DTA partner can enjoy the benefits of a DTA. Find out who are our [DTA partners](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/international-tax/list-of-dtas-limited-dtas-and-eoi-arrangements).\n\n### Purpose of DTAs\n\nA DTA states the taxing rights between Singapore and her DTA partner on the different types of income arising from cross-border economic activities between the 2 jurisdictions.\n\nThe DTA also provides for reduction or exemption of tax on certain types of income.\n\n* * *\n\nWhere the benefit under the DTA is not an exemption of tax but a reduction of tax rate, the Singapore company may have to pay tax in both the foreign jurisdiction and Singapore.\n\nThe DTA provides relief for this double taxation by allowing the Singapore company to claim a credit of the foreign tax suffered against its Singapore tax payable on the same income.\n\nLearn more about this credit, also known as [Double Tax Relief](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-reliefs/foreign-tax-credit).\n\n* * *\n\n### For Singapore Tax Resident Companies\n\nSingapore tax resident companies can claim benefits under the DTA (i.e. the company is exempt from tax or subject to withholding tax at a reduced rate in the foreign jurisdiction) when they derive foreign income from a DTA partner.\n\nTo claim DTA benefits, the company must show the DTA partner that it is a tax resident of Singapore by:\n\n*   [Applying for a Certificate of Residence (COR)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/applying-for-a-certificate-of-residence-tax-reclaim-form)\n\nThis is a letter certifying that a company is a tax resident of Singapore for the purpose of claiming tax benefits under the DTAs.\n\n*   [Seeking IRAS’ certification of a tax reclaim form](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/applying-for-a-certificate-of-residence-tax-reclaim-form)\n\nThe DTA partner may require the company to submit a tax reclaim form issued by that jurisdiction together with or in place of a COR.\n\n### For Tax Resident Companies of our DTA Partners\n\nTax residents of our DTA partners can claim benefits under the DTA (i.e. the foreign company is exempt from tax or subject to withholding tax at a reduced rate in Singapore) when they derive income from Singapore.\n\nTo claim DTA benefits, they have to show IRAS that they are a tax resident of the DTA partner by submitting a completed Certificate of Residence that is duly certified by the tax authority of their country/ territory of residence.\n\nLearn how to [claim tax relief/ exemption under the DTA for non-resident companies](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-filing/claim-of-relief-under-the-avoidance-of-double-tax-agreement-(dta)).\n\n[### Tax Exemption on Specified Foreign-Sourced Income](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income#tax-exemption-on-specified-foreign-sourced-income)\n\nSingapore tax resident companies may enjoy tax exemption on specified foreign-sourced income that is remitted into Singapore.\n\n### Scope of Specified Foreign-Sourced Income\n\nForeign-sourced income is foreign income that does not arise from a trade or business carried on in Singapore.\n\nThe 3 categories of specified foreign-sourced income are:\n\n*   Foreign-sourced dividend\n*   Foreign branch profits\n*   Foreign-sourced service income\n\n### Qualifying Conditions for Tax Exemption\n\nUnder Section 13(9) of the Income Tax Act 1947, tax exemption is granted when **all**of the following 3 conditions are met:\n\n1.   The foreign income has been subject to tax in the foreign jurisdiction from which it is received (known as the '[subject to tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income#subjectToTax)' condition). The rate at which the foreign income was taxed can be different from the headline tax rate;\n2.   The highest Corporate Income Tax rate (i.e. [foreign headline tax rate](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income#foreignHeadline) condition) of the foreign jurisdiction from which the income is received is at least 15% at the time the foreign income is received in Singapore; and\n3.   The Comptroller of Income Tax is satisfied that the tax exemption is beneficial to the Singapore tax resident company.\n\n#### 'Subject to Tax' Condition\n\nTo meet this condition, the specified foreign income received in Singapore must have been subject to tax in the foreign country/ territory from which the income is received.\n\n* * *\n\n##### For Substantive Business Activities\n\nThe Comptroller of Income Tax will regard the ‘subject to tax’ condition as met if the income is exempt from tax in the foreign jurisdiction due to tax incentive(s) granted for substantive business activities carried out in that jurisdiction.\n\nThe following documents must be prepared and [retained for at least 5 years](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements) from the relevant Year of Assessment (YA):\n\n*   A declaration by the company that the foreign jurisdiction has exempted the foreign income from tax because of substantive business activities carried out by the company in that jurisdiction\n*   A copy of the tax incentive certificate/ approval letter issued by the foreign jurisdiction. In the case of a foreign-sourced dividend, a dividend voucher (if available) stating that the dividend is exempt from tax due to tax incentive granted to the dividend-paying company for carrying out substantive business activities in that foreign jurisdiction is sufficient\n\n* * *\n\n##### For Foreign-Sourced Dividends\n\nFor the purpose of this ‘subject to tax’ condition, tax paid or payable on foreign-sourced dividend received in Singapore includes:\n\n*   The dividend tax, which is income tax levied on the dividend by the foreign country/ territory of source\n*   The underlying tax, which is income tax paid or payable by the dividend paying company on the income out of which the dividend is paid\n\nThe following documents must be prepared to substantiate that the underlying tax has been paid on the income out of which the foreign-sourced dividend is paid:\n\n*   **Audited accounts of the foreign dividend paying company**\n\nTo demonstrate that its foreign-sourced dividend has suffered underlying tax, the company can provide the audited accounts of the foreign dividend paying company for the financial period ending in the year before the year the dividend is received in Singapore. The accounts must show a positive current year tax (excluding deferred tax expense).\n\nIRAS is also prepared to accept the consolidated accounts of the foreign dividend paying company and its group companies as proof that the ‘subject to tax’ condition has been met. However, the foreign dividend paying company must be:\n\n*   A company listed on a stock exchange; and\n*   An operating company carrying out substantive business activities (investment holding is excluded). This must be supported by evidence such as description in the consolidated accounts or any official publication showing the principal activities of the foreign dividend paying company to be such (as opposed to the Group).\n\nThe consolidated accounts of the foreign dividend paying company and its group companies for the financial period ending in the year before the year the dividend is received in Singapore must show a positive current year tax (excluding deferred expense).\n\nFor example, if the dividend is received in Singapore on 30 Jun 2023, the consolidated accounts of the foreign dividend paying company and its group companies for the financial year 2022 must show a positive current year tax.\n\n*   **Alternative documents accepted**\n\nIRAS also accepts the following documents to show that the income of the foreign dividend paying company has been subject to tax:\n\n*   A certification from the bank through which the taxpayer invested into the foreign dividend paying company\n*   A confirmation letter from the foreign dividend paying company that foreign tax has been paid on the income out of which dividends are paid\n\nIf you are unable to secure any proof that tax has been paid on the income of the foreign dividend paying company, the ‘subject to tax’ condition will not be considered met.\n\nThe relevant information/ documents must be [retained for at least 5 years](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements) from the relevant YA.\n\nIRAS may review and modify the use of alternative documents should there be any cases of abuse.\n\n* * *\n\n#### 'Foreign Headline Tax Rate of at least 15%' Condition\n\nDividend is considered to be sourced in the jurisdiction that the dividend paying company is tax resident of. Where the dividend paying company is a non-Singapore tax resident, the dividend is considered foreign-sourced.\n\nForeign-sourced dividend may be paid by a company listed on the stock exchange in 1 jurisdiction (e.g. Hong Kong) but tax resident of another jurisdiction (e.g. Bermuda). Hence, it cannot be presumed that the jurisdiction of the listing of the dividend paying company is where the dividend is sourced.\n\nWhere a dividend paying company is incorporated outside the jurisdiction where it is listed, the Comptroller of Income Tax may treat the dividends as not sourced in the jurisdiction of listing unless there are facts to show otherwise. In such a circumstance, the ‘headline tax rate condition’ will be considered not met if the jurisdiction in which the dividend paying company is incorporated has a headline tax rate of less than 15%.\n\n### Expenses Incurred in Respect of Foreign-Sourced Income\n\nAll expenses incurred in respect of foreign-sourced income received in Singapore that qualifies for tax exemption must be deducted against such foreign-sourced income. These expenses are not available for deduction against any other taxable income.\n\n### How to Claim Tax Exemption\n\nTo enjoy the tax exemption, you have to provide the following information in your Corporate Income Tax Return (Form C):\n\n*   Nature and amount of income received\n*   Jurisdiction from which the income is received\n*   Headline tax rate of the foreign jurisdiction\n*   Confirmation that foreign tax has been paid in the jurisdiction from which the income is received. This is to satisfy the ‘subject to tax’ condition\n\nIf you are filing Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite) instead of Form C, you should include the above information in the company's tax computation and [retain any supporting documents/ information for at least 5 years](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements) from the relevant YA.\n\n[### Foreign Tax Credit](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income#foreign-tax-credit)\n\nCompanies may claim foreign tax credit for tax paid in a foreign jurisdiction against the Singapore tax payable on the same income.\n\nLearn more about [foreign tax credit](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-reliefs/foreign-tax-credit). \n\nRelated Content\n---------------\n\n[Pages ### Foreign Tax Credit](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-reliefs/foreign-tax-credit)[Pages ### Applying for a Certificate of Residence/ Tax Reclaim Form](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/applying-for-a-certificate-of-residence-tax-reclaim-form)[Pages ### Tax Residency of a Company/ Certificate of Residence](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/tax-residency-of-a-company-certificate-of-residence)[Documents ### Tax Exemption for Foreign-Sourced Income (PDF, 286KB)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/tax-exemption-for-foreign-sourced-income285e5d43d6af4001b3ce35da1e9005b5.pdf?sfvrsn=b5092fba_16)\n\nInland Revenue Authority of Singapore\n-------------------------------------\n\n*   [Careers](https://www.iras.gov.sg/careers)\n*   [News & Events](https://www.iras.gov.sg/news-events)\n*   [Useful links](https://www.iras.gov.sg/useful-links)\n\n[SUBSCRIBE TO OUR eALERTS](https://www.iras.gov.sg/subscribe-to-iras-ealerts)\n\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.iras.gov.sg/contact-us)\n*   [Feedback](https://www.iras.gov.sg/feedback)\n\n*   [IRAS Facebook![Image 140](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/icons-png/facebook4a61cfb7-4fe2-4283-91a6-6742f7d304a0.png?sfvrsn=d2b12b17_1)](https://www.facebook.com/irassg)\n*   [IRAS Instagram![Image 141](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/icons-png/instagram.png?sfvrsn=f1ceb65b_1)](https://www.instagram.com/irassg/)\n*   [IRAS TikTok![Image 142](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/asr/tiktok.png?sfvrsn=a94f28bf_1)](https://www.tiktok.com/@irassg)\n*   [IRAS Twitter![Image 143](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/asr/icons8-twitterx-25-(5).png?sfvrsn=f8edd28a_1)](https://twitter.com/IRAS_SG)\n*   [IRAS LinkedIn![Image 144](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/icons-png/linkedin.png?sfvrsn=3a5ebaa8_1)](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/iras)\n*   [IRAS Youtube![Image 145](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/icons-png/facebook.png?sfvrsn=cb691f57_3)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVWvCzqueXUdrT7VdnrnpaQ)\n*   [Add Telegram Icon to IRAS Website![Image 146](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/assets/telegram-icon.png?sfvrsn=7ed4fd83_6)](https://t.me/irassg)\n*   [IRAS Whatsapp![Image 147](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/asr/whatsapp.png?sfvrsn=15eeb3ea_1)](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VZzNwbsEAKW8218Tl60R)\n\n*   [Report Vulnerability](https://www.tech.gov.sg/report_vulnerability)\n*   [Privacy Statement](https://www.iras.gov.sg/privacy-statement)\n*   [Terms of Use & Browser Compatibility](https://www.iras.gov.sg/terms-of-use-browser-compatibility)\n*   [Sitemap](https://www.iras.gov.sg/sitemap)\n\n© 2025, Government of Singapore\n\nLast updated on 13 June 2025\n\nChat with IRAS\n\n![Image 148: Bot Avatar](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/asr/irasbot-avatar.png)\n\n![Image 149: Bot Avatar](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/asr/irasbot-avatar.png)\n\nIRAS Bot\n\nRate chat\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nPowered by GovTech\n",

The trade -related and modern services clusters, \n\nwhich posted strong outturns in Q4 2021, contracted sequentially in Q1 \n\n2022. In comparison, the domestic -oriented cluster saw a broad -based \n\nexpansion. Within the travel -related cluster, performan ce was uneven, with \n\ngains in the air transport and arts, entertainment & recreation (AER) \n\nsectors partially offset by a sharp pullback in the accommodation sector. \n\n• Supply shocks arising from the Russia -Ukraine conflict have introduced \n\nrenewed uncertaintie s surrounding the outlook for the rest of the year , at \n\na time when global supply chain frictions arising from the pandemic have \n\nyet to be fully resolved. Supply -driven price shocks are eroding real \n\nincomes and could lead to an aggregate demand shock. A static analysis \n\nof global trade and input -output linkages suggests that Singapore’s direct \n\nand indirect exposures to Russia through the income and production \n\nchannels are relatively small. However, the impact could be amplified by \n\nconfidence effects arisin g from higher inflation, tighter financial \n\nconditions , and heightened uncertainty, which would restrain domestic \n\nconsumption and investment. \n\n• Meanwhile, Singapore took a major step towards living with COVID -19 by \n\neasing domestic safe management measures an d border restrictions \n\nsubstantially at the end of March. Reduced restrictions will bring forward \n\nthe projected recovery in the domestic -oriented and travel -related sectors \n\nto Q2, earlier than the previous expectation of the second half of this year. \n\nHoweve r, external -oriented sectors such as manufacturing, wholesale \n\ntrade, water transport and financial services could face some headwinds \n\namid the less optimistic global economic outlook. Barring further \n\nescalation in the Russia -Ukraine conflict or a severe se tback to the \n\nimproving trajectory of the pandemic , the Singapore economy remains on \n\ntrack to grow by 3 –5% in 2022, its second year of above -trend growth. \n\n• From a longer -term perspective, the restructuring of the Singapore \n\neconomy has yielded greater pro ducti vi ty gains in the tradable sector over \n\nthe past decade , with higher returns accruing to capital owners and \n\nspecific segment s of skilled labour . Consequently, the gap between wages \n\nin the tradable and non -tradable sectors ha s persisted over time . The next \n\nphase in Singapore’s restructuring journey is likely to see this divergence \n\nnarrow, as market forces and government polic ies , that incentivise \n\ninvestments in productivity -enhancing technologies and processes , for \n\nexample, facilitate the adjustmen ts . Lower - and middle -income \n\nhouseholds are likely to benefit most from this transition .The Singapore Economy 21 \n\n# 2.1 Recent Economic Developments \n\nGDP growth slowed in Q1 as the trade -related and modern services clusters \n\ncontracted sequentially \n\nThe Singapore economy picked up further at the end of 2021, growing by 2.3% q -o-q SA \n\nin Q4 2021, after some weakness in the preceding two quarters (Chart 2.1) . GDP growth in Q4 \n\nwas largely underpinned by strong outturn s in the trade -related and modern services clusters \n\n(Chart 2 .2) . The se clusters were less affected by the pandemic, with activity already \n\nsurpassing pre -COVID levels by end -2020 . However , the domestic -oriented and travel -related \n\nclusters remained below pre -pandemic levels even at the end of last year. \n\nNot unexpectedly, the high growth momentum could not be sustained and  the trade -\n\nrelated and modern services clusters  contracted sequentially  in the first quarter of 2022 ,\n\nresulting in a slowdown in overall GDP growth  to  0. 4% q-o-q SA (based on the \n\nAdvance \n\nEstimates ). In comparison, the domestic -oriented cluster saw a broad -based expansion. The \n\nperformance was uneven in the travel -related cluster, with gains in the air transport and AER \n\nsectors partially offset by a sharp pullback in the accommodation secto r.

Both clusters subsequently saw a \n\npullback in Q1 from the high base in Q4 2021. Meanwhile, electronics output surged in Q1 ,\n\nsupported by strong global demand for semiconductors used in data centres and 5G \n\nproducts , following a mild contraction in Q4 2021. Elsewhere in the trade -related cluster, \n\ngrowth in wholesale trade slowe d in Q1 2022 , reflecting weaker outturns in the machinery, \n\nequipment & supplies subsegment .\n\nChart 2.3 Industrial production contracted in Q1, weighed down by the biomedical and transport \n\nengineering clusters   \n\n> Index of industrial production (IIP)\n> Source: EDB\n\nModern services lost some momentum after posting strong outturns in \n\nprevious quarters \n\nThe modern services cluster expand ed by 2.5% q -o-q SA in Q4 2021, before declining by \n\n2.0% in Q1 this year (Chart 2.4) . Growth in the cluster in Q4 was driven by the finance & \n\ninsurance sector, which was in turn underpinned by the cyclical recovery in other auxiliary \n\nactivities (mainly payme nts processing), fund management and bank ing , as the pandemic \n\nreceded . Similarly, the firm expansion in the information & communications sector was \n\nsupported by strong mobile phone sales amid new product launches , as well as ongoing \n\ncorporate investments i n digitalisation. 60      \n\n> 80\n> 100\n> 120\n> 140\n> 160\n> 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022Q1\n> Index (2019=100), SA\n> Electronics\n> Chemicals\n> Biomedical\n> Precision\n> Eng\n> Transport Eng\n> General Mfg\n> Overall The Singapore Economy 23\n\nChart 2.4 Modern services contracted sequentially in Q1 2022  \n\n> VA growth of the modern services cluster\n> Source: DOS\n> * Advance Estimates\n\nHowever, the growth momentum in modern services dissipated in Q1 this year , led by a\n\ndecline in the information & communications sector. This was driven by l ower outturns in \n\ngames publishing activities, following several quarters of strong performance , which more \n\nthan offset the expansion in the telecommunications and IT & information serv ices segments. \n\nLikewise, growth in the financ e & insurance sector moderated from its Q4 outturn and \n\nwas only marginal ly positive in Q1 2022, dragged down by the fund management and \n\ninsurance segments. The fund management segment fell sharply, as ongoing geopolitical \n\ntensions and the prospect of policy tightening across major economies weighed on global \n\nequities. Meanwhile , the insu rance segment contracted amid a decline in net premiums from \n\ngeneral insurance, although this was partially offset by improved sales of single -premium life \n\ninsurance products. In comparison, activit y in the banks and other auxiliary segments \n\ncontinued to s upport growth. The banks segment was buttressed by higher loans and \n\nadvances to residents in Jan –Feb , while the other auxiliary segment continued to benefit from \n\na pickup in consumer spending. \n\nThe domestic -facing sectors benefited from the gradual easing o f social \n\nrestrictions \n\nDomestic -oriented activities remained generally lacklustre in Q4 2021, weighed down by \n\nrenewed tightening of COVID -19 safe management measures . Under the “Stabilisation \n\nPhase ” which lasted for about two months from late September , som e restrictions were re -\n\nimposed to moderate the transmission rate of the virus and ease the strain on Singapore’s \n\nhealthcare system. These included the reduction in social gathering and dining -in group sizes \n\nfrom five to two persons and the return to a default work -from -home arrangement. \n\nThere was some improvement in the consumer -facing sectors from late November as \n\nsocial restrictions were ease d (Chart 2. 5) .

Sales of both restaurants and food catering services rose \n\nstrongly by 24.0% q-o-q SA and 13.1% respectively in Q4, and by a further 5.9% and 3.4% in \n\nJan –Feb. The land transport sector also expanded in Q1 following the contraction in the \n\nprevious quarter . Public transport ridership picked up, as up to 50% of employees work ing \n\nfrom home were allowed to return to office at the beginning of 2022. In contrast, retail sales \n\ncontracted by 2.4% q -o-q SA in Jan –Feb, following the 4.8% increase in Q4 . W eaker sales were \n\nrecorded at supermarkets as well as provision and sundry shops, with more households \n\ndin ing out at restaurants. Sales of computer & telecommunication s equipment also \n\ncontracted during this period. In general , t he retail sector has outperformed the other \n\nconsumer -facing industries over the last two years , in part reflecting the shift in demand \n\ntowards essential and durable goods and away from high -touch services during the \n\npandemic .\n\nChart 2.5 The F&B sector saw improved outturns in Q1 as social distancing measures were gradually \n\nrelaxed    \n\n> Retail and F&B sales volumes\n> Source: DOS\n\nIn the construction sector , supply -side disruptions continued to affect activity in Q4 last \n\nyear . The sector contracted by 2.1% q -o-q SA, as new border -entry restrictions 1 on migrant \n\nworkers were put in place in early December because of the Omicron variant. As these \n\nrestrictions we re eased from late Feb ruary , alongside some improvement in the supply of \n\nconstruction materials, t he sector returned to growth of 2. 8% q -o-q SA in Q1 2022. While \n\npublic certified progress payments in the construction sector saw broad -based \n\nimprovements in Jan –Feb, private certified progress payments dipped over the same period, \n\nweighed down by the commercial and industrial segments (Chart 2. 6) .                   \n\n> 1Employers were not allowed to make new applications for Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process (CMP) S Pass and\n> Work Permit holders, as well as other dormitory -bound work pass holders, to enter Singapore via Vaccinated Travel Lanes\n> (VTLs ).Such workers could only enter Singapore via ongoing industry initiatives or the Work Pass Holder General Lane .Retail Sales\n> Food & Beverage\n> Circuit\n> Breaker\n> Heightened\n> Alert\n> 40\n> 50\n> 60\n> 70\n> 80\n> 90\n> 100\n> 110\n> Q4\n> 2019\n> 2020 Q2 Q3 Q4 2021 Q2 Q3 Q4 2022\n> Index (Q4 2019=100), SA\n> Jan –Feb\n\nThe Singapore Economy 25 \n\nChart 2.6 Some recovery was seen in certified progress payments in certain subs egments in Q1, \n\nfollowing the easing of border restrictions on construction workers      \n\n> Nominal c ertified progress payments in the construction sector\n> Source: BCA and Haver Analytics\n> * Estimated based on Jan –Feb 2022 data\n> Note: Certified progress payments refer to the value of all construction works done and certified for progress payments of\n> ongoing projects.

Travel activity picked up further in Q1 with the launch of additional VTL s. MICE \n\nevents 2 ha ve also resumed on a larger scale since mid -August last year , with up to 1,000 \n\nvacci nated attendees permitted for each gathering. Average monthly air passengers carried \n\ndoubled in Q1 2022 compared to Q4 last year , to 774 ,692 (Chart 2.7 ). Average monthly visitor \n\narrivals also grew by 55.8 % in Q1 this year to 82,040 , after having tripled in Q4 from the \n\nprevious quarter . Nonetheless, visitor arrivals were still only about 5% of their pre -pandemic \n\nlevels in 2019 .\n\nThe accommodation sector contracted in Q1 2022, extending the weakness from Q4. \n\nThe decline was largely due to a sharp fall in government bookings. With the majority of \n\nCOVID -19 patients being placed on the Home Recovery programme since October last year, \n\nthere has been a steady decline in demand for hotel quarantines. The hotel occupancy rate \n\nfell to 61% in Q1 this year, from the monthly average of 71 % in Q4 2021, reflecting an increase \n\nin the supply of available rooms as the release of government bookings was not fully \n\nabsorbed by a rise in demand from visitor arrivals and staycation s (Chart 2. 8) .

The shock is , in the first instance, supply -driven, initial ly \n\nmanifest ing as higher inflation at a time when global supply chain frictions arising f rom the \n\npandemic have yet to be fully resolved. Supply -driven price shocks will dent real incomes and \n\ncould lead to a pullback in aggregate demand. These factors will continue to play out in the \n\ncoming quarters, adding to significant uncertainty surroundin g the ripple effect s from the \n\nRussia -Ukraine conflict on Singapore’s economic growth. According to the Singapore \n\nCommercial Credit Bureau (SCCB), the Business Optimism Index dipped slightly in Q2 2022 \n\nto +5.35 % points, from +5.91 % points in the previous quarter, primarily due to the geopolitical \n\nuncertaint y from the war in Ukraine exacerbating risks of global supply chain disruptions in \n\nthe short to medium term. \n\nAn analysis of the income and production channels show s that the spil lover effects of \n\nthe conflict on Singapore ’s economy appear to be relatively contained, most ly limited to \n\nRussia’s role as a major global supplier of crude oil and natural gas. However, the impact \n\ncould be amplified by confidence effects amid heightened vo latility in global financial and \n\ncommodity markets. Moreover, higher input costs could curtail production, while higher \n\ninflation and weaker confidence could also restrain domestic consumption and investment. \n\nThe less optimistic global economic outlook will pose some headwinds to external -oriented \n\nsectors such as manufacturing, wholesale trade, water transport and financial services .\n\nThe additional drag on growth prospects from the conflict would be partially offset by a \n\nboost from the easing of domestic safe management measures and border restrictions from \n\nend -March. Th e loosening of restrictions bring s forward the projected recovery in the \n\ndomestic -oriented and travel -related sectors to Q2 , compare d to previous expectations of a \n\nH2 recovery .0                   \n\n> 20\n> 40\n> 60\n> 80\n> 100\n> 120\n> Dec Mar Jun Sep Dec Mar Jun Sep Dec Mar\n> Index (Dec 2019=100), SA\n> Air Cargo Handled\n> Aircraft Landings\n> Air Passengers\n> Carried\n> 2019 2020 2021 2022 2020 May Sep 2021 May Sep 2022\n> 0\n> 50\n> 100\n> 150\n> 200\n> 250\n> 0\n> 20\n> 40\n> 60\n> 80\n> 100\n> S$\n> Per Cent\n> Standard Average Occupancy Rate\n> Standard Average Room Rate (RHS)\n> Mar The Singapore Economy 27\n\nEconomic linkages between Russia and Singapore are relatively limited, \n\nalthough downside risks could be amplified via confidence effects \n\nRussia’s role in the global economy is more as a major energy supplier , accounting for \n\nmore than 10% of global crude oil and natural gas production , rather than a source of final \n\ndemand. Singapore ’s direct trade exposure to Russia is minimal .3 In 2021, imports from \n\nRussia accounted for just 0.8% of Singapore’s total goods impo rts, while exports to Russia \n\ncomprised 0.1% of total exports. Even for petroleum and related products, Russia contributed \n\nonly 2.8% of Singapore’s imports, with Malaysia, UAE, China, Qatar and Saudi Arabia being the \n\nmain source s. Aside from the effect on global commodity prices , there are two main channels \n\nof indirect exposures through which disruptions to Russia’s exports could have knock -on \n\neffects on Singapore: spillovers from external demand ( the income channel), as well as \n\nsu pply chain linkages ( the production channel). These indirect channels were quantified using \n\nthe latest available data from the 2018 OECD TiVA database. \n\nFigure 2.1 traces the indirect income channel , where Singapore’s key export partners \n\nwith significant ex posures to Russia suffer income losses , in turn reducing demand for our \n\nexports . The top five countries and region s with significant final demand VA originating from \n\nRussia in US$ terms were the Eurozone, China, US, Japan and UK (column 1 in Table 2.1) . As \n\na share of each of these economies ’ total final demand, Russia’s embodied VA is relatively \n\nsmall at less than 1% (column 2) . Singapore is more vulnerable to a fall in final demand in \n\nChina, followed by the US and Eurozone, based on its VA contribution (in US$ terms) to the \n\nfinal demand of these economies (column 3) . After scaling by these third countries/regions’ \n\nexposure to R ussia, Singapore’s VA in the final demand of these markets is just 0.55% of \n\nSingapore’s nominal GDP in aggregate (column 5) . Such static quantification of interlinkages ,\n\nhowever , do es not account for the confidence effects from a larger pullback in overall final \n\ndemand , especially if the conflict escalates or becomes prolonged .\n\nFigure 2. 1 From the income channel, S ingapore ’s exposure to Russia is small …        \n\n> Schematic diagram of Singapore’s exposure to Russia through final demand in third countries /regions\n> Source: EPG, MAS\n> 3Economic linkages with Ukraine are even smaller.\n\nRest of the \n\nGlobal Economy \n\nSingapore \n\nFinal Demand \n\nProduction \n\nFinal Demand \n\nRussia \n\nFinal Demand \n\nProduction Production  \n\n> Income Spending Income Spending\n> Exports\n> Exports\n\n28 Macroeconomic Review | April 2022 \n\nTable 2.1 … at only 0.55% of Singapore’s GDP  \n\n> Impact on Singapore’ sVA through final demand in third countries /region s\n\nRussia’s VA in Final Demand of \n\nCountry/Region \n\nSingapore’s VA in Final Demand of \n\nCountry/Region \n\nCountry/Region  (1) \n\nUS$ \n\nMillion \n\n(2) \n\nShare of \n\nCountry/Region’s \n\nFinal Demand \n\n(%) \n\n(3) \n\nUS$ \n\nMillion \n\n(4) \n\nScaled by \n\nCountry/Region’s \n\nExposure to \n\nRussia, US$ \n\nMillion \n\n[(2) x (3)] \n\n(5) \n\nShare of \n\nSingapore’s \n\nGDP (%) \n\nEurozone  113,477  0.9  25,241  229  0.06 \n\nChina  67,459  0.5  35,713  180  0.05 \n\nUS  38,359  0.2  30,641  56  0.02 \n\nJapan  17,628  0.4  14,439  53  0.01 \n\nUK  15,500  0.6  6,451  36  0.01 \n\nTotal  464,094  0.6  365,726  2,082  0.55  \n\n> Source: 2018 OECD TiVA\n\nThe oil -dependent industries are more affected by the production channel \n\ngiven Russia’s role as a major oil and natural gas producer \n\nFrom the production perspective, Singapore is indirectly impacted through supply chain \n\nlinkages when import ed goods and se rvices from its trading partners contain Russian \n\ncomponents or inputs.

Table 2.5 lists the industries that require the largest amount s of energy -\n\nrelated inputs (in S$ terms) based on Singapore’s 2019 input -output tables . Energy -related \n\ninputs account for a particularly high share of total input requirements in the petrochemical \n\n(40.3%), air transport (31.5%) and water transport (14.4 %) industries . Compared to the major \n\nglobal energy crisis in 1973 , Singapore’s dependence on energy has risen from 1.3% of overall \n\ninputs to 3. 8% in 201 9. The increase is due , in part , to greater downstream demand for refined \n\npetroleum products used as feedstock in the domestic petrochemical industry, which has \n\nexpanded with the development of petrochemical complexes on Jurong Island over the \n\ndecades . Meanwhile, oil dependence in the transport industries has also increased \n\nsubstantially . Higher energy prices will raise production costs in these industries significantly, \n\nwith firms potentially cutting supply and passing on the cost increases to other intermediate \n\nstages of production .The Singapore Economy 31 \n\nTable 2.5 Energy -related inputs account for a larger share of total inputs in the petrochemical, air \n\ntransport and water transport industries \n\n> Top energy -dependent industries\n\nIndustry  Petroleum, Electricity & Gas Inputs \n\n(S$ Million) \n\nShare of \n\nTotal Inputs (%) \n\nWater transport  15,680  14.4 \n\nPetrochemicals  12,942  40.3 \n\nAir transport  5,665  31.5 \n\nWholesale trade  2,771  1. 4\n\nSemiconductor  1, 318  1.3 \n\nLand transport  1,312  12.9 \n\nReal estate  741  2.3 \n\nF&B services  722  4. 7\n\nAll industries (excluding energy sectors)  48,788  3.8   \n\n> Source: DOS 201 9Singapore Input -Output Tables\n\nSemiconductor companies should see limited near -term disruptions from the \n\nconflict as they have diversified their sourcing of raw materials \n\nCompared to the petrochemical and transport industries, the semiconductor industry’s \n\nreliance on oil or energy is smaller (Table 2.5) . Instead, the exposure of the industry to Russia \n\nand Ukraine comes from their role as major suppliers of two crucial inputs : Russia produces \n\n37% of the global supply of palladium 4 and Ukraine supplies 70% of neon .5 Major global chip \n\ncompanies such as Micron, UMC and GlobalFoundries , which have production presence s in \n\nSingapore , have thus far indicated limited disruptions as they have stockpiled raw materials \n\nand diversified sourcing since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Singapore imports \n\npalladium main ly from the UK and the US , rather than Russia , although some of Singapore’s \n\npalladium suppliers may themselves be importing from Russia. In general, the constricted \n\nglobal supply of resources impl ies that future purchases would possibly need to be secured \n\nat higher unit prices. \n\nThe global semiconductor industry upturn could last longer than past cycles, \n\nbut a normalisation of demand amid capacity expansion could presage an \n\neventual consolidation \n\nThe domestic semiconductor industry has been riding the upturn in the global IT sector \n\nsince 2019. Looking at past tech cycles, four phases can be identified from the interplay \n\nbetween global chip sales and inventor y.

At a round the \n\nbeginning of 2020, the industry entered the inventory accumulation phase (Chart 2.9 ). There \n\nwas a surge in final demand for electronics amid global lockdowns and the attendant switch \n\nto working from home and domestic leisure activities, which accelerat ed the structural trend \n\nof digitalisation. The onset of th e pandemic might also have induced panic buying and \n\nprecautionary hoarding of chips by electronics manufacturers. The industry subsequently \n\nentered the expansion phase in late 2020, with robust growth in chip sales leading to a \n\ndrawdown on chip inventory. The tight supply situation persisted throughout 2021, as \n\nindicated by global electronics PMI sub -indices on input prices, suppliers’ delivery time s and \n\nbacklog of work (Chart 2.10) . Towards the end of last year, the escalation in geopolitical \n\ntensions and persistent supply chain challenges triggered another round of hoarding. With \n\nthe outbreak of the Russia -Ukraine conflict , the industry is expected to maintain inventory at \n\na higher level for longer in the face of supply chain uncertainties. Together with s till -firm \n\nglobal chips sales , the inventory accumulation phase of the cycle is expected to extend well \n\ninto 2022.

Investment and consumption demand for electronics, which was robu st during \n\nthe height of the pandemic, ha s shown signs of normalisation in recent quarters. Notably, \n\nafter rapid growth in H1 2021, growth in consumption of IT products in the US and China \n\ndecelerated in H2 (Chart 2.11) . More recently, Apple has reportedly cut its planned output of \n\niPhone and AirPod s devices , citing the Russia -Ukraine c onflict and high inflation as factors \n\nweigh ing on demand for consumer electronics. Similarly , growth in investment demand for \n\ntechnology equipment in the US has eased since the latter half of 2021 (Chart 2.12) .\n\nChart 2.11 Growth in consumption of IT products \n\nhas moderated since H2 last year…      \n\n> Consumption of IT products in US and China\n\nChart 2. 12 … alongside slower growth in \n\ninvestment demand for technology equipment     \n\n> US investment in technology equipment\n> Source: Haver Analytics Source : Haver Analytics\n> Note: The US fixed investment for information processing\n> equipment is used as a proxy for investment in technology\n> equipment.\n\nMeanwhile , supply expansion has continued apace, with global semiconductor capital \n\nspending increas ing strongly by 34% to US$152 billion in 2021 (Chart 2.13) . Chip shortages \n\nand heightened geopolitical tensions have prompted governments to reassess their \n\ncountries’ position s across the semiconductor value chain , roll out new industrial policies ,\n\nand undertake significant investments in semiconductor manufacturing and R&D . In the US, \n\nthe CHIP S for America Act will boost chip manufacturing capacity by establishing a US$5 2\n\nbillion fund to subsidise domestic manufacturing and research. Meanwhile, China’s 14 th Five \n\nYear Plan (2021 –2025) aims to step up support for semiconductor production , includi ng by \n\nreducing or exempting the industry from tax ation, and by helping to build supply chains and \n\nto cultivate talent. \n\nThe global semiconductor value chain is mainly located in advanced economies such as \n\nthe US, South Korea, Japan and Europe. However , a few economies hold significant market \n\nshare in specific segments. For example, South Korea accounted for the principal share of \n\nglobal value added for memory chips at 59% in 2019 , while China and Taiwan comprised 38% \n\nand 27% , respectively, of t he value added for assembly, packaging, and testing (Chart 2. 14 ).\n\nGoing forward, there is a risk of further concentration in the semiconductor value chains \n\nwithin a handful of leading economies undertaking significant investment projects. Minor \n\ndisruptions in the supply of chips from these locations could be amplified into significant \n\nsupply bottlenecks and shortages globally. -60         \n\n> -30\n> 0\n> 30\n> 60\n> 90\n> 120\n> 2009 2012 2015 2018 2021\n> YOY % Growth\n> Q4\n> US\n> China -20\n> -10\n> 0\n> 10\n> 20\n> 30\n> 2009 2012 2015 2018 2021\n> YOY % Growth\n> Q4\n\nThe Singapore Economy 35 \n\nIn addition, t here is potential for some overcapacity in 2023 as large -scale expansions \n\nbegin to come onstream towards the end of th is year. This is particularly the case for \n\nsemiconductors in the relatively mature technology space , including certain dynamic random \n\naccess memory (DRAM) chips that are used in personal computers and servers where the \n\nbulk of the capacity increase is occu rring , rather than cutting -edge chips suitable for building \n\ncentral processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI) \n\naccelerators and networking processors , which are currently only produced by leading firms \n\nsuch as Samsung, TSMC and Intel .6 The risk of oversupply (especially in the memory \n\nsegment ) could weigh on chip prices, and thus nominal global chip sales . With the projected \n\nmoderation in demand amid strong capacity expansions, the industry will likely enter a \n\nconsolidation phase in 2023 .\n\nChart 2. 13 With slowing final demand but strong capex, the semiconductor industry could face some \n\noversupply in 2023            \n\n> Global semiconductor equipment spending\n> Source: Statista\n> 6Chips in the in the relatively mature technology space are in the 22 to 90 nanometer range, while cutting -edge chips require\n> 10 -nanometer or finer nodes. 20\n> 40\n> 60\n> 80\n> 100\n> 120\n> 140\n> 160\n> 2009 2012 2015 2018 2021\n> US$ Billion\n\n36 Macroeconomic Review | April 2022 \n\nChart 2. 14 Some segments of the global semiconductor value chain are highly concentrated in a few \n\neconomies    \n\n> Global semiconductor value added by activity and geography , 2019\n> Source: Semiconductor Industry Association, “2021 State of the US Semiconductor Industry”\n\nSingapore’s trade -related sectors are likely to grow at a more moderate pace \n\nthis year \n\nAgainst this backdrop, the domestic electronics industry could see slower growth in \n\n2022 . Nonetheless, medium -term prospects for the industry remain bright.  Singapore \n\ncontinues to attract investments by leading semiconductor firms. For instance, \n\nGlobalFoundries and UMC are building new wafer fabs for specialty integrated circuits used \n\nin growth areas such as internet of things ( IoT ), communication and automotive applications ,\n\nwith production expected to commence in 2023 –24 .7,8 At the same time, companies are \n\npushing innovation boundaries, with the world's firs t \"Lab -in -Fab\" (an R&D line within a \n\nmanufacturing facility) by STMicroelectronics in partnership with A*STAR and ULVAC \n\nexpected to start volume production in Singapore by end -2022 .9\n\nWhile overall g rowth in the precision engineering cluster is projected to moderate this \n\nyear from the double -digit expansion in 2021 , the mac hinery & systems industry will remain \n\nsupported by resilient demand for semiconductor equipment amid sustained capital \n\ninvestments by glob al semiconductor companies.

Slower growth could be offset in part by the \n\npetroleum refining industry , where prices of refined petroleum products such as gasoline and \n\njet fuel might be supported by the continued recovery in fuel demand as more countries relax \n\nCOVID -19 restrictions. Refining margins would be boosted if the rise in product prices \n\noutstrips crude feedstock costs. \n\nAs for the other trade -related sectors, wholesale trade and water transport are also \n\nexpected to see slower growth in 2022 , on a ccount of lower global trade growth and ongoing \n\nsupply disruptions arising from the Russia -Ukraine conflict. Europe’s ports are suffering from \n\ncongestion caused by custom s checks to comply with sanctions . Analysts also warn of a\n\nlabour squeeze in the global shipping industry where Ukraine and Russia account for 14% of \n\ncommercial seafarers. Renewed COVID -19 lockdowns in major port cities in China such as \n\nShanghai and Shenzhen have hamper ed logistics . Modern supply chains are compl ex and \n\ndifficult to dis entangle, and the war in Ukraine , with its associated sanctions, and ongoing \n\nCOVID -19 restrictions are likely to continue hindering trade flows. These disruptions could \n\ncontribute to shortages of key inputs and introduce frictions th at would slow the delivery of \n\ngoods to final consumers .\n\nGrowth in the financial sector could soften amid market uncertainties \n\nThe prognosis for the financial sector has weakened alongside the softer outlook for the \n\nglobal economy and a fall in business and financial market sentiment . The most significant \n\nnegative impact is likely to be felt in the fund management segment , which could experience \n\na material slowdown in growth compared to previous years ’ strong expansions. G lobal \n\nequities could underperform in the months ahead, reflecting the prospect of tighter -than -\n\nexpected monetary policy settings in advanced economies. While the segment’s longer -term \n\nstructural trend of rising wealth inflows from the region remains intact , the short -term outlook \n\ncould weaken amid the slowdown in regional economies, such as China. \n\nIn addition, the cyclical moderation in growth of the domestic and regional economies is \n\nlikely to c urb demand for credit and insurance. Acc ordingly, both the banks and general \n\ninsurance segments are likely to expand at a more modest pace than predicted earlier .\n\nSimilarly, growth in the payments processing industry could soften on the back of weaker \n\nconsumer sentiment, even if it remains suppo rted by the structural shift to e -payments .\n\nIn the quarters ahead , the downside risks to the financial sector remain elevated. First, \n\nslower growth and heightened inflation in the global economy owing to a prolonged Russia -\n\nUkraine conflict or a resurgence in COVID -19 c ould inhibit demand for credit and insurance .\n\nSecond, a f aster -than -expected pace of policy tightening in advanced economies could dent \n\nmarket sentiment and lead to a repricing of financial assets. Finally , a more significant \n\nslowdown in the Chinese economy could have a broad -based impact on the financial sector ,\n\nincluding through lower trade credit demand. 38 Macroeconomic Review | April 2022 \n\nThe s ubstantial easing of mobility restrictions from Q2 w ill hasten recovery in \n\nthe consumer -facin g and travel -related clusters \n\nWith the cresting of the Omicron wave , mobility restrictions were eased significantly \n\nfrom end -March. Social gathering group size s were doubled to 10 people , while the share of \n\nemployees working onsite and the capacity limit f or larger events was increased to 75%, from \n\nthe earlier 50%. These restrictions were fully lifted from end -April. Nightlife businesses we re \n\nalso allowed to re open from mid -April, after more than two years of closure . In addition, a new \n\nand simplified travel scheme, the Vaccinated Travel Framework, replaced the Vaccinated \n\nTravel Lane s scheme , with most restrictions lifted for fully vaccinated travellers to Singapore. \n\nThese measures should bring forward the projected recovery in the domestic -oriented and \n\ntravel -related sectors to Q2 , instead of the latter part of 2022 , as projected previously .\n\nNevertheless , the travel -related clusters are not expected to fully recoup their pandemic \n\nlosses in the near term, as the un certainty from the Russia -Ukraine conflict and spike s in \n\nprices could weigh on consumer sentiment . Further, there is a risk of a structural decline in \n\nbusiness travel . The a ccommodation sector could take time to recover fully as tourists ,\n\nparticularly from countries in the region whose vaccination rates are low er , return only \n\ngradually , even as domestic demand for staycations wane s. To speed up the recovery in the \n\ntourism sector and capture pent -up travel demand , the government has earmarked nearly \n\n$500 million in various initiatives to attract visitors to Singapore . Th ese include curating and \n\ncreating attractions and events with a sustainability and wellness focus, as well as defending \n\nSingapore’s position as a “Global -Asia” node for business tourism. For example, Singapore \n\nrecently hosted the Singapore International Water Week and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore \n\nand , in the coming months, will host other large -scale M ICE events, such as Asia Tech x \n\nSingapore , Food&HotelAsia and Design Fair Asia .\n\nSectoral growth drivers will broaden in 2022, with overall GDP growth \n\nexpected to come in at 3 –5% \n\nAll in, G DP growth is projected at 3 –5% in 2022, in the absence of further disruptions \n\ncaused by the war in Ukraine or a severe worsening of the pandemic . The projected growth \n\noutcome represents a moderati on from the 7.6% expansion in 2021 , but would still be above \n\ntrend for the second consecutive year . The drivers of growth shou ld broaden to the domestic -\n\noriented and travel -related clusters over the course of this year, with the substantial easing of \n\ndomestic safe management measures and border restrictions. Accordingly, sectors which \n\nbore the brunt of the pandemic are projected to stage a more decisive recovery and contribute \n\nmore significantly to GDP growth in 2022 compared to last year . The trade -related cluster, \n\nwhich led the recovery in 2021 , could see its contribution shrink this year , while the \n\ncontribution of modern services is expected to be stable. By the end of 2022, output levels in \n\nsome segment s of the economy are still expected to remain below pre -pandemic levels ,\n\nal though th ey would be significantly above their respective trough s. T hese includ e the travel -\n\nrelated industries of air transport, accommodation and AER, as well as the domestic -oriented \n\nindustries such as land transport, construction and administrati ve & support services .The Singapore Economy 39 \n\n# 2.3 The Next Phase of Economic Restructuring in \n\n# Singapore \n\nSingapore’s restructuring journey in the last decade has led to productivity -\n\ndriven growth \n\nThe E conomic Strategies Committee (ESC) was formed in 2009 to develop strategies for \n\nSingapore to achieve sustained and inclusive growth . One of the key recommendations was \n\na shift from a labour -driven to a productivity -driven growth model . A productivity growth target \n\nwas set at 2–3% per annum , which would in turn support annual economic growth of 3 –5%.\n\nIn the course of this restructuring journey , the economy was expected to experienc e several \n\nphases of adjustment s (Fig ure 2. 3). In the initial cost -adjustment phase (2011 –13), nominal \n\nwages would rise strongly, with CPI inflation stay ing above its historical average, reflecting \n\ntight labour market conditions , even as real GDP beg an to slow. In the consolidation phase \n\n(2014 –16), GDP growth would slow discernibly while wage growth remained elevated. The \n\nsteep rise in business costs could have caused some unproductive firms to consolidate or \n\nwind down their businesses in Singapore. In the recovery phase (2017 –19), there would be a\n\nnotable improvement in productivity (measured in terms of real VA per paid hour worked) ,\n\nand cost pressures were expected to ease. GDP growth was projected to pick up at the end \n\nof the decade. \n\nOverall, the macroeconomic outcomes have been broadly in line with the path that had \n\nbeen envisaged (Table 2.7 ). From 2011 to 2019, GDP growth took a step down from the \n\nprevious decade and became increasingly driven by productivity improvements. However, CPI \n\ninflation was capped in the latter half of the decade , in part due to the weakness in global oil \n\nprices. With inflation ed ging down and n ominal wage growth pick ing up, there was a rise in \n\nreal wage growth. \n\nFigure 2. 3 The 2010s saw three distinct phases of macroeconomic transition                           \n\n> Stylised profile of real GDP and CPI levels\n> Source: EPG, MAS estimates\n> Note: This chart depicts a stylised profile of the path of GDP and CPI over the transition period in comparison to abaseline\n> scenario envisaged in 2011 .2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n> CPI\n> GDP\n> Consolidation\n> Phase\n> Recovery\n> •Limited impact\n> on growth\n> •Mounting price\n> pressures\n> •Peak price pressures\n> •Unproductive firms\n> consolidate in the face\n> of higher business costs\n> •GDP growth\n> improves\n> •Price pressures\n> ease\n> Cost -adjustment\n> Phase\n\n40 Macroeconomic Review | April 2022 \n\nTable 2. 7 Productivity improve d following a period of transition  \n\n> Average annual change in key macroeconomic variables\n\n% YOY  2001 –10  Cost -adjustment \n\n(2011 –13) \n\nConsolidation \n\n(2014 –16) \n\nRecovery \n\n(2017 –19)  2011 –19 \n\nReal GDP  5.9  5.2  3.5  3.1  3.9 \n\nNominal wages  3.3  5.2  4.3  4.1  4.5 \n\nCPI -All items inflation  1.6  4.1  0.0  0.5  1.5 \n\nMAS Core Inflation  1.7  2.1  1.1  1.4  1.6 \n\nReal VA per paid hour worked  2.3  1.2  1.7  3.0  2.0 \n\nContribution of productivity to \n\nreal GDP growth  39%  23%  48%  97%  50%    \n\n> Source: DOS, MOM and EPG, MAS estimates\n> Note: Real VA per paid hour worked is computed using real VA per worker and average weekly total paid hours worked per\n> employee .\n\nThe overall transformation has been accompanied by widening divergence \n\nbetween the tradable and non -tradable sectors since the mid -2010s \n\nThe strong growth in overall wages and productivity during the recovery phase masked \n\nsectoral disparities within the Singapore economy .

According to th e Samuelson -Balassa \n\nhypothesis , countries with high productivity in the tradable sector tend to have higher overall \n\nprice level s, compared to countries with lower productivity .

Introduction\n---------------\n\nLand is a vital resource for human survival. Since the implementation of China’s reform and opening-up policy, the country has experienced steady population growth, along with rapid industrialization and urbanization. By 2020, the population had reached 1.41 billion, and the urbanization rate had risen to 63.9%. These changes have underscored the scarcity of land resources and intensified competition among various land uses. China is currently undergoing a profound transformation in land use and ranks among the countries most affected by land-use conflicts (LUCs). Consequently, these conflicts have become a significant focus of research within the academic community in China [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B1-land-14-00249)].\n\nThe concept of “production–living–ecological” spaces (PLEs) was proposed by the Chinese government as part of its ecological civilization initiative to promote sustainable land use. This framework has spurred extensive academic research in China, focusing on its conceptual framework, functional classification, regional applications, and theoretical development. Scholars have examined PLEs from diverse perspectives, including land functions, ecological roles, and landscape dynamics, resulting in the development of a functional classification system to identify the primary spatial roles of different land types [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B2-land-14-00249),[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B3-land-14-00249)]. Quantitative analyses of PLEs have further explored functional intensities, providing a basis for assessments of spatial suitability, carrying capacity, and spatial coordination [[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B4-land-14-00249),[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B5-land-14-00249)]. The spatiotemporal evolution of PLEs, landscape pattern changes, LUCs diagnosis, and the analysis of driving forces are also included, offering valuable insights for future applications and policymaking [[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B6-land-14-00249),[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B7-land-14-00249),[8](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B8-land-14-00249),[9](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B9-land-14-00249)].\n\nLUCs is a global challenge that has attracted significant attention from researchers and the public. Studies have examined various aspects of LUCs, including their causes, classifications, intensity, and strategies for prevention and resolution. Early research primarily attributed LUCs to competition among stakeholders and interest groups [[10](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B10-land-14-00249),[11](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B11-land-14-00249)]. However, more recent studies have identified additional contributing factors, such as natural disasters [[12](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B12-land-14-00249)], land-use externalities [[13](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B13-land-14-00249),[14](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B14-land-14-00249)], and the complexities of multifunctional land use [[15](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B15-land-14-00249)]. Current research on LUCs primarily focuses on tensions between construction land and agricultural land, conflicts among different land-use functions [[16](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B16-land-14-00249)], and the competing demands of economic development, food security, and ecological conservation [[17](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B17-land-14-00249),[18](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B18-land-14-00249)]. Other perspectives, such as the encroachment of urban residential land on farmland and the degradation of forest and grassland due to marginal land cultivation, have also gained scholarly attention [[19](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B19-land-14-00249),[20](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B20-land-14-00249)]. To better analyze LUCs, researchers have developed frameworks incorporating environmental, geographic, socio-economic, and policy factors to quantify conflict intensity [[21](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B21-land-14-00249),[22](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B22-land-14-00249)]. High-resolution remote sensing enables large-scale pattern analysis, while landscape ecology provides systematic evaluation methods [[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B6-land-14-00249),[23](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B23-land-14-00249)]. Metrics such as land scarcity, competitiveness, and suitability differences are key for assessing conflict intensity, offering practical strategies for mitigation and management [[24](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B24-land-14-00249),[25](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B25-land-14-00249)].\n\nDespite progress in LUC research, significant gaps remain. First, most studies focus on macro-level analyses, neglecting the complexity and diversity of land use within regions [[26](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B26-land-14-00249)]. The interplay between urban expansion, ecological conservation, and industrial development demands further exploration. Second, limited spatial resolution and the lack of fine-scale methods hinder the accurate identification of LUCs, leaving regional variations underexamined [[27](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B27-land-14-00249)]. Third, current research often fails to offer actionable strategies for managing specific types of LUCs, limiting its practical value for policy guidance. Addressing these issues requires deeper investigation into regional and urban LUCs to uncover root causes and provide targeted, implementable solutions for decision-makers.\n\nAs China undergoes rapid urbanization and globalization, the transformation of agricultural and ecological land into construction land has intensified, shifting the drivers of LUCs from stakeholder competition to tensions between limited land resources and the demands of economic growth [[28](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B28-land-14-00249)]. The Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), one of China’s most dynamic and innovative regions, exemplifies these challenges with its accelerated land-use changes and mounting ecological pressures.\n\nThis paper contributes to the literature by integrating the intensity and potential of LUCs in the GBA for 2020. The remainder of this study is structured as follows. [Section 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#sec2-land-14-00249) introduces the materials and methods, including the study area, data sources, and the research framework. It also details the construction of the Production–Living–Ecological Function-Evaluation Model, the development of the Identification and Intensity Diagnosis Model of LUC Zones, and the analysis of the spatial relationships of LUCs. [Section 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#sec3-land-14-00249) presents the results, focusing on the spatial distribution characteristics of land-use function intensity, the LUCs zones, and the spatial relationships of land-use conflicts. [Section 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#sec4-land-14-00249) discusses the findings through comparative analysis, insights from the GBA, and policy recommendations tailored to address LUCs. Finally, [Section 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#sec5-land-14-00249) concludes the study with a summary of the main findings and their implications for sustainable land management.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n------------------------\n\n### 2.1. Study Area and Data Source\n\nThe GBA, a prominent coastal urban cluster in southern China, is geographically situated between 22°00′ N and 24°00′ N latitude and 112°00′ E and 115°00′ E longitude. Spanning an area of approximately 56,000 square kilometers, the GBA encompasses nine major cities in Guangdong Province—Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Zhaoqing—along with the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions ([Figure 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f001)). Located at the core of the Pearl River Delta and bordering the South China Sea, the GBA features a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 22 °C and abundant rainfall. Its diverse terrain includes a dense river network, delta plains, hills, coastal bays, and islands, providing favorable natural conditions and rich ecological resources.\n\n**Figure 1.** The location of the GBA.\n\nData types used in this study include remote-sensing land-use data, DEM elevation data, vectorized road data, geographic coordinate points of interest (POI) data, and socio-economic data for the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in 2020 ([Table 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t001)). Remote-sensing land-use data, including land-use types, geomorphic characteristics, distances to urban and rural settlements, water bodies, forest coverage, and greening coverage, were obtained from the Chinese National Land Use and Cover Change Dataset (CNLUCC) [[29](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B29-land-14-00249)]. DEM elevation data were downloaded from the Geospatial Data Cloud [[30](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B30-land-14-00249)] to derive slope and aspect information for the study area. Road vector data indicating distances to major roads were sourced from OpenStreetMap [[31](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B31-land-14-00249)]. Geographic coordinate data, including distances to major ports, educational and medical facilities, and pharmacies, were extracted from the Baidu Map Platform [[32](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B32-land-14-00249)]. Socio-economic data, such as GDP, the output of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, industrial output proportion, government fiscal metrics, consumer price index, urban per capita disposable income, and rainfall, were collected from the China Statistical Yearbook (2021) [[33](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B33-land-14-00249)] and the Guangdong Statistical Yearbook (2021) [[34](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B34-land-14-00249)].\n\n**Table 1.** Data source.\n\nThe data processing was conducted as follows. Firstly, based on the National Land-Use/Cover Classification System for Ecological Remote-Sensing Monitoring [[29](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B29-land-14-00249)], 20 land-use types were identified in the study area, with their respective names and codes: paddy field (11), dry land (12), forest land (21), shrub (22), sparse woodland (23), other forest land (24), high-coverage grassland (31), medium-coverage grassland (32), low-coverage grassland (33), river and canal (41), lake (42), reservoir and pond (43), tidal flat (45), beach land (46), urban land (51), rural residential areas (52), other construction land (53), sandy land (61), swamp land (64), and bare land (65). Secondly, a 500 m × 500 m grid was overlaid with the 2020 land-use data to create 268,493 evaluation units. This approach ensured consistency and accuracy in the assessment of land-use functionality and conflict intensity while also effectively reflecting spatial variations across the study area.\n\n### 2.2. Research Framework\n\nIn the GBA, LUCs arise from imbalances among production, living, and ecological functions. To address these challenges, this study implements a comprehensive framework comprising three key models and analytical stages:\n\n1.\nProduction–Living–Ecological Function-Evaluation Model:\n\nUsing remote-sensing, terrain, vectorized data, geographic coordinates, and socio-economic indicators, the production, living, and ecological functions of land units were evaluated. Functional strengths were classified into three levels—strong, moderate, and weak—using the natural breaks method, establishing the foundation for conflict identification.\n\n2.\nIdentification and Intensity Diagnosis Model of LUCs Zones:\n\nThis model identified 10 distinct types of LUCs by comparing the functional strengths within land units. These conflict types were further categorized into four intensity stages, enabling a diagnostic framework to delineate and classify LUC zones across the GBA.\n\n3.\nSpatial Relationship of LUCs:\n\nSpatial hotspot analysis was conducted to determine the distribution characteristics of LUCs, highlighting regions with high conflict concentrations. Neighborhood analysis was employed to evaluate the spatial relationships and escalation potential of conflict areas, offering insights into interdependencies and regional vulnerabilities.\n\n4.\nPolicy Recommendations for Sustainable Land Management:\n\nBased on the results from the three stages, governance strategies were proposed to mitigate LUCs and promote sustainable land management. These strategies emphasize the balance of production, living, and ecological functions tailored to the specific natural, social, and economic conditions within the GBA.\n\nA cohesive link is established between the PLEs and production, living, and ecological functions in this study. By integrating these interdependent dimensions, the research provides a structured approach to analyzing LUCs, offering a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics within the PLE framework. This approach not only highlights the interactions among production, living, and ecological functions but also lays a robust foundation for proposing targeted governance strategies that address specific LUC challenges. Furthermore, it contributes to advancing sustainable land management practices by aligning analytical methods with the holistic perspective of PLEs.\n\n### 2.3. Construction of Production–Living–Ecological Function-Evaluation Model\n\nThe production–living–ecological function-evaluation model developed in this study represents a novel approach to comprehensively assessing land-use functions. It integrates the production, living, and ecological functions of land into a unified evaluation framework. By incorporating multiple indicators and leveraging advanced methods, such as the entropy weight method for index weighting and comprehensive scoring, this model provides a more holistic and nuanced understanding of land-use functionality. This innovative framework not only bridges gaps in existing research but also offers practical insights for balancing economic development, social well-being, and ecological sustainability in land management.\n\n#### 2.3.1. Selection of Production–Living–Ecological Function-Evaluation Index\n\nLUCs arise from the interaction of various factors. This study developed evaluation models for production, living, and ecological functions by selecting indicators from natural, locational, and social categories. Fundamental natural indicators included land-use type and geomorphic features, with slope, aspect, and NPP index applied to the production function model; slope and aspect to the living function model; and patch edge density to the ecological function model. Locational indicators for all models included distances to urban areas, rural settlements, water bodies, roads, and ports. Additional metrics, such as distances to educational facilities, medical facilities, and pharmacies, were integrated into the living function model. Socio-economic factors for the production function model included GDP, agricultural and forestry output, and the share of industrial output. The living function model incorporated public expenditure, public income, consumer price index, and urban per capita disposable income, while the ecological function model used forest coverage, rainfall, and greening coverage as indicators.\n\nTo account for the diversity of data types, different processing methods were used. For locational and distance-related indicators, the natural breaks method was applied, assigning scores based on proximity to the target. Natural factors were scored according to the functional characteristics of land-use types, drawing on existing research, with slope and aspect evaluated using a standardized framework [[25](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B25-land-14-00249),[35](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B35-land-14-00249),[36](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B36-land-14-00249)]. Socio-economic indicators were scored based on their deviation from the mean value of each metric ([Table 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t002)).\n\n**Table 2.** Evaluation indicators, classification, and weights of production–living–ecological spaces.\n\n#### 2.3.2. Weight Calculation of Production–Living–Ecological Function-Evaluation Index\n\nThis study applied the entropy weight method to calculate the weights of indicators within each evaluation model. The calculation process was as follows:\n\nThe data for each evaluation model were first compiled into a matrix X:\n\nX=(x i j)m×n=x 11⋯x 1 n⋮⋯⋮x m 1⋯x m n\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x i represents the initial value of the index i in the j th functional evaluation model (i = 1, 2, 3).\n\nThe second step normalizes the data, scaling each index to a 0–1 range. The calculation process was as follows:\n\nPositive index:z i=(x i−M i n(x))(M a x(x)−M i n(x))\n\n(2)\n\nNegative index:z i=1−(x i−M i n(x))(M a x(x)−M i n(x))\n\n(3)\n\nwhere x ij is the initial value of index i in jth evaluation models; z i j is the standardized value of x ij; Max(x i) and Min(x i) are the respective maximum and minimum values of index i in each function-evaluation model.\n\nThe third step determines the proportion of each index’s average value to the total sum of all indices. The calculation formula is as follows:\n\np i j=z i j∑j=1 n z i j\n\n(4)\n\nwhere z ij is the standardized value of the ith index in the j th evaluation model.\n\nThe fourth step calculates the entropy of each index within each evaluation system. The calculation formula is as follows:\n\nH i=−k∑i=1 n p i j ln⁡p i j\n\n(5)\n\nwhere n is the total number of observed values, representing the number of units, n = 268,493, k ≥ 0, k = 1/ln(n), Hi ≥ 0. When p ij = 0, p ij lnp ij = 0.\n\nThe fifth step is to calculate the weight of each index and each criterion layer in each index system. The calculation formula is as follows:\n\nIndex weight:w i j=1−H i∑i=1 m(1−H i);(0≤w i j≤1),∑i=1 m w i j=1\n\n(6)\n\nCriterion layer weight:W v j=1−H i∑v=1 v(1−H i);(0≤W v j≤1),∑v=1 v W v j=1\n\n(7)\n\nwhere w ij is the weight of the i th index in the j th evaluation model, 1 − H i is the deviation degree of the i th index, indicating the difference between the indexes of the evaluation unit, m is the number of evaluation indexes, W vj is the weight of the v th criterion layer in the j th evaluation model, and y is the number of indexes in the factor layer.\n\n#### 2.3.3. Comprehensive Scoring of Production–Living–Ecological Function-Evaluation Model\n\nCalculate the comprehensive score of each unit in each evaluation model. The calculation formula is as follows:\n\nF i j=∑(W v j×w i j×f i j)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere F ij represents the score of the i th evaluation unit in the j th evaluation model. The greater the value, the greater the corresponding functional intensity. W vj and w ij are the weights of the criterion layer and the factor layer, respectively, and f ij is the score of the index.\n\n### 2.4. Identification and Intensity Diagnosis Model of LUCs Zones\n\nThe evaluation model for production, living, and ecological land-use functions calculated scores for each unit. Using the natural breaks method, these scores were divided into three categories—strong (S), moderate (M), and weak (W)—corresponding to high, medium, and low functional zones for each dimension. By combining the functional levels across the three categories, 27 unique functional relationships were identified [[37](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B37-land-14-00249)]. These were further grouped into 10 types of LUC zones based on their shared characteristics and distinctions ([Table 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t003)).\n\n**Table 3.** Composition and types of production–living–ecological function conflicts.\n\nBuilding on existing research, this study categorizes LUC intensity into four stages: stable and controllable stage, basic controllable stage, basic out-of-control stage, and basic out-of-control stage [[17](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B17-land-14-00249),[35](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B35-land-14-00249),[37](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B37-land-14-00249)]. This framework allows for a detailed analysis of conflict levels. At the stable and controllable stage, conflicts are minimal or latent, with no significant impact on land use. The basic controllable stage involves emerging conflicts that are largely constructive and can be managed with minimal interventions to reduce potential risks. The basic out-of-control stage marks escalating conflicts and a loss of control over land-use transitions, requiring prompt action to restore balance. In the serious out-of-control stage, conflicts fully escalate, necessitating urgent administrative, legal, and economic measures to prevent further deterioration and potential social instability.\n\n### 2.5. Spatial Relationship of LUCs\n\nHotspot analysis was employed to explore the spatial relationships of LUCs and their potential, identifying “cold spots” and “hot spots” to pinpoint areas of clustering and conflict intensity.\n\nSignificant differences in conflict levels between neighboring units suggest stronger interactions, potentially intensifying conflicts in adjacent areas. A “3 × 3” rectangular grid was used, with the neighborhood analysis function in ArcGIS 10.8 calculating the standard deviation of the central unit to assess the influence of surrounding units. The formula is as follows:\n\nY i=∑i=1 N(x i−x¯)2 N\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Y i represents the standard deviation of the i th unit, which means that the greater the conflict level difference between the surrounding unit and the central unit, the greater the conflict potential of the land-use function of the central unit, and the more likely it is to develop into a unit with higher conflict level. x i represents the conflict level of the central unit, which is replaced by the intensity of eight conflict areas (x i = 1, 2, 3, …, 8). The greater the value, the stronger the conflict intensity, x represents the average value of the conflict level of units in the range, and N is the number of units in the range (n = 2, 3, 4, …, 9).\n\n3. Results\n----------\n\n### 3.1. Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Land-Use Function Intensity\n\n#### 3.1.1. Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Production Function Intensity\n\nIn 2020, production functions in the GBA were categorized into low, medium, and high levels, accounting for 37.16%, 31.19%, and 31.65% of the total area, respectively ([Table 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t004)). Over 60% of the units were classified as medium or high production zones, primarily featuring urban land, paddy fields, and forested areas, reflecting relatively strong production functionality overall. Significant spatial differences were observed in the distribution of production zones, specifically in the varying levels of production functionality across different regions. High-level production zones were concentrated in the central and southeastern regions, particularly in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan ([Figure 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f002)a). These areas are characterized by advanced economies, high urbanization, and abundant resources, which enhance regional production efficiency and facilitate integration into global value chains. Globalization plays a critical role in these regions, fostering export-oriented industries, innovation clusters, and logistics networks that support high-level production functionality. Medium-level production zones, on the other hand, were distributed across the eastern and southern regions, including Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, and Hong Kong. These cities benefit from geographic advantages, policy support, and integration into global production and trade networks. Acting as essential links between high-level zones and peripheral areas, they contribute to resource allocation, logistics management, and workforce distribution. Such dynamics highlight how globalization impacts regional production, shaping both medium- and high-level zones through interconnected trade and economic activities.\n\n**Figure 2.** Spatial distribution of PLEs intensities in the GBA.\n\n**Table 4.** Composition of land use for production–living–ecological functions in the GBA.\n\n#### 3.1.2. Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Living Function Intensity\n\nIn 2020, living functions in the GBA were divided into low, medium, and high levels, accounting for 41.38%, 29.75%, and 28.87% of the total area, respectively ([Table 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t004)). Approximately 60% of the land fell into medium or high living zones, indicating moderately high overall functionality. High-level living zones, dominated by urban land, paddy fields, and forested areas, were concentrated in central and southern regions such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan, Hong Kong, and Macao ([Figure 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f002)b). These areas benefit from advanced infrastructure, high urbanization levels, and favorable living conditions. Hong Kong’s internationalized economy and Macao’s tourism-oriented development contributed significantly to their classification as high-function zones, supported by efficient public services, advanced healthcare systems, and rich cultural resources. Medium-level zones, including Zhuhai, Huizhou, and Zhongshan, provided relatively adequate living services but remained less developed compared to core cities. Low-level zones were concentrated in the northwest and southwest, particularly in Zhaoqing and Jiangmen, where geographic remoteness, limited industrial diversification, and weaker economic activity hindered progress in living standards.\n\n#### 3.1.3. Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Ecological Function Intensity\n\nThe spatial clustering of ecological functions in the GBA was less distinct compared to production and living functions, with limited connectivity between areas of varying ecological function intensity. High-level ecological zones were primarily located in peripheral cities such as Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, and Huizhou, where forested land and water bodies dominate, supported by lower urbanization and more intact natural ecosystems ([Figure 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f002)c). Medium-function zones formed transitional areas between urban cores and peripheral regions, consisting largely of mixed agricultural and forested land. In contrast, low-level ecological zones were concentrated in highly urbanized cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Macao, where urban and industrial land uses significantly reduced ecological functionality. Despite localized conservation efforts, urban expansion and intensive human activity continue to exert pressure on ecological environments. Low, medium, and high ecological function zones accounted for 44.65%, 36.46%, and 18.89% of the total area, respectively ([Table 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t004)), reflecting relatively weak ecological functionality, with nearly half of the area classified as low-function zones. Hong Kong and Macao, heavily urbanized and constrained by limited green space, experienced particularly high ecological strain. The spatial pattern of ecological functionality reflects a center-periphery gradient, where ecological intensity improves with distance from urban cores.\n\n### 3.2. Spatial Distribution Characteristics of LUCs Zones\n\nAccording to [Table 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t003), the spatial distribution in [Figure 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f003)a shows that weak multifunctional conflict zones, dual-function low-intensity conflict zones, and dual-function low-intensity strong conflict zones cover 39.22% of the study area ([Table 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t005)). These zones are mainly located in the western and southern regions, concentrated in Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, and Macao ([Figure 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f003)b). Forested land dominates these areas, accounting for 18.72%, followed by paddy fields at 4.97%. Other land types include dry land, sparse woodland, reservoirs and ponds, high-coverage grassland, and various other uses, including urban and rural residential land, ranked in descending order by area. These zones are in a stable and controllable stage, characterized by low development levels and minimal multifunctional overlap. Predominantly ecological, these areas exhibit limited functional demands, reducing the likelihood and intensity of LUCs.\n\n**Figure 3.** Spatial distribution of LUCs and conflicts stages in the GBA.\n\n**Table 5.** Composition of LUCs levels by Area in the GBA.\n\nDual-function moderate-intensity conflict zones, complex multifunctional conflict zones, and moderate multifunctional conflict zones account for 28.73% of the study area ([Table 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t005)). These zones are primarily located in the eastern and central-eastern regions, concentrated in Dongguan, Huizhou, and Hong Kong ([Figure 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f003)c). Forested land dominates these areas, comprising 9.50%, followed by paddy fields at 5.51%. These zones are in a basic controllable stage, where urbanization and human activity increase the likelihood of LUCs but remain within manageable limits. In Hong Kong, despite challenges from high urbanization and limited land resources, effective land-use planning and strict development controls have kept overall conflict levels lower compared to other core cities in the GBA.\n\nDual-function moderate-intensity strong conflict zones and dual-function high-intensity conflict zones cover 25.41% of the study area ([Table 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t005)), predominantly located in the central, northern, and east-central regions, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan ([Figure 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f003)d). These areas form a spatially concentrated conflict pattern along the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Foshan axis, reflecting their status as core hubs of economic, political, and cultural activity within the GBA. Land-use competition in these zones is driven by high multifunctionality, with forested land comprising 6.45% and paddy fields 4.76%, alongside urban land, other construction land, dryland, reservoirs, sparse woodland, and rural residential areas. Smaller contributions from grassland, shrubland, beaches, and wetlands further diversify the land-use structure. The mixture of urban and ecological functions intensifies conflicts as development pressures intersect with conservation demands. The spatial conflict pattern highlights the dual role of these regions: as economic and administrative cores with dense urbanization, they attract significant development, yet their ecological functions remain vital for regional sustainability. The competition between these functions has created basic out-of-control zones where land-use demands often exceed the capacity for balanced management. Addressing these challenges requires strategies to reconcile urban growth with ecological preservation, especially given the pivotal role these areas play in the broader regional economy.\n\nDual-function high-intensity strong conflict zones and severe multifunctional high-intensity conflict zones occupy 6.64% of the study area, primarily concentrated in the northern peripheral regions of the GBA ([Figure 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f003)e). Forested land accounts for 3.66%, and paddy fields for 1.09% of these zones ([Table 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#table_body_display_land-14-00249-t005)). These areas are mainly located in the northern parts of Guangzhou, characterized by intense production and living functions while also serving as ecologically sensitive zones. The high intensity of competing land-use functions places these regions in a serious out-of-control state. The strong functional demands lead to frequent conflicts as production and living activities increasingly encroach upon ecological priorities, intensifying the struggle for limited land resources. This spatial pattern underscores the challenges of balancing high-intensity land use with ecological conservation in regions where all functions are expressed at their peak. Effective conflict mitigation strategies are critical to manage these zones and prevent further ecological degradation or disruption of essential urban functions.\n\n### 3.3. Spatial Relationship of Land-Use Function Conflicts Area\n\nHot spots of LUC intensity were predominantly located in the central-eastern regions of the study area, including Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen, Dongguan, and northeastern Huizhou ([Figure 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f004)a). These areas are marked by rapid economic growth, advanced urbanization, and extensive transportation networks. The convergence of production, living, and ecological demands in these regions has created highly complex and diversified land-use patterns, intensifying conflicts as these functions compete for limited resources. The concentration of conflicts in these areas reflects their role as economic and urban hubs within the region. Rapid development amplifies pressures on land resources, with urban expansion often encroaching on agricultural and ecological spaces. Moreover, the integration of these areas into global production and trade networks further complicates land-use dynamics as industrial, residential, and environmental priorities intersect. Addressing these challenges requires integrated land management strategies that balance development with ecological and social needs to ensure sustainable growth in these high-conflict zones.\n\n**Figure 4.** Spatial relationship of LUCs and LUCs potential zones in the GBA.\n\nThe neighborhood analysis reveals a moderate risk of LUCs across the study area, with low, general, high, and extreme conflict potential zones accounting for 47.88%, 23.43%, 22.14%, and 6.54% of the total area, respectively. Extreme conflict potential zones are primarily concentrated in Dongguan, Jiangmen, and the central areas of Zhaoqing and Zhongshan ([Figure 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f004)b). These regions require immediate intervention through measures such as restricting urban expansion or protecting ecological green spaces. Effective spatial boundary controls are essential to regulate internal land development and minimize the influence of adjacent units, preventing further escalation of conflicts. High-conflict-potential zones are mainly distributed in Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, Huizhou, Hong Kong, and Macao. These areas face increasing pressure from competing land-use demands, and proactive measures are needed to maintain a balance between production, living, and ecological functions. Strategic planning should prioritize the prevention of intensifying conflicts, ensuring long-term sustainability in these high-risk regions.\n\nA cold and hot spot analysis was conducted to examine the spatial distribution of LUC potential across different units in the GBA. The results indicate that hot spots of conflict potential were concentrated in Dongguan and along the administrative boundaries of “Foshan–Zhaoqing”, “Foshan–Jiangmen”, and “Guangzhou–Zhongshan” ([Figure 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#fig_body_display_land-14-00249-f004)c). These areas are not only high-conflict zones but also regions with elevated conflict potential, highlighting their critical stage of land-use competition. The conflicts between production, living, and ecological functions in these zones are likely to escalate without timely intervention.\n\n4. Discussion\n-------------\n\n### 4.1. Comparative Analysis of LUCs Dynamics: Insights from Western Jilin Province\n\nPrevious research studied LUCs in western Jilin Province, an inland province in China, focusing on conflicts in ecologically fragile areas [[36](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B36-land-14-00249)]. This study chose the GBA, a coastal region, as a new research area, highlighting distinct dynamics compared to western Jilin. The GBA, spanning 56,000 square kilometers, is significantly larger than Jilin’s 4.67 million hectares, requiring additional evaluation indicators to address its complexity. Unlike Jilin’s ecologically fragile zones, the GBA exhibits high-intensity LUCs driven by rapid urbanization and economic growth. Core cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Dongguan prioritize production and living functions due to industrialization and urban expansion, resulting in weak ecological functionality and heightened land-use competition. In contrast, peripheral cities like Zhaoqing and Jiangmen maintain stronger ecological functions and lower conflict levels, forming a clear core-periphery gradient.\n\nTo capture the unique characteristics of the GBA, this study introduced several new indicators. Geomorphic features were included to reflect the region’s diverse terrain, while the NPP index provided a more detailed assessment of land productivity beyond basic land classifications used in Jilin. The critical role of ports in regional production was also considered, recognizing their influence on the GBA’s economic activities. For living functions, POI data for education and medical resources were incorporated to evaluate quality of life from a broader perspective. These additions enhanced the evaluation framework, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the GBA’s land-use dynamics and better addressing its challenges as a globally significant bay area. Several key distinctions emerge between the two regions:\n\n(1)\nFunction Distribution: In Jilin, production functions are weak, with ecological functions dominating in northern and peripheral areas. For example, fragile ecological zones in western Jilin focus on grassland and wetland conservation to mitigate desertification. In contrast, the GBA showcases a highly urbanized structure, where cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen prioritize production and living functions, driven by industrialization and rapid urban growth, often at the expense of ecological functionality.\n\n(2)\nConflict Intensity: In Jilin, LUCs are stable or manageable, such as localized disputes in farming areas or grassland conservation zones. However, the GBA faces escalating pressures, particularly along the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Dongguan axis, where competition between production, living, and ecological functions has led to intensified conflicts, as seen in cases of urban sprawl replacing agricultural and green spaces.\n\n(3)\nHot Spot Distribution: While Jilin’s LUCs hot spots are scattered, often tied to specific conservation projects or localized economic activities (e.g., forestry zones in Changbai Mountain), the GBA’s hot spots are concentrated in dense urban centers like Shenzhen, where global economic activities and industrial hubs amplify land-use tensions.\n\n(4)\nPolicy Implications: Western Jilin’s land-use policies emphasize ecological preservation, such as the “Three North Shelterbelt” program targeting desertification. In contrast, the GBA requires innovative solutions, like multifunctional zoning and cross-border collaborations, to balance urban demands with ecological restoration. Examples include integrating green infrastructure with urban planning in the Guangzhou-Foshan metropolitan area.\n\nBy contrasting these two regions, this study highlights the critical need for context-specific land-use strategies. The lessons from Jilin emphasize the importance of maintaining ecological stability in fragile areas, while the GBA’s findings call for innovative governance frameworks to manage urbanized landscapes and mitigate LUCs. Both cases underscore the value of tailoring land-use management to local dynamics, balancing ecological, economic, and social priorities for sustainable development.\n\n### 4.2. Insights from the GBA’s LUCs and Policy Recommendations\n\n#### 4.2.1. Spatial Distribution and Underlying Drivers of LUCs in the GBA\n\nThe spatial distribution of LUCs in the GBA demonstrates a distinct core-periphery pattern, as revealed in our findings for 2020. Core cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, and Dongguan represent high-conflict zones due to their rapid economic growth, intensive urbanization, and concentrated production and living functions. However, these areas often exhibit weak ecological functions, making them hotspots of LUCs. Urban expansion in these core cities, as noted in related studies, significantly disrupts landscape patterns and reduces habitat quality, leading to ecological vulnerabilities that exacerbate land-use conflicts [[38](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B38-land-14-00249)]. In contrast, peripheral cities like Zhaoqing and Jiangmen experience lower conflict levels, as slower economic development and stronger ecological functions reduce land-use competition. This spatial disparity reflects the combined influence of urbanization, economic development, policy planning, and natural conditions [[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B39-land-14-00249)]. Core cities prioritize production and living functions to support manufacturing, technological innovation, and service industries, intensifying land-use pressures. For instance, the high-density urban expansion in Shenzhen has significantly reduced ecological spaces despite being a center for technological and industrial growth. Conversely, peripheral areas like Zhaoqing maintain a higher proportion of ecological land, highlighting the uneven development patterns within the GBA.\n\nThe findings also underline the role of policy planning in shaping LUCs. National strategies position the GBA as a core region for technological and economic collaboration, incentivizing cities to allocate land for industrial and economic functions. For example, Shenzhen prioritizes land for high-tech industrial parks and business centers, leading to concentrated production functions at the expense of ecological spaces. The lack of coordinated regional land-use policies further exacerbates these conflicts, as cities such as Dongguan and Jiangmen face challenges during industrial transformation and land-use changes. Natural conditions also contribute significantly to the region’s land-use dynamics. Core cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen have limited ecological carrying capacities due to historical urbanization and industrialization, resulting in ecological vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, peripheral cities like Zhaoqing and Jiangmen, with preserved natural areas, maintain stronger ecological functions. This core-periphery contrast underscores the need for balanced development that considers both natural and socio-economic factors.\n\n#### 4.2.2. Insights from Global Bay Areas for Managing LUCs\n\nThe GBA’s LUCs highlight the challenge of balancing production, living, and ecological needs in a densely developed region. Lessons from global bay areas offer valuable strategies, including urban growth boundaries, multifunctional zoning, green infrastructure, and participatory governance. Adapting these measures to the GBA’s unique context can foster sustainable land-use practices, aligning economic growth with ecological and social goals.\n\n(1)\nBalancing Urban Expansion and Ecological Preservation\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area uses urban growth boundaries and strict wetland protection policies to limit development in sensitive ecological zones, effectively balancing economic growth with conservation [[40](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B40-land-14-00249)]. For the GBA, where urban expansion threatens ecological zones in areas like Zhaoqing and Jiangmen, implementing urban growth boundaries and prioritizing wetland and green space protection can help mitigate LUCs and enhance long-term ecological sustainability.\n\n(2)\nIntegrated Zoning and Ecological Restoration\n\nTokyo Bay combines multifunctional zoning with large-scale ecological restoration to manage LUCs. Designating specific zones for industrial, residential, and ecological purposes ensures balanced development, while coastal restoration protects fragile ecosystems [[41](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B41-land-14-00249)]. For the GBA, particularly in cities like Dongguan and Shenzhen, adopting similar zoning practices and restoring degraded ecological areas would address land-use competition and strengthen ecological resilience.\n\n(3)\nGreen Infrastructure for Urban Development\n\nThe New York Bay Area reduces LUCs by integrating green infrastructure, such as urban greenways, rain gardens, and green roofs, into urban planning. These initiatives alleviate ecological pressures while maintaining urban functionality [[42](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B42-land-14-00249)]. In the GBA, high-density areas like Hong Kong and Macao can incorporate green infrastructure to balance urbanization with ecological preservation, creating more sustainable urban environments.\n\n(4)\nParticipatory Land-Use Governance\n\nSydney Bay emphasizes public participation and community-driven planning to manage LUCs effectively. Adaptive policies developed through community consultation address local needs while safeguarding ecological functions [[43](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/2/249#B43-land-14-00249)]. For the GBA, involving local communities in planning decisions can help resolve localized LUCs, particularly in cities like Guangzhou and Foshan, while improving policy acceptance and ensuring sustainable outcomes.\n\n#### 4.2.3. Policy Recommendations for GBA\n\nEffectively addressing LUCs in the GBA requires a thorough understanding of stakeholders, resource requirements, and the challenges associated with implementation. The GBA is characterized by its diversity in development stages and land-use priorities, ranging from urbanized cores like Shenzhen and Guangzhou to peripheral cities like Zhaoqing and Jiangmen. This diversity necessitates the involvement of various stakeholders, including local governments, urban planners, enterprises, environmental NGOs, and community members. Local governments are responsible for enforcing policies and ensuring cross-regional coordination, enterprises are key drivers of industrial transformation and green development, and NGOs and communities play vital roles in ecological restoration and public engagement.\n\nImplementing mitigation strategies for LUCs requires substantial financial and technical resources. For instance, establishing green development funds to support ecological restoration and urban renewal will depend on both public funding and private investment. Advanced technical tools, such as GIS-based conflict diagnostics and ecological restoration technologies, are also crucial to ensure effective and efficient implementation.\n\nHowever, the region faces several challenges, including policy inconsistencies among cities, conflicting priorities among stakeholders, and constraints in funding. Core cities often prioritize economic growth and industrial expansion over ecological protection, while peripheral cities may face limitations in resources and lower levels of public awareness or engagement. Overcoming these challenges requires enhanced coordination mechanisms and tailored strategies that account for the specific needs and conditions of each city and stage of development.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following policy recommendations are proposed to address LUCs in the GBA:\n\n(1)\nEnhancing Cross-Border Collaboration\n\nCross-border collaboration is critical for optimizing resource allocation and reducing LUCs in the GBA. Coordinated policies among Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao can promote the balanced development of production, living, and ecological functions. Core cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan should establish partnerships with peripheral cities like Zhaoqing and Jiangmen to integrate ecological protection into industrial planning. Establishing unified land-use management mechanisms and holding regular interregional discussions on ecological and developmental goals can improve policy coordination and resource efficiency. The creation of a green development fund requires financial input from local governments and private enterprises. However, challenges related to differing regional priorities and fund allocation mechanisms must be addressed through transparent decision-making and consensus-building efforts.\n\n(2)\nImplementing Fine-Grained Land Management\n\nFine-grained land management is essential to addressing LUCs effectively. Utilizing MCE and conflict diagnostics allows differentiated policies to be applied based on the specific needs of each region. Local governments and planning agencies should lead the implementation of these measures, supported by technical expertise from international organizations where needed. For high-conflict zones such as Foshan and Dongguan, stricter controls on land-use changes and financial incentives for transitioning industrial zones into green industries are critical. Evidence from global practices suggests that “land functional zoning” can clarify dominant land-use functions, minimizing conflicts and optimizing land efficiency. However, resistance from industries due to perceived economic costs remains a potential barrier and requires carefully designed incentive structures.\n\n(3)\nPromoting Ecological Restoration and Protection\n\nEcological restoration is crucial for enhancing the ecological carrying capacity of the GBA. Urban renewal initiatives in core cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen should focus on increasing green coverage and developing urban parks to enhance ecological services. Strict ecological redlines and environmental impact assessments must guide land-use decisions to ensure a balance between production, living, and ecological needs. Peripheral cities with stronger ecological functions, such as Zhaoqing, should prioritize preserving these areas to prevent over-development. Municipal governments, environmental NGOs, and private developers must collaborate to secure funding and technical expertise to support large-scale restoration projects. Challenges such as limited enforcement of ecological redlines and the high costs associated with restoration initiatives highlight the need for stronger regulatory mechanisms and financial frameworks.\n\n(4)\nStage-Specific Management Strategies\n\nEffective management of LUCs in the GBA requires a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder roles, resource allocation, and the challenges associated with each stage of conflict intensity. Different stages of LUCs involve varying degrees of stakeholder participation, funding requirements, and distinct levels of potential challenges. Strategies must, therefore, be tailored to address the specific conditions of each stage.:\n\n*   Stable and Controllable Stage\n\nRegions in the stable and controllable stage, such as Zhaoqing and parts of Jiangmen, exhibit low conflict intensity, characterized by balanced land-use functions dominated by ecological lands. These areas face minimal competition among production, living, and ecological functions and the primary goal is to maintain this stability. Ecological preservation should be prioritized through the establishment of nature reserves and the promotion of low-impact activities such as eco-tourism and organic farming. Local governments and environmental NGOs play a central role in implementing these strategies, while community engagement ensures the sustainability of conservation initiatives. These measures require modest financial support, primarily directed toward ecological monitoring, public awareness campaigns, and small-scale reforestation projects. However, challenges include limited public awareness and insufficient coordination among stakeholders, which may undermine the effectiveness of preservation efforts. Long-term ecological planning, including biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration, is crucial to enhancing ecosystem resilience and preventing potential conflicts from emerging in the future.\n\n*   Basic Controllable Stage\n\nModerate conflict zones, such as parts of Huizhou, Dongguan, and Jiangmen, reflect increasing urbanization and industrial transformation, resulting in intensified competition among land-use functions. In these regions, proactive management strategies are required to balance production, living, and ecological functions and to prevent conflicts from escalating. Local governments and planning agencies must collaborate with industrial associations and enterprises to implement multifunctional zoning systems that integrate land uses effectively. For example, developing green industrial parks and eco-urban areas can reduce ecological pressures while sustaining urban productivity. These initiatives require significant investment in green infrastructure, such as urban parks and rainwater gardens, as well as advanced technical expertise for land-use diagnostics and zoning design. Challenges in these regions include resistance from industries to adopt sustainable practices, as well as insufficient inter-city coordination that can impede the consistent application of strategies. Clear policy frameworks that incentivize green development and align urban planning with ecological preservation are essential to address these barriers.\n\n*   Basic Out-of-Control Stage\n\nRegions like the fringes of Guangzhou and Shenzhen face significant land-use conflicts due to heightened competition between production and living functions, leading to ecological degradation and strained land resources. Immediate and decisive interventions are required to prevent further deterioration and to restore ecological balance. Regulatory controls should enforce strict zoning policies to limit urban sprawl and manage industrial expansion. Ecological restoration initiatives, including wetland rehabilitation and urban reforestation, are critical to recovering degraded land and improving ecosystem services. Adaptive urban planning should focus on integrating green spaces into urban designs to enhance land-use efficiency. Implementing these measures demands substantial financial resources and close collaboration among municipal governments, developers, and environmental experts. However, challenges include conflicting priorities between rapid urban growth and ecological preservation, as well as enforcement difficulties in high-growth areas. Strengthened stakeholder coordination and the integration of ecological goals into urban development policies are necessary to overcome these barriers.\n\n*   Serious Out-of-Control Stage\n\nUrban cores like Shenzhen and parts of Guangzhou experience severe conflicts among production, living, and ecological functions, characterized by ecological degradation and resource depletion. These regions require the strongest interventions to prevent irreversible ecological damage and to ensure sustainable land use. Immediate priorities include the protection of critical ecological areas through strict ecological redlines and the halting of development in sensitive zones. Robust measures, such as vertical green infrastructure, ecological compensation systems, and innovative urban planning, must be adopted to alleviate urban and industrial pressures. These measures demand substantial funding and advanced technical expertise to implement large-scale ecological restoration and create innovative urban solutions. Interregional coordination among Hong Kong, Macao, and mainland cities is crucial for managing shared ecological resources and addressing cross-border pressures. However, significant challenges remain, including the high costs of implementation, political complexities arising from multi-regional governance, and resistance from stakeholders prioritizing economic growth over ecological protection. To address these challenges, clear policy mandates, sustained regional collaboration, and long-term investments in green infrastructure and restoration technologies are essential for ensuring ecological sustainability and balanced land-use management.\n\nThe GBA demonstrates a higher intensity of LUCs, particularly in its urbanized cores, driven by rapid economic growth, urbanization, and industrialization. These challenges necessitate stricter zoning policies, enhanced ecological restoration efforts, and stronger interregional coordination mechanisms. Addressing LUCs in the GBA requires adaptive strategies that not only consider the unique challenges of each conflict stage but also align with the involvement of diverse stakeholders, including local governments, enterprises, planning agencies, and community groups. Adequate resources, such as financial investments in green infrastructure and technical expertise for ecological restoration, are essential to ensure the success of these interventions. However, potential barriers, including conflicting stakeholder priorities, policy inconsistencies, and funding constraints, must be proactively addressed. By balancing production, living, and ecological functions, the GBA can achieve sustainable development and serve as a model for integrated land-use management in high-density urban regions.\n\n5. Conclusions\n--------------\n\nThis study constructed a production–living–ecological function-evaluation model using MCE, combined with an intensity diagnostic model, to analyze the spatial distribution and relationships of LUCs intensity and potential in the GBA for 2020. Using hot spot and neighborhood analyses, the following conclusions were drawn:\n\n(1)\nIn 2020, the GBA exhibited relatively high production functionality, moderately high living functionality, and relatively low ecological functionality. High-level production and living function zones were primarily concentrated in the central and southeastern areas, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan. Living functionality in Hong Kong and Macao was also classified as high. Ecological functionality displayed a clear “center-periphery” distribution pattern, weakening in urban cores like Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan and strengthening in peripheral areas such as Zhaoqing and Jiangmen.\n\n(2)\nThe proportions of the stable and controllable stage, basic controllable stage, basic out-of-control stage, and serious out-of-control stage accounted for 39.22%, 28.73%, 25.41%, and 6.64% of the study area, respectively. Hot spots of LUC intensity were concentrated in the central-eastern part of the GBA, particularly in Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen, and Dongguan, where high urbanization and industrial activities dominate. Cold spots were primarily distributed in peripheral regions such as Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, and Macao, where lower economic activity and stronger ecological functions reduce conflict levels.\n\n(3)\nThe study area faced varying degrees of conflict potential, with low, general, high, and extreme potential zones occupying 47.88%, 23.43%, 22.14%, and 6.54% of the total area, respectively. Extreme conflict potential was concentrated in the central areas of Dongguan and Jiangmen, as well as the urban cores of Zhaoqing and Zhongshan. High-potential conflict zones were distributed across Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, Huizhou, Hong Kong, and Macao. Hot spots of conflict potential overlapped with administrative boundary areas such as “Foshan–Zhaoqing”, “Foshan–Jiangmen”, and “Guangzhou–Zhongshan”, highlighting areas of intensified land-use competition.\n\nThe GBA plays a pivotal role in driving China’s economic development, characterized by rapid urbanization and intensive industrial activity. The findings of this study underscore the importance of balancing economic growth with ecological sustainability to address the region’s complex land-use challenges. Given its critical economic mission, the GBA requires land-use strategies that balance growth with sustainability. Policy frameworks should emphasize integrated planning to manage conflicts in high-pressure zones while preserving ecological integrity in less-developed areas. This balance is essential not only for the GBA’s sustainable development but also as a model for managing land-use conflicts in other high-density urban regions. Future research should further refine evaluation methods and indicators to enhance the understanding of LUC dynamics and support effective, evidence-based policymaking. The urgency of addressing land-use conflicts in the GBA cannot be overstated, as timely and effective actions are critical to ensuring long-term regional sustainability.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n--------------------\n\nConceptualization, Z.C.; methodology, Z.C.; software, Z.C.; validation, J.Y.; formal analysis, Z.C.; resources, Z.C.; data curation, Z.C.; writing—original draft preparation, Z.C.; writing—review and editing, D.X. and J.Y.; project administration, D.X.; funding acquisition, D.X. and J.Y.

Administration](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/images/BlackWhite-bungalow.jpg)\n\nIn land scarce Singapore, optimising the use of land resources is integral to sustaining Singapore’s economic and social growth.\n\nMinLaw formulates and reviews the following policies to support the optimal use of land resources:\n\n*   **Residential Property Act**\n    *   The [Residential Property Act (RPA)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/RPA1976) strikes a balance between ensuring that the limited supply of landed residential properties in Singapore remains the primary preserve of Singapore Citizens, whilst allowing selected foreigners who have demonstrated social commitment and are making a significant economic contribution to Singapore to also own landed homes. Foreigners who wish to purchase landed residential properties have to submit an application to the Land Dealings Approval Unit at the [Singapore Land Authority (SLA)](https://www1.sla.gov.sg/).\n    *   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to [purchase of landed residential property by foreigners under the RPA.](http://www.ifaq.gov.sg/sla/mobile/index.aspx#Docs/9005)\n\n*   **Land Acquisition Act**\n    *   The [Land Acquisition Act (LAA)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/LAA1966) is a key legislation that enables the compulsory acquisition of private land for public purposes, such as the building of transportation infrastructure and public housing. Landowners whose lands are acquired are paid market value compensation under the LAA. \n\n*   **Land Titles (Strata) Act**\n    *   The sale of private strata developments in en bloc sales, or collective sales, facilitates redevelopment and supports urban rejuvenation. The requirements and procedures for an en bloc sale by majority consent are governed by the [Land Titles (Strata) Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/LTSA1967).\n    *   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to [collective sale](https://www.stratatb.gov.sg/faq-ltsa.html#/).\n\nMinLaw is also the guardian of State land. Its Statutory Board, the [Singapore Land Authority (SLA)](https://www.sla.gov.sg/), manages approximately 11,000 hectares of State land and 5,000 State buildings.\n\nSLA provides the following land administration services:\n\n*   **Selling and leasing land to the public and private sector, and allocating land to support national development**\n    *   The SLA facilitates the sale and leasing of State land to both the public and private sectors for various uses, such as public housing, industrial development, community uses. The integrity of the land allocation and administration process is critical to meet ever-changing socio-economic needs, and to maintain confidence in land transactions. \n\n*   **Registration of land and property transactions and the issuance and guarantee of land titles in Singapore**\n    *   Land rights are of vital social and economic importance, because they form the basis on which many economic and business activities can take place. The high level of home and property ownership in Singapore also necessitates a secure land titles registration system. Land titles records are maintained by the SLA, the national land registration authority for property transactions and the issuance and guarantee of land titles in Singapore.\n\n*   **Managing and collating digitised information on Singapore's roads and MRT networks, property boundaries, outlines of public housing and industrial buildings**\n    *   SLA makes available information to the public through the following services:\n    *   [OneMap](https://www.onemap.sg/main/v2/)\n\n OneMap is an integrated online geospatial platform that provides reliable, timely and accurate location-based information and services to the public. Use OneMap for street directory information as well as services such as LandQuery, SchoolQuery and PopulationQuery, amongst others.\n    *   [Integrated Land Information Service (INLIS)](https://app1.sla.gov.sg/inlis/#/)\n\n Use this one-stop internet portal which provides information on land matters such as road line plans, survey plans and property boundaries. In addition, INLIS provides information on property such as ownership of property, property transaction history and surrounding amenities.\n\n*   **Maintaining the national land survey system**\n    *   SLA administers the national land survey system which provides the fundamental information about land in Singapore. It establishes and maintains geodetic reference system and infrastructure to support all land survey and geospatial activities. SLA regulates the process of property boundaries survey (known as the cadastral survey), which is now based on co-ordinates. The [Land Surveyors Board](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/lsb/en.html) provides for the registration of surveyors. It is also responsible for setting and maintaining standards for registered surveyors, and regulating and advancing the practice of land surveying in Singapore.\n\n**Video: Land Policy and

To promote resilient and sustainable economic development, we have adopted an open economy conducive to foreign investments and international trade since our independence in 1965. This has allowed us to transform from a third world economy into a global business hub over the years, with substantive activities across diverse sectors.\n\nLocated at the crossroads between the East and West, Singapore is an attractive location for global businesses to access new and emerging markets in Asia. With our excellent infrastructure, robust and transparent regulatory environment, political stability, skilled workforce, and a stable and efficient tax regime, Singapore has become a trusted hub for many businesses, with manufacturing being one of the largest sectors in our economy. Our Corporate Income Tax system has features that encourage enterprise, growth, and internationalisation.\n\n#### **Start-up Tax Exemption Scheme**\n\nIncome derived by companies in Singapore is taxed at a flat rate of 17%. The start-up tax exemption scheme encourages entrepreneurship by providing newly incorporated companies some exemption on their taxable profits in their first three years of operation. Please refer to IRAS’ website for more details on the [start-up tax exemption scheme and the qualifying conditions](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-rate-rebates-and-tax-exemption-schemes).\n\n#### **Partial Tax Exemption Scheme**\n\nThe Government recognises that small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are an important component of a vibrant economy. To help such companies grow and establish themselves, the Government has put in place a partial tax exemption scheme designed to support SMEs. Please refer to IRAS' website for more details on the [partial tax exemption scheme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-rate-rebates-and-tax-exemption-schemes).\n\n#### Group Relief\n\nAs companies grow and expand their operations, they may organise themselves as multiple holding companies, subsidiaries and associate companies to manage liabilities. Under Singapore’s group relief system, current year unutilised losses, donations and unabsorbed capital allowances may be transferred to related companies within the group. This reduces the overall tax burden for the whole group. Please refer to IRAS' website for more details on the [group relief system](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-reliefs/group-relief).\n\n#### **Mergers & Acquisitions (“M&A”) Scheme**\n\nThe M&A scheme aims to facilitate mergers and acquisitions, with a focus on developing a vibrant and dynamic SME sector. Please refer to IRAS' website for further details of the [M&A scheme and qualifying criteria](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-allowances/mergers-acquisitions-(m-a)-allowance).\n\n#### **Double Tax Deduction for Internationalisation Scheme**\n\nThe Double Tax Deduction for Internationalisation (“DTDi”) scheme provides support to businesses as they venture into international markets. Please refer to IRAS' website for[more details on DTDi](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses/double-tax-deduction-for-internationalisation-scheme).\n\nIn Singapore, taxes are imposed on income derived from or accrued in Singapore, as well as foreign-sourced income received in Singapore. Companies may qualify for foreign tax credit to offset the taxes payable on foreign-sourced income. To allow businesses to claim foreign tax credit in a more administratively efficient manner, the Government has introduced the foreign-sourced income exemption (FSIE) regime.\n\n###### **Conditions to be met**\n\nUnder the FSIE regime, foreign-sourced dividends, branch profits and service income (collectively \"specified foreign-sourced income\") derived by any person who is a tax resident in Singapore is exempted from tax if the following conditions are met:\n\n*   the specified foreign-sourced income has been subjected to tax in the foreign jurisdiction from which the income is received;\n*   the headline tax rate of the foreign jurisdiction from which the specified foreign-sourced income is received is at least 15% at the time the foreign income is received in Singapore; and\n*   the Comptroller of Income Tax is satisfied that the tax exemption would be beneficial to the person resident in Singapore.\n\n###### **What if the conditions are not met?**\n\nWhere the above general conditions are not met, tax exemption may be granted under section 13(12) of the Income Tax Act, for foreign-sourced income under the scenarios specified in the IRAS e-tax guide on “[Income Tax: Tax Exemption under Section 13(12) for Specified Scenarios, Real Estate Investment Trusts and Qualifying Offshore Infrastructure Project/Asset](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/e-tax-guides?taxtype=&industries=&topics=&years=&keyword=section%2013(12)&sort=datedesc&page=1&pg=1&taxtypes=Corporate%2BIncome%2BTax)”.\n\nThe declaration form to avail of section 13(12) tax exemption under the specified scenarios is in the IRAS e-tax guide.\n\nOtherwise, any exemption may only be granted on a case-by-case basis, upon application.The application form can be found [here](https://www.mof.gov.sg/schemes/businesses).\n\nPlease refer to IRAS' website for more information on the [FSIE regime](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income).\n\n###### **What is Foreign Tax Credit Pooling?**\n\nForeign Tax Credit Pooling was introduced in 2011 to give businesses greater flexibility on their claims for foreign tax credit.\n\n###### **What conditions must be met?**\n\nTo claim Foreign Tax Credit Pooling, the following conditions must be met:\n\n*   income tax is paid on the income in the foreign jurisdiction from which the income is derived;\n*   the headline tax rate of the foreign jurisdiction from which the income is received is at least 15% at the time the foreign income is received in Singapore; and\n*   there is Singapore income tax payable on the foreign income and the taxpayer is entitled to claim for foreign tax credit under the Income Tax Act.\n\nPlease refer to IRAS' website for more details on the [Foreign Tax Credit Pooling system](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-reliefs/foreign-tax-credit).\n\nSingapore uses tax incentives as one of the tools to encourage new and high-growth activities.Tax incentives are legislated and reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant.\n\nTax incentives are administered by Singapore’s economic agencies. The incentives are granted for a limited period to businesses that conduct substantive activities or have substantive business plans to establish or expand their operations in Singapore, for income arising from qualifying activities.Income arising from non-qualifying activities will be taxed at the Corporate Income Tax rate. Read more on [tax incentives](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/applying-for-tax-incentives) on IRAS’ website\n\nIncentive recipients are:\n\n*   required to significantly contribute to the deepening of activities and/or creation of new capabilities and high-value skilled employment in Singapore; and\n*   subject to regular reviews of their economic contributions for the qualifying activities.\n\nAn incentive recipient needs to meet the committed contributions to continue enjoying its incentive award.\n\nTo continue encouraging Singaporeans to give back to the community and to provide strong support for the charity sector, the Minister for Finance announced in Budget 2023 that 250% tax deductions for qualifying donations will be extended for another three years until 31 December 2026.\n\nTable 1 below further elaborates on the types of donations that will be granted the 250% tax deduction.\n\nTable 1: Qualifying Donations for 250% Tax Deductions\n\n**Donation Scheme****Eligible Recipient****Eligible Donor**\nCash donations for local causes Institutions of Public Character (IPCs) and the Singapore Government All donors\nGift of shares listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) or of units in unit trusts traded in Singapore IPCs Individual donors only\nGifts of artefacts Approved museums by the National Heritage Board (NHB)All donors\nDonation of public sculptures NHB or NHB-approved recipients All donors\nGifts of parcels of land or buildings IPCs All donors\n\nIn addition, from 1 Jan 2005, the following donations with naming opportunities will be granted the 250% tax deduction::\n\n1.   Donations to name IPCs, IPC facilities, events or programmes,\n\n2.   Donations to name facilities of approved beneficiaries (including artefacts and public sculptures) under any of the other approved donation programmes,\n\n3.   Donations under any of the approved donation programme where the IPC or approved beneficiary acknowledges the donation by including the donor's name or logo in the IPC's collaterals (e.g. banners, publications, advertisements).\n\nThe 250% tax deduction will not be given in cases where the donor is advertising at the IPC facility, event or programme. Donors displaying their banners, products, or other collaterals at the IPC facility, event, or programme to which it has donated is regarded as advertising or marketing expenses and not a donation.\n\nOther forms of in-kind donations that do not fall under Table 1 or are not eligible naming opportunities as indicated above will not be awarded the 250% tax deduction.\n\n###### Tax deductions for overseas donations\n\nTo encourage greater philanthropic giving among Single Family Offices and the growth of philanthropic capabilities in Singapore, the Minister for Finance introduced the Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme for Family Offices (PTIS) at Budget 2023. Qualifying donors approved under the PTIS can claim 100% tax deduction for overseas donations made through qualifying local intermediaries for a period of five years starting from an approved incentive commencement date within the period 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2028. The tax deduction is capped at 40% of the approved qualifying donor’s statutory income. Please refer to MAS' website for [more information on the PTIS](https://www.mas.gov.sg/schemes-and-initiatives/philanthropy-tax-incentive-scheme-for-family-offices).\n\nTo encourage Singaporeans to support those in need overseas, the Minister for Finance announced at Budget 2024 the pilot of the Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Tax Deduction Scheme (OHAS). Under the OHAS, corporate and individual donors can claim 100% tax deduction for qualifying cash donations made towards approved overseas emergency humanitarian assistance causes made through designated charities with a valid Fund-Raising For Foreign Charitable Purposes permit from the Commissioner of Charities during the period 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2028. The tax deduction is capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income, with the cap shared with the PTIS.\n",

Through this movement, the skills, passion and contributions of every individual will drive Singapore's next phase of development towards an advanced economy and inclusive society.\n\nInvestment in human capital through education and training has been at the heart of Singapore’s progress, and has also helped Singaporeans develop and maximise their potential. By enabling a highly-skilled and competitive workforce, it has allowed Singaporeans to secure better jobs, higher incomes and enjoy higher standards of living.\n\nContinuous education and training remain core to our society and economy today and for the future. With the fast pace of technological advancements and stronger global competition for jobs, skills upgrading and deepening are essential for Singaporeans to maintain a competitive edge.\n\nAs our economy restructures and companies find ways to innovate and enhance productivity, the demand for higher-skilled workers will also increase.\n\nGiven these trends, the workplace must be a major site of learning, where every Singaporean is able to continue to develop themselves throughout their careers and through life.\n\nThe tripartite SkillsFuture Council, led by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, will coordinate and drive a national effort to help Singaporeans develop skills relevant to the future, and build a future based on the mastery of skills in every job. SkillsFuture encapsulates the impetus for Singapore to move towards an advanced economy and society, where individuals go beyond competence to attaining expertise and mastery of skills, motivated not just by current demands of their job but by a dedication to excellence and passion in each individual’s own area of strength and interest. It also embodies the spirit of lifelong learning, respect for skills in every job, and celebrating the skills and growth of every individual, no matter their background, age or qualifications.\n\nFour key areas of focus under the SkillsFuture Council are:\n\n1.   Helping individuals make well-informed choices in education, training and careers.\n2.   Developing an integrated, high-quality system of education and training that responds to constantly evolving industry needs.\n3.   Promoting employer recognition and career development based on skills and mastery.\n4.   Fostering a culture that supports and celebrates lifelong learning.\n\nIn line with SkillsFuture, the Ministry of Manpower, together with Workforce Singapore, the Ministry of Education and other economic agencies in government, are developing an integrated system of education and training to provide all Singaporeans with the enhanced opportunities to acquire greater skills proficiency, knowledge and expertise.\n\nFor continuing education and training (CET), workers can sign up for programmes and courses under the Singapore Workforce Qualifications System (WSQ) to upgrade their skills and enhance their employability.\n\nFor more info, please visit the [SkillsFuture website](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/).\n",

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, GDP grew marginally by 0.1 per cent, slower than the 0.8 per cent growth in the third quarter. The services producing industries collectively grew by 4.0 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, easing from the 5.5 per cent growth in the previous quarter. All services sectors expanded during the quarter, except for the finance & insurance sector, which contracted slightly by 0.3 per cent. Among the sectors that grew, the food & beverage services (19.6 per cent) and real estate (15.2 per cent) sectors posted the strongest expansions. The construction sector grew by 10.0 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, an improvement from the 8.1 per cent growth in the third quarter. Growth during the quarter was supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. \n\n## Full Year of 2022 \n\nFor the whole of 2022, the Singapore economy expanded by 3.6 per cent, moderating from the 8.9 per cent growth in 2021 (Exhibit 1.2). By sectors, the manufacturing sector grew by 2.5 per cent in 2022, a marked slowdown from the 13.3 per cent growth achieved in the preceding year. Growth in the sector for the year was supported by output expansions across all clusters, except for the chemicals and biomedical manufacturing clusters. Services producing industries posted growth of 4.8 per cent in 2022, easing from the 7.6 per cent expansion in 2021. All services sectors registered full-year expansions, with the food & beverage services (18.2 per cent) and real estate (14.1 per cent) sectors recording the fastest growth in 2022. Meanwhile, the construction sector grew by 6.7 per cent in 2022, extending the 20.5 per cent expansion in the preceding year. Output growth in the sector was supported by an increase in both public and private sector construction works. The manufacturing sector contracted by 2.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, a pullback from the 1.1 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. All clusters within the sector recorded contractions during the quarter, except for the transport engineering and precision engineering clusters. \n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Singapore economy grew by 2.1 per cent on a year-on-year basis, moderating from the 4.0 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. All sectors expanded during the quarter, with the exception of the manufacturing and finance & insurance sectors. The sectors that contributed the most to growth during the quarter were the other services, wholesale trade and real estate sectors. For the full year, the Singapore economy grew by 3.6 per cent, slower than the 8.9 per cent expansion in 2021. All sectors recorded full-year expansions, with the wholesale trade, manufacturing and other services sectors contributing the most to GDP growth for the year. \n\nExhibit 1.1: GDP and Sectoral Growth Rates in 4Q 2022        \n\n> Per Cent\n> -10 -5 0510 15 20 25\n> Manufacturing Finance & Insurance Overall GDP Growth Wholesale Trade Transportation & Storage Retail Trade Information & Comms Other Services Industries Professional Services Accommodation Construction Administrative & Support Real Estate Food & Beverage Services\n> 2.5 5.1 5.6 6.0 10.0 6.1 10.5 15.2 19.6 7.8 2.4 2.1 -0.3 -2.6 Chapter 1: Economic Performance\n\n07 Exhibit 1.2: GDP and Sectoral Growth Rates in 2022 Exhibit 1.4: Percentage-Point Contribution to Growth in Real GDP in 2022 (By Sectors) \n\n> Per Cent\n\n0 1 2 3 4\n\nAccommodation Retail Trade Food & Beverage Services Construction Finance & Insurance Administrative & Support Transportation & Storage Real Estate Professional Services Information & Comms Other Services Industries Manufacturing Wholesale Trade Overall GDP Growth \n\n> 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.6 3.6 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.0\n\nExhibit 1.3: Percentage-Point Contribution to Growth in Real GDP in 4Q 2022 (By Sectors) \n\n> Per Cent\n\n-1 0 1 2 3\n\nManufacturing Finance & Insurance Accommodation Retail Trade Food & Beverage Services Transportation & Storage Construction Information & Comms Administrative & Support Professional Services Real Estate Wholesale Trade Other Services Industries Overall GDP Growth \n\n> 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.6 2.1 0.3 0.1 0.0 0.0 -0.5\n> Per Cent\n\n0 5 10 15 20 \n\nAccommodation Finance & Insurance Manufacturing Wholesale Trade Overall GDP Growth Transportation & Storage Other Services Industries Administrative & Support Construction Professional Services Retail Trade Information & Comms Real Estate Food & Beverage Services \n\n> 3.6 4.0 5.2 6.7 8.6 14.1 18.2 7.6 3.2 2.5 1.4 0.5 8.4 6.6\n\n## Contribution to Growth \n\nIn the fourth quarter, all sectors contributed positively to GDP growth, except for the manufacturing and finance & insurance sectors (Exhibit 1.3). Among the sectors that expanded, the other services, wholesale trade and real estate sectors were the top contributors to GDP growth during the quarter. For the whole of 2022, all sectors contributed positively to GDP growth, with the wholesale trade, manufacturing and other services sectors contributing the most to GDP growth for the year (Exhibit 1.4).

This was due to a fall in external demand during the quarter, which was partially offset by a rise in domestic demand. For 2022 as a whole, total demand edged up by 0.1 per cent, weakening from the 11.1 per cent increase in 2021. Growth in total demand was supported by a rise in domestic demand (1.1 percentage-points) even as external demand declined (-1.0 percentage-points). \n\n## External Demand \n\nExternal demand shrank by 7.0 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, a sharp pullback from the 3.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter (Exhibit 1.6). The slump in external demand could be attributed to a contraction in the real exports of both goods and services. For the full year, external demand contracted by 1.3 per cent, a reversal from the 11.7 per cent expansion in 2021. The drop in external demand could be attributed to a fall in real services exports, which was in turn due to a contraction in the real exports of transport services. By contrast, real merchandise exports rose, led by the real exports of machinery and transport equipment. \n\n## Domestic Demand \n\nTotal domestic demand rose by 4.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, an improvement from the 2.8 per cent growth in the previous quarter. The pickup in domestic demand during the quarter was supported by an increase in consumption expenditure, which more than offset a fall in gross fixed capital formation. For 2022 as a whole, total domestic demand expanded by 4.3 per cent, moderating from the 9.4 per cent growth in 2021. The increase in domestic demand was supported by growth in both consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation, even as inventories declined. \n\n## Consumption Expenditure \n\nTotal consumption expenditure rose by 6.7 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 7.9 per cent increase in the previous quarter. For the full year, total consumption expenditure picked up by 6.5 per cent, faster than the 5.8 per cent growth in 2021. The increase in consumption expenditure was driven by an expansion in private consumption which outweighed a decline in public consumption. Specifically, private consumption rose by 9.7 per cent, attributable in part to an increase in expenditure on miscellaneous goods & services and recreation & culture. At the same time, public consumption fell by 2.3 per cent, a reversal from the 3.7 per cent expansion in 2021.

The decline in GFCF during the quarter was on account of a fall in private GFCF (-1.8 per cent), which outstripped an increase in public GFCF (2.0 per cent). For the full year, GFCF rose by 1.6 per cent, a sharp moderation from the 18.0 per cent increase in 2021 (Exhibit 1.7). Public GFCF decreased by 1.8 per cent, a reversal from the 21.5 per cent growth in 2021, weighed down mainly by lower investment spending on machinery & equipment (Exhibit 1.8). Meanwhile, private GFCF rose by 2.3 per cent, slower than the 17.3 per cent expansion in 2021. The increase in private GFCF was due to higher investment spending across all components except for private construction & works. \n\n# INCOME COMPONENTS OF NOMINAL GDP \n\nSingapore’s nominal GDP amounted to $644 billion in 2022, a 13.0 per cent increase over 2021. Gross operating surplus accounted for 57.7 per cent of nominal GDP, while compensation of employees accounted for 36.6 per cent (Exhibit 1.9). Taxes (less subsidies) on production and imports made up the remaining 5.8 per cent of nominal GDP. \n\n# NATIONAL SAVING \n\nWith factor income outflows exceeding inflows by $104 billion, Gross National Income (GNI) came in at $540 billion in 2022, lower than the $644 billion in nominal GDP. Gross National Savings (GNS) increased by 13.5 per cent to $265 billion in 2022.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, GDP grew by 0.5 per cent, slower than the 3.0 per cent growth in the third quarter. The services producing industries collectively grew by 4.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, slightly faster than the 4.4 per cent growth in the previous quarter. All services sectors expanded during the quarter, except for the retail trade, administrative & support services and food & beverage services sectors. Among the services sectors that grew, the wholesale trade (6.7 per cent) and finance & insurance (6.1 per cent) sectors posted the fastest growth. The construction sector grew by 4.4 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, slower than the 5.6 per cent growth in the third quarter. Output growth during the quarter was supported by an increase in both public sector and private sector construction works. \n\nFull Year of 2024 \n\nFor the whole of 2024, the Singapore economy grew by 4.4 per cent, faster than the 1.8 per cent expansion in 2023 (Exhibit 1.2).

Growth during the quarter was due to increases in both external and domestic demand. For 2024 as a whole, total demand increased by 5.9 per cent, strengthening from the 3.8 per cent growth in 2023. The increase in total demand was supported by a rise in both external demand (4.0 percentage-points) and domestic demand (1.8 percentage-points). \n\nExternal Demand \n\nExternal demand rose by 3.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, easing from the 4.4 per cent expansion in the previous quarter (Exhibit 1.6). The rise in external demand could be attributed to an increase in the real exports of goods, even as the real exports of services fell. For the full year, external demand expanded by 5.4 per cent, slightly slower than the 5.7 per cent expansion in 2023. The increase in external demand could be attributed to increases in both real merchandise and services exports. In turn, these were led by higher real exports of machinery & transport equipment and financial services respectively. \n\nDomestic Demand \n\nTotal domestic demand rose by 8.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, faster than the 7.6 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. The increase in domestic demand during the quarter was due to increases in inventories, consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation. For 2024 as a whole, total domestic demand rose by 7.2 per cent, a rebound from the 2.2 per cent contraction in 2023. The rise in domestic demand was due to increases in consumption expenditure, inventories and gross fixed capital formation. \n\nConsumption Expenditure \n\nTotal consumption expenditure rose by 5.3 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, slower than the 6.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter. For the full year, total consumption expenditure rose by 5.7 per cent, faster than the 4.1 per cent growth in 2023. Consumption expenditure growth was due to both private and public consumption. Private consumption rose by 4.8 per cent, led by increases in transport, health and miscellaneous goods & services. At the same time, public consumption rose by 8.3 per cent, accelerating from the 1.8 per cent expansion in 2023.

GFCF rose during the quarter on account of increases in public GFCF (10.8 per cent) and private GFCF (3.6 per cent). For the full year, GFCF rose by 2.9 per cent, a turnaround from the 0.9 per cent contraction in 2023 (Exhibit 1.7). Private GFCF increased by 0.8 per cent, a reversal from the 1.7 per cent contraction in 2023, mainly due to higher investment spending on intellectual property products (Exhibit 1.8). Meanwhile, public GFCF rose by 12.4 per cent, accelerating from the 3.1 per cent expansion in 2023. The increase in public GFCF was due to higher investment spending across all components. \n\n## INCOME COMPONENTS OF NOMINAL GDP \n\nSingapore’s nominal GDP amounted to $731 billion in 2024, a 7.8 per cent increase over 2023. Gross operating surplus accounted for 54.9 per cent of nominal GDP, while compensation of employees accounted for 37.8 per cent (Exhibit 1.9). Taxes (less subsidies) on production and imports made up the remaining 7.3 per cent of nominal GDP. \n\n## NATIONAL SAVING \n\nWith factor income outflows exceeding inflows by $119 billion, Gross National Income (GNI) came in at $613 billion in 2024, lower than the $731 billion in nominal GDP. Gross National Saving (GNS) increased by 10.0 per cent to $291 billion in 2024. This comprised a net outflow of $128 billion that was lent or transferred abroad, and $162 billion in Gross Capital Formation. The national savings rate was 47.5 per cent of GNI in 2024, slightly lower than the 47.7 per cent in 2023. \n\nTotal Public Private Total 2.9 2.3 0.6 \n\nConstruction & Works 1.4 1.9 -0.5 \n\nTransport Equipment 0.5 0.0 0.4 \n\nMachinery & Equipment 0.5 0.3 0.2 \n\nIntellectual Property Products 0.6 0.0 0.6 Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n10 Exhibit 1.10: Singapore’s Earnings from External Economy as a Proportion of Total Income \n\n0510 15 20 25 30 \n\n2024 2019 2014 2009 2004 \n\n> Per Cent Factor Income From Abroad (FIFA) GDP + FIFA\n\n## GNI AND THE EXTERNAL ECONOMY \n\nFactor income from abroad reached $267 billion in 2024, up from the $221 billion in 2023.

Across the broad sectors, employment gains were registered in the services (+50,900) and construction (+11,300) sectors, while the manufacturing (-500) sector posted a decline. Resident employment growth in 2024 is expected to be higher than in 2023, when resident employment declined. In contrast, non-resident employment growth in 2024 is expected to slow considerably from 2023. 2\n\n## UNEMPLOYMENT \n\nBetween September and December 2024, the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate at the overall level was unchanged (1.9 per cent), while the resident and citizen unemployment rates rose marginally, from 2.6 per cent to 2.8 per cent and from 2.7 per cent to 2.9 per cent respectively (Exhibit 2.3). In December 2024, there were 67,500 unemployed residents, of whom 59,700 were Singapore citizens. This was an increase from the 62,500 and 54,900 unemployed residents and Singapore citizens in September 2024, respectively. For the full year of 2024, the annual average unemployment rate increased slightly at the overall level (from 1.9 per cent in 2023 to 2.0 per cent), as well as for residents (from 2.7 per cent to 2.8 per cent), but was unchanged for citizens (2.9 per cent). In 2024, 67,600 residents, of whom 59,300 were Singapore citizens, were unemployed. These were marginally higher than their respective figures in 2023 (65,700 and 58,200). \n\n## RETRENCHMENTS \n\nThe number of retrenchments rose in the fourth quarter (3,600), compared to the third quarter (3,050). Over the quarter, the increase in retrenchments in the services (from 2,220 to 2,800) and manufacturing (from 580 to 700) sectors outweighed the decline in retrenchments in the construction (from 140 to 100) sector. The total number of retrenchments for 2024 (12,930) fell from the 14,590 retrenchments registered in 2023. The number of retrenchments fell across all broad sectors, led by the manufacturing (from 3,470 to 2,630) sector, followed by the services sectors collectively (from 10,440 to 9,720) and the construction (from 590 to 460) sector.  \n\n> 2Further details of the breakdown of employment growth in the fourth quarter and full year for 2024, including by resident status, will be released by MOM in the Labour Market Report Fourth Quarter 2024 in mid-March 2025. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024\n\n16 3 Outward-oriented sectors refer to manufacturing, wholesale trade, transportation & storage, accommodation, information & communications, finance & insurance and professional services. Domestically-oriented sectors refer to construction, retail trade, food & beverage services, real estate, administrative & support services and other services industries. \n\nExhibit 2.4: Changes in Value-Added per Actual Hour Worked for the Overall Economy Exhibit 2.5: Changes in Value-Added per Actual Hour Worked by Industry in 2024     \n\n> -4 -2 02468\n> 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020\n> Per Cent\n> Per Cent\n> -5 0510 15\n> Administrative & Support Real Estate Other Services Industries Retail Trade Food & Beverage Services Professional Services Construction Overall Productivity Finance & Insurance Accommodation Wholesale Trade Manufacturing Transportation & Storage Information & Comms\n> -0.5 1.1 1.4 3.0 3.6 5.0 5.5 6.4 10.5 -2.3 6.1 5.1 1.9 -0.9\n\n## PRODUCTIVITY \n\nReal Value-Added per Actual Hour Worked \n\nOverall labour productivity, as measured by real value-added per actual hour worked, rose by 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, extending the 4.5 per cent increase in the previous quarter. By sectors, the productivity of the wholesale trade, manufacturing, information & communications, construction, real estate, accommodation, transportation & storage, finance & insurance and food & beverage services sectors rose in the fourth quarter. By contrast, the productivity of the administrative & support services, professional services, other services and retail trade sectors fell. Collectively, the productivity of outward-oriented sectors increased by 4.8 per cent in the fourth quarter, while that of domestically-oriented sectors rose by 0.3 per cent over the same period. 3For the full year, real value-added per actual hour worked grew by 3.6 per cent, reversing the 1.5 per cent decline in 2023 (Exhibit 2.4). The productivity performance for the overall economy was supported by productivity improvements across most sectors, with the information & communications sector experiencing the largest gains in productivity. By contrast, productivity fell in the administrative & support services, real estate and other services sectors (Exhibit 2.5). \n\nReal Value-Added per Worker \n\nReal value-added per worker rose by 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, continuing the 4.2 per cent increase in the preceding quarter. For 2024, real value-added per worker rose by 2.7 per cent, reversing the decline of 2.7 per cent in 2023. The weaker performance of real value-added per worker compared to real value-added per actual hour worked in 2024 was because of a decline in the average number of actual hours worked per worker during the year.

Median nominal gross monthly income (including employer CPF contributions) of full-time employed residents grew by 5.8 per cent to $5,500, an increase from the 2.5 per cent growth in 2023. After adjusting for inflation 4, real median income rose by 3.4 per cent in 2024. Lower-income earners also saw an increase in their incomes after taking inflation into account, with real income at the 20th percentile growing by 4.6 per cent in 2024. With WIS and related payments included, real income at the 20th percentile saw a smaller increase (4.0 per cent). Over the last five years (i.e., June 2019 to June 2024), real median income rose by 0.7 per cent per annum (Exhibit 2.6). During this period, real income growth at the 20th percentile was stronger (1.2 per cent per annum), thus narrowing the income gap with the median income earner.  \n\n> 4The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items rose by 2.4 per cent in 2024.

The pickup in overall ULC during the quarter came on the back of an increase in total labour cost per worker that outpaced the rise in labour productivity (as measured by real value-added per worker). By broad sectors, the ULC of services producing industries rose by 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, faster than the 1.2 per cent increase in the previous quarter. Most services sectors saw a pickup in their ULCs, with the food & beverage services sector registering the largest increase (8.0 per cent) on account of an increase in total labour cost per worker and a decline in labour productivity. Meanwhile, the construction sector registered a ULC increase of 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, a reversal from the 0.1 per cent decrease in the previous quarter. The increase in ULC in the construction sector was due to an increase in total labour cost per worker which outpaced an increase in labour productivity. The ULC for the manufacturing sector fell by 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, following the 8.1 per cent decline in the third quarter. This decline was due to an increase in labour productivity, which more than offset an increase in total labour cost per worker. For the whole of 2024, the overall ULC rose at a slower pace of 1.2 per cent, compared to the 6.5 per cent increase in 2023. The rise in overall ULC was due to an increase in total labour cost per worker that outpaced labour productivity gains. \n\nExhibit 3.1: Changes in Unit Labour Cost in 4Q 2024    \n\n> Per Cent\n> 8.0 7.5 6.4 5.0 1.6 -1.9 1.0 -2.2 -2.8 3.6 2.7 5.8 1.3 -2.8 -5 0510\n> Transportation & Storage Information & Comms Wholesale Trade Manufacturing Overall Economy Construction Real Estate Finance & Insurance Accommodation Professional Services Retail Trade Other Services Industries Administrative & Support Food & Beverage\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nOverall ULC for the economy rose by 1.0 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, reversing the decline of 0.4 per cent in the preceding quarter. For the whole of 2024, overall ULC rose by 1.2 per cent. Total investment commitments attracted by EDB remained healthy in 2024. The manufacturing sector garnered a larger amount of commitments in terms of fixed asset investments (FAI) than the services sector, while the latter attracted a larger amount of total business expenditure (TBE) commitments. By clusters, the electronics and biomedical manufacturing clusters within the manufacturing sector were the biggest contributors to FAI commitments, while the headquarters & professional services cluster within the services sector contributed the most to TBE commitments. The Consumer Price Index-All Items (CPI-All Items) rose by 1.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, moderating from the 2.2 per cent increase in the previous quarter. For 2024 as a whole, CPI-All Items inflation came in at 2.4 per cent, lower than the 4.8 per cent recorded in 2023. Producer prices, as measured by the domestic supply price index (DSPI), the Singapore manufactured products price index (SMPPI) as well as the import and export price indices, fell on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. For the whole of 2024, the DSPI, SMPPI, as well as the import and export price indices decreased by 1.3 per cent, 0.5 per cent, 3.9 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively.

The decrease in manufacturing UBC came on the back of a decrease in unit services costs (-2.7 per cent) and manufacturing ULC (-1.9 per cent), which more than offset an increase in unit non-labour production taxes (33.9 per cent). For 2024 as a whole, manufacturing UBC increased by 0.2 per cent, moderating from the 5.8 per cent increase in 2023. \n\nExhibit 3.4: Fixed Asset Investments by Industry Clusters in 2024 \n\nSingapore’s relative unit labour cost (RULC) for manufacturing – a measure of Singapore’s labour cost competitiveness against 16 economies 1– fell in 2024 (i.e., more competitive) as compared to 2023 (Exhibit 3.3). The decline was mainly on account of a decrease in Singapore’s manufacturing ULC relative to its competitor economies, which outweighed the stronger Singapore dollar. \n\n## INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS \n\nEDB attracted healthy levels of investment commitments in 2024. For the full year, FAI and TBE commitments came in at $13.5 billion and $8.4 billion respectively. In terms of FAI, the largest contribution came from the manufacturing sector, which garnered $11.1 billion in commitments. Within manufacturing, the electronics cluster attracted the largest amount of FAI commitments, at $7.7 billion, followed by the biomedical manufacturing cluster, at $2.2 billion. Within the services sector, the headquarters & professional services and research & development clusters contributed the most to total FAI commitments, amounting to $1.1 billion each (Exhibit 3.4). Investors from the United States were the largest source of FAI commitments, with $7.5 billion (55.5 per cent). They were followed by investors from Europe who contributed about $3.3 billion of FAI commitments (24.8 per cent). For TBE, the services sector attracted the highest amount of commitments, at $6.5 billion. This was driven by the headquarters & professional services cluster, which garnered $5.3 billion in TBE commitments, followed by the research & development cluster, with $818 million. Among the manufacturing clusters, the electronics cluster contributed the highest amount of TBE commitments, at $662 million (Exhibit 3.5).   \n\n> Biomedical Manufacturing 16.5% 17.6% Services Clusters 57.0% Electronics 8.9% Others\n> 1The 16 economies are Australia, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, CPI-All Items inflation came in at 0.2 per cent, edging down from the 0.3 per cent in the previous quarter. For 2024 as a whole, CPI-All Items inflation came in at 2.4 per cent, lower than the 4.8 per cent recorded in 2023. Price increases in the following CPI categories contributed positively to CPI-All Items inflation in 2024 (Exhibit 3.7). Healthcare costs climbed by 3.9 per cent on the back of more expensive outpatient and hospital services, as well as health insurance. Recreation & culture prices rose by 3.6 per cent due to increases in the costs of holiday travel and recreational & cultural services. Housing & utilities costs went up by 3.3 per cent as a result of higher accommodation costs. Education costs picked up by 3.2 per cent because of higher fees at commercial institutions, universities, childcare centres and kindergartens. Food prices increased by 2.8 per cent on account of the higher costs of food serving services such as hawker food and restaurant meals, as well as non-cooked food items such as bread & cereals and vegetables. Prices of miscellaneous goods & services increased by 1.4 per cent because of the higher prices of personal care items and alcoholic drinks & tobacco. Transport costs rose by 0.8 per cent as higher bus & train fares and more expensive point-to-point services and petrol more than offset lower car prices and airfares. Prices of household durables & services increased by 0.7 per cent on the back of more expensive domestic & household services. Communication costs edged up by 0.5 per cent due to the higher costs of telecommunication services. By contrast, clothing & footwear prices fell by 1.1 per cent ready-made garments and footwear became less expensive.

The declines during the quarter for DSPI and SMPPI came partly on the back of lower prices of mineral fuels and chemicals & chemical products. The import and export price indices fell in part due to cheaper mineral fuels and machinery & transport equipment. For the full year, the DSPI and SMPPI decreased by 1.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively, while the import and export price indices fell by 3.9 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively. The DSPI and SMPPI declined partly as a result of lower prices of mineral fuels and miscellaneous manufactured products. Meanwhile, the import and export price indices fell in part because of lower prices of machinery & transport equipment. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n26 BUSINESS COST CONDITIONS IN SINGAPORE’S MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES SECTORS \n\nIn 2024, unit business cost (UBC) in the manufacturing and services sectors rose. \n\nUBC for Manufacturing UBC for Services \n\n*Refers to the first three quarters of 2024 \n\n## 0.2% \n\nin 2024 5.8% \n\nin 2024* \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nThe increase in services UBC in 2024 came on the back of increases in both non-labour costs and unit labour cost. \n\nKEY DRIVERS \n\nFor 2025, the overall unit labour cost for the economy is likely to continue to rise at a pace that is broadly similar to that in 2024. Against the backdrop of rising global economic uncertainty, increases in remuneration per worker are likely to slow over the course of the year, even as productivity growth is expected to moderate in tandem with a slower pace of growth in the Singapore economy. At the same time, the costs of utilities, fuel and transportation are likely to moderate, in line with the outlook for global oil prices in 2025. \n\nOUTLOOK \n\nThe marginal increase in UBC for manufacturing in 2024 was due to the increase in the \"others\" cost component, which offset the declines in royalty payments, unit labour cost and the costs of work given out. \n\nCONTRIBUTION TO MANUFACTURING UBC IN 2024 CONTRIBUTION TO SERVICES UBC IN 2024 \n\nLabour Cost point +0.8% \n\nDEFINITION OF UBC \n\nTotal Business Cost Gross Real Value-Added UBC = Work Given Out point -0.2% Royalty Payments -0.6% point Others point +1.2% Labour Cost point -0.2% Non-Labour Cost +5.1% point Chapter 3: Costs, Investments and Prices \n\n27 \n\n# Box Article 3.1 -9 -6 -3 03691Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24 2023 2024 ULC Work Given Out Royalties Utilities Rental Others Unit Non-Labour Production Taxes Manufacturing UBC Contribution to YoY change, ppc \n\n## BOX 3.1: BUSINESS COST CONDITIONS IN SINGAPORE’S MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES SECTORS \n\nThis box article highlights the latest trends in business costs for firms in Singapore’s manufacturing and services sectors, as well as the outlook for key components of business costs in 2025. \n\n(I)  Unit Business Cost 1 in the Manufacturing and Services Sectors In 2024, unit business cost in the manufacturing and services sectors rose \n\nIn 2024, the unit business cost index for the manufacturing sector (UBCI) rose marginally by 0.2 per cent, easing from the 5.8 per cent increase in 2023 (Exhibit 1). The main contributor to the increase in UBCI in 2024 was the “others” cost component 2, which accounted for 1.2 percentage-points (pp) of the increase. This offset the declines in royalty payments 3, manufacturing unit labour cost (ULC) and the costs of work given out, which collectively contributed -1.0 pp to the UBCI increase. Meanwhile, the remaining cost components such as non-labour production taxes 4, utilities and rental costs 5 had a relatively small impact on the UBCI, in part due to their small shares in overall business costs. (Please refer to the Annex for the business cost structure of firms in the manufacturing and services sectors.) Source: Department of Statistics \n\nExhibit 1: Contribution to the UBCI Change by Key Cost Components \n\nAs for the overall services sector, its unit business cost index (UBC-Services Index) 6 rose by 5.8 per cent year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2024, a reversal from the 3.9 per cent year-on-year decline recorded for the same period in 2023 (Exhibit 2). 7 The pickup in the UBC-Services Index came on the back of increases in both non-labour costs (+5.1 pp contribution) and services ULC (+0.8 pp). In turn, the increase in non-labour costs was partly driven by higher sea freight rates compared to the first three quarters of 2023, which more than offset lower air freight rates over the same period. 1 Business costs tend to increase when firms produce a higher amount of output to meet demand. Unit business cost accounts for the change in output by measuring the business costs incurred to produce one unit of output. Only operating expenses (i.e., excluding materials costs and depreciation) are included in business costs based on the definition adopted by the Department of Statistics (DOS) in its computation of the Unit Business Cost for Manufacturing. See DOS’s Information Paper, “Methodological Review on the Unit Business Cost Index for Manufacturing Industry (Base Year 2010=100)”, at https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/ publications/economy/ip-e38.pdf. 2 “Others” costs include professional fees, advertising, commission & agency fees, sundry expenses etc. 3 Royalty payments refer to payments to another party (the licensor or franchisor who owns a particular asset) for the right to the ongoing use of that asset. There could be many reasons for changes in royalty payments. For instance, royalty payments vary with company-specific licensing agreements which could differ from year to year. Furthermore, royalties are usually computed as a percentage of sales, which could be volatile each year. 4 Non-labour production taxes include property, road and other indirect taxes. Labour-related taxes on production (e.g., foreign worker levy) are classified under labour cost. Taxes on income (e.g., corporate income tax) are not included in business costs. 5 Industrial rentals rose by 3.5 per cent in 2024, moderating from the 8.9 per cent increase in 2023. 6 The UBC-Services Index assesses cost conditions in the services sector. It is a composite index of proxy cost indicators for each component of business costs, combined using weights estimated from expenditure data in DOS’ Services Survey Series 2019, as well as the 2019 Input-Output tables. 7 The latest available UBC-Services Index is up to the third quarter of 2024. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n28 -8 -6 -4 -2 0246810 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 2023 2024 ULC Non-labour Cost UBC - Services Index \n\nContribution to YoY change, ppc \n\nExhibit 2: Contribution to UBC-Services Index Changes by Cost Components (II)  Latest Trends and Outlook for Key Cost Components Following a moderation in its pace of increase in 2024, the ULC for the overall economy is expected to rise at a broadly similar pace in 2025 \n\nThe ULC for the overall economy rose by 1.2 per cent in 2024, moderating from the 6.5 per cent increase in 2023 largely because of a pickup in productivity growth in 2024. 8,9 The increase in the overall ULC in 2024 was due to a rise in total labour cost 10 (TLC) per worker (4.0 per cent) which outstripped the increase in labour productivity 11 (2.7 per cent) (Exhibit 3). In turn, the increase in TLC per worker was mainly driven by higher remuneration per worker (+3.3 pp contribution). At the broad sectoral level, the ULC of the services producing industries (1.5 per cent) and construction sector (1.6 per cent) both increased in 2024 due to a rise in TLC per worker that outweighed labour productivity growth within the sector (Exhibit 4). By contrast, the manufacturing sector (-0.8 per cent) recorded a fall in ULC as labour productivity gains more than offset an increase in TLC per worker. Meanwhile, within the services producing industries, the food & beverage services (10.2 per cent), retail trade (6.2 per cent) and administrative & support services (6.2 per cent) sectors registered the largest ULC increases. For these three sectors, the increase in their ULCs was due to the combined effects of an increase in TLC per worker and a fall in labour productivity. For 2025, the ULC for the overall economy is likely to continue to rise at a pace that is broadly similar to that in 2024. Against the backdrop of rising global economic uncertainty, increases in remuneration per worker are likely to slow over the course of the year as employers turn more cautious and tightness in the labour market continues to ease. This will be broadly offset by an expected moderation in productivity growth in tandem with a slower pace of growth in the Singapore economy. Source: MTI Staff estimates Notes: (1) The 2023 and 2024 figures refer to the average of the UBC-Services Index for the first three quarters of the respective years; (2) Detailed cost component breakdown of the UBC-Services Index is not available; (3) Non-labour costs include air & sea freight costs, cargo handling costs and warehousing & storage costs. 8 A change in the ULC can be approximately decomposed as the change in total labour cost per worker minus the change in labour productivity (proxied by gross real value-added per worker). The approximation holds better when the changes are small. 9 In 2024, labour productivity growth came in at 2.7 per cent, a reversal from the 2.8 per cent decline in 2023. 10  TLC comprises remuneration, wage subsidies and other labour-related costs, which include the skills development levy, foreign worker levy, and recruitment and net training costs. 11  Labour productivity in this decomposition is proxied by real gross value-added per worker.

This is a common market practice in Asia. 14 EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook Report, February 2025. 15 As announced earlier by MSE, to meet the higher costs of supplying and producing water, the potable water price will increase by 50 cents per cubic metre in two phases over 2024 and 2025. This represents an increase in the water price of about 2.5 per cent per year since the last round of price revision in 2018.\n\nCosts of utilities, fuel and transportation are likely to moderate in 2025 \n\nThe cost of utilities borne by firms is closely linked to electricity costs, 12 which are in turn influenced by global oil prices. 13 Oil prices also contribute to business costs through fuel and transportation costs. In 2024, the average wholesale electricity price declined by 35 per cent (i.e., from $251/MWh in 2023 to $163/MWh in 2024), in part reflecting the moderation in global oil prices in the second half of 2024 (Exhibit 5). Global oil prices are projected to ease further in 2025 as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and selected non-member countries (i.e., OPEC+) gradually unwind their oil production cuts over the course of the year and global oil demand moderates. For 2025 as a whole, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has projected that global oil prices will average US$74 per barrel (/bbl) 14 , lower than the 2024 average of US$81/bbl. Correspondingly, domestic fuel and transportation costs are expected to moderate in 2025. Similarly, the domestic cost of utilities is expected to ease, notwithstanding the phased increase in water price 15 in 2025. \n\n10.2 6.2 6.2 4.4 3.8 3.6 3.2 1.6 1.5 0.7 0.4 -0.8 -2.0 -3.0 Food & Beverage Services Retail Trade Administrative & Support Services Other Services Industries Professional Services Real Estate Accommodation Construction Services Producing Industries Wholesale Trade Finance & Insurance Manufacturing Information & Communications Transportation & Storage Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n30 Exhibit 5: Global Oil Prices and Uniform Singapore Energy Prices (USEP), 1Q24 – 4Q24 Conclusion \n\nIn 2024, the UBCI for the manufacturing sector rose marginally as an increase in the “others” cost component outweighed the declines in royalty payments, manufacturing ULC and the costs of work given out. Meanwhile, the UBC-Services Index increased in the first three quarters of 2024 on account of an increase in non-labour costs and services ULC. For 2025, the overall ULC for the economy is likely to continue to rise at a pace that is broadly similar to that in 2024. Against the backdrop of rising global economic uncertainty, increases in remuneration per worker are likely to slow over the course of the year, even as productivity growth is expected to moderate in tandem with a slower pace of growth in the Singapore economy. At the same time, the costs of utilities, fuel and transportation are likely to moderate, in line with the outlook for global oil prices in 2025.

These three components collectively accounted for around 84 per cent of the business costs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and around 78 per cent of the business costs of non-SMEs in the sector in 2023. The remaining cost components, including utilities, fuel, rental of building/premises and charges paid to other firms for inland transportation and ocean/air/other freight, made up a smaller share of business costs, at around 16 per cent for SMEs and 22 per cent for non-SMEs in 2023. Non-labour production taxes, which include property, road and other indirect taxes, accounted for around 0.5 per cent of the business costs of both SMEs and non-SMEs over the same period. Details of the business cost structure of SMEs and non-SMEs in the various manufacturing clusters are in Exhibit A1. \n\nServices Sectors \n\nLabour cost constituted a major cost component for firms in the services sectors, with its share of business costs ranging from around 4 per cent on average for SMEs in the transportation & storage sector, to around 36 per cent or more for SMEs in labour-intensive sectors such as food & beverage services, accommodation and retail trade in 2023. On the other hand, utilities cost was a relatively small cost component for services firms, accounting for less than 2 per cent of the business costs of SMEs in most services sectors in 2023. Key exceptions were the accommodation and food & beverage services sectors, where utilities cost constituted 8 per cent and 6 per cent of the business costs of SMEs in these sectors respectively. Similarly, rental cost accounted for a small share of the business costs of SMEs in most services sectors. Key exceptions were the retail trade and food & beverage services sectors, where rental costs constituted around 23 per cent and 21 per cent of the business costs of SMEs in these sectors respectively. Similar to the manufacturing sector, non-labour production taxes accounted for less than 1 per cent of the business costs of firms in most services sectors. Details of the business cost structure of SMEs and non-SMEs in the various services sectors are in Exhibit A2.

The increase was due to the growth in re-exports, which outweighed the decline in domestic exports. Domestic exports fell by 6.0 per cent, a pullback from the 5.4 per cent growth in the third quarter. Meanwhile, re-exports expanded by 13.9 per cent, accelerating from the 5.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2024, total merchandise exports expanded by 5.7 per cent, a reversal from the 10.1 per cent contraction in 2023. \n\nNon-Oil Domestic Exports \n\nNon-oil domestic exports (NODX) grew by 2.4 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, easing from the 9.0 per cent growth in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 4.2). The increase in NODX was due to the growth in electronics NODX, even as non-electronics NODX fell. \n\nExhibit 4.2: Changes in Domestic Exports \n\n> Per Cent -10 -5 0510\n> IV III II IIV\n> 2024 2023 Domestic Exports Non-Oil Domestic Exports\n\nExhibit 4.1: Growth Rates of Total Merchandise Trade, Merchandise Exports and Merchandise Imports (In Nominal Terms) 2023 2024 2024 I II III IV Total Merchandise Trade -11.7 4.6 9.9 5.3 6.8 6.6 Merchandise Exports -10.1 4.4 7.5 5.7 5.1 5.7 Domestic Exports -13.5 0.3 2.9 5.4 -6.0 0.5 Oil -14.2 6.0 19.0 -0.2 -17.9 1.0 Non-Oil -13.1 -3.4 -6.5 9.0 2.4 0.2 Re-Exports -7.1 7.8 11.5 5.9 13.9 9.8 Merchandise Imports -13.4 5.0 12.5 5.0 8.7 7.8 Oil -19.0 2.1 16.0 -7.7 -9.5 -0.3 Non-oil -11.9 5.7 11.7 8.3 13.7 9.9 OVERVIEW \n\nSingapore’s total merchandise trade increased by 6.8 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, faster than the 5.3 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. At the same time, total services trade increased by 7.4 per cent year-on-year, moderating from the 10.8 per cent growth in the third quarter. For the whole of 2024, Singapore’s total merchandise trade expanded by 6.6 per cent to S$1.3 trillion, compared to the S$1.2 trillion in 2023. Oil trade declined by 0.1 per cent amidst lower oil prices compared to a year ago, while non-oil trade increased by 8.3 per cent. Merchandise exports and imports increased by 5.7 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. Total services trade grew by 8.6 per cent to $998 billion in 2024, up from $919 billion in 2023. Services exports and imports increased by 9.9 per cent and 7.1 per cent respectively in 2024.

The growth in electronic NODX was primarily due to an increase in the domestic exports of ICs, disk media products and PCs. Non-electronics NODX declined by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, a reversal from the 7.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter. The decline in non-electronics NODX was primarily due to lower domestic exports of pharmaceuticals, specialised machinery and petrochemicals. For the full year, NODX grew by 0.2 per cent, a reversal from the 13.1 per cent contraction in 2023. The growth in NODX was due to increased shipments of electronics (+8.2 per cent), which outweighed the decline in non-electronics (-1.9 per cent). The top 10 NODX markets accounted for 80.0 per cent of Singapore’s total NODX in 2024. Singapore’s NODX to most markets increased even as NODX to the EU 27 (-21.4 per cent), Japan (-17.6 per cent) and the US (-6.6 per cent) declined. NODX to EU 27 contracted mainly because of a decline in the exports of pharmaceuticals, telecommunications equipment and specialised machinery. NODX to the US fell on the back of a decline in the exports of pharmaceuticals, structures of ships & boats and telecommunications equipment. Meanwhile, pharmaceuticals, miscellaneous manufactured articles and measuring instruments contributed the most to the decline in NODX to Japan. On the other hand, NODX to Malaysia grew due to higher exports of ICs, other computer peripherals and non-monetary gold. \n\nOil Domestic Exports \n\nOil domestic exports contracted by 17.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 0.2 per cent decline in the previous quarter. The decline in oil domestic exports was led by lower exports to economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia. The decrease also partly reflected lower oil prices compared to the same quarter a year ago. In volume terms, oil domestic exports declined by 5.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, a reversal from the 15.9 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. For the full year, oil domestic exports rose by 1.0 per cent year-on-year, a turnaround from the 14.2 per cent contraction in 2023. By economies, it was driven mainly by higher exports to Indonesia, China and Liberia. In volume terms, oil domestic exports increased by 5.7 per cent in 2024, picking up from the 2.2 per cent growth in 2023. \n\nNon-Oil Re-Exports \n\nNon-oil re-exports (NORX) expanded by 14.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the 6.5 per cent growth in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 4.4). The growth in NORX could be attributed to an increase in both electronics and non-electronics NORX. Electronics NORX rose by 16.4 per cent, extending the 12.3 per cent increase in the third quarter, as the re-exports of ICs, PCs and parts of PCs grew. Meanwhile, non-electronics NORX rose by 11.8 per cent, faster than the 0.1 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. The growth in non-electronics NORX was mainly driven by higher re-exports of non-monetary gold, non-electric engines & motors and specialised machinery.

The growth in NORX was due to an increase in both electronics NORX (+16.2 per cent) and non-electronics NORX (+3.8 per cent). NORX to the top 10 NORX markets as a whole grew in 2024 (Exhibit 4.5). NORX to Malaysia expanded on the back of an increase in the re-exports of PCs, other computer peripherals and parts of PCs. Meanwhile, higher shipments of ICs, PCs and telecommunications equipment led to an increase in NORX to Hong Kong. Re-exports to Thailand rose on account of an increase in the shipments of ICs, consumer electronics and parts of PCs. \n\nMerchandise Imports \n\nNon-oil imports expanded by 13.7 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, following the 8.3 per cent growth in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 4.6). The growth in non-oil imports was due to an increase in both electronics (+28.8 per cent) and non-electronics imports (+4.3 per cent). In turn, the growth in electronics imports was due to an increase in the imports of ICs, PCs and other computer peripherals. Meanwhile, the growth in non-electronics imports was due to the imports of non-electric engines & motors, non-monetary gold and specialised machinery. Oil imports declined by 9.5 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 7.7 per cent decline in the preceding quarter. The decrease in oil imports was due partly to lower oil prices. In volume terms, oil imports increased by 1.1 per cent, improving from the 3.8 per cent decline in the third quarter. For the full year of 2024, non-oil imports rose by 9.9 per cent, a turnaround from the 11.9 per cent contraction in 2023. Meanwhile, oil imports declined by 0.3 per cent, easing from the 19.0 per cent contraction in 2023.

The growth in services exports was primarily driven by the exports of transport services and financial services, which grew by 14.6 per cent and 13.7 per cent respectively. For the full year, services exports expanded by 9.9 per cent, picking up from the 2.7 per cent increase in 2023. The increase in services exports was attributable mainly to the exports of transport services, other business services and financial services, which grew by 15.7 per cent, 5.7 per cent and 9.6 per cent respectively. \n\nServices Imports \n\nServices imports expanded by 6.4 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, easing from the 9.5 per cent growth in the previous quarter. The growth in services imports was led by the imports of transport services, other business services and travel services, which expanded by 7.4 per cent, 4.0 per cent and 13.8 per cent respectively. For the whole of 2024, services imports expanded by 7.1 per cent, the same rate of growth as in 2023. The growth in services imports was mainly due to the imports of transport services and travel services, which grew by 8.3 per cent and 20.2 per cent respectively.

For 2024 as a whole, the current account surplus rose by $8.3 billion to $128 billion (17.5 per cent of GDP). The increase was driven by a larger services account surplus and a narrowing of the primary income deficit, which more than offset a smaller goods account surplus and a larger secondary income deficit. In terms of the components of the current account, the goods surplus came in at $48.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, edging up from $48.2 billion in the third quarter, as exports rose more than imports (Exhibit 5.2). For 2024 as a whole, the goods surplus stood at $198 billion, lower than the $211 billion in 2023, as imports increased more than exports. The surplus in the services balance fell to $15.1 billion in the fourth quarter, from $17.4 billion in the preceding quarter. For the whole of 2024, the surplus in the services balance increased to $59.4 billion, from $42.9 billion in 2023. This was mainly driven by a rise in net receipts for transport services, financial services, and other business services. These more than offset the rise in net payments for travel services. The primary income deficit widened by $4.0 billion from the previous quarter to $32.5 billion in the fourth quarter. For the year as a whole, the deficit narrowed by $5.9 billion to $119 billion, as receipts rose more than payments. \n\nExhibit 5.2: Components of Current Account Balance Exhibit 5.1: Current Account Balance   \n\n> $ Billion 2023 2024 25 30 35\n> IV III II IIV\n> $ Billion 2023 2024 -40 -20 020 40 60\n> IV III II IIV\n> Goods Balance Services Balance Primary Income Balance Secondary Income Balance\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nSingapore’s overall balance of payments recorded a deficit of $11.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, a reversal from the surplus of $17.3 billion in the third quarter. For the whole of 2024, the overall balance of payments registered a surplus of $39.7 billion, lower than the surplus of $81.8 billion in 2023. The smaller surplus was mainly due to an increase in net outflows from the capital and financial account. Singapore’s official foreign reserves rose to $507 billion at the end of 2024.

For more details regarding the change in sign convention to the financial account, please refer to DOS’s information paper on “Singapore’s International Accounts: Methodological Updates and Recent Developments”.\n\n## CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNT \n\nThe capital and financial account 1 registered a larger net outflow of $39.1 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to $17.1 billion in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 5.3). For 2024 as a whole, net outflows amounted to $88.1 billion (12.0 per cent of GDP), up from the $39.4 billion in 2023. The increase was due mainly to higher net outflows of “other investment”, and financial derivatives switching to net outflows from net inflows in the preceding year. These more than offset the rise in net inflows of direct investment and a decline in net outflows of portfolio investment. In terms of the components of the capital and financial account, net outflows of “other investment” came in at $62.9 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $29.9 billion in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 5.4). For the full year, net outflows of “other investment” rose to $110 billion, an increase from the $35.4 billion registered in 2023. This was in part due to higher net outflows from resident deposit-taking corporations as well as the resident non-bank private sector. At the same time, net inflows of direct investment reached $38.9 billion in the fourth quarter, higher than the $30.1 billion in the previous quarter. For 2024 as a whole, net inflows of direct investment rose by $3.6 billion to $129 billion, as the increase in foreign direct investment flows into Singapore exceeded that of residents’ direct investments abroad. Financial derivatives switched to net outflows of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, from net inflows of $3.0 billion in the preceding quarter. For 2024 as a whole, financial derivatives reversed to net outflows of $2.4 billion, from net inflows of $1.9 billion in 2023. Net outflows of portfolio investment fell to $13.4 billion in the fourth quarter, from $20.3 billion in the previous quarter. For the full year, net outflows of portfolio investment fell by $26.4 billion to $105 billion in 2024. The decline in net outflows was attributable to resident deposit-taking corporations, as well as the resident non-bank private sector which switched to net inflows in 2024 from net outflows in the previous year.

For the whole of 2024, the manufacturing sector grew by 4.3 per cent, reversing the 4.2 per cent decline in 2023. Growth in the sector was supported by output expansions across all clusters except the biomedical manufacturing cluster (Exhibit 6.2). \n\n## PERFORMANCE OF CLUSTERS \n\nThe electronics cluster grew by 15.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, supported by output expansions in all segments except for the other electronic modules & components segment. Output of the infocomms & consumer electronics, computer peripherals & data storage and semiconductors segments grew by 26.2 per cent, 24.1 per cent and 15.0 per cent respectively, on the back of improved demand. By contrast, output of the other electronic modules & components segment declined by 2.0 per cent. For the whole of 2024, the electronics cluster expanded by 8.4 per cent. \n\nExhibit 6.1: Manufacturing Growth Rates  \n\n> Per Cent 2023 2024 -5 0510 15\n> IV III II IIV\n> 1.8 7.4 11.2 -0.6 -1.1\n\nExhibit 6.2: Manufacturing Clusters’ Growth     \n\n> Per Cent 2024 2023 -20 -10 010 20\n> Biomedical General Manufacturing Precision Engineering Chemicals Electronics Transport Engineering Total Manufacturing Industries Manufacturing\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe manufacturing sector expanded by 7.4 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, moderating from the 11.2 per cent increase in the preceding quarter. Growth was largely led by the electronics and transport engineering clusters. For the whole of 2024, the manufacturing sector grew by 4.3 per cent, reversing the 4.2 per cent decline in 2023. All clusters recorded output expansions except for the biomedical manufacturing cluster. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n56 \n\n# Chapter 6.1 Output in the transport engineering cluster increased by 8.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, led by the 15.8 per cent growth in the aerospace segment on account of a higher level of demand for aircraft parts and an increase in maintenance, repair and overhaul jobs from commercial airlines. The land and marine & offshore engineering segments grew by 5.6 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. For the full year, the transport engineering cluster expanded by 9.4 per cent. The general manufacturing cluster grew by 0.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, supported by higher production in the food, beverages & tobacco segment. The food, beverages & tobacco segment grew 3.6 per cent on account of a higher production of milk powder, cocoa products and animal feed additives. On the other hand, output of the printing and miscellaneous industries segments declined by 1.0 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively, with the latter recording a lower production of structural metal products and paperboard containers and boxes. For the whole of 2024, the general manufacturing cluster expanded by 1.3 per cent. The chemicals cluster contracted by 0.1 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, driven by an output contraction in the specialties segment. Output in the specialties segment declined by 26.2 per cent on account of a lower level of production of mineral oil additives and biofuels. By contrast, output of the other chemicals segment grew 7.6 per cent with a higher level of output of fragrances. The petroleum and petrochemicals segments grew 6.1 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively, with the former growing from a low base the previous year due to plant maintenance shutdowns. For the whole of 2024, output of the chemicals cluster rose by 4.3 per cent. Output in the precision engineering cluster declined by 3.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter. The machinery and systems segment contracted by 5.7 per cent due to a lower production of semiconductor-related equipment. By contrast, the precision modules & components segment grew by 1.8 per cent on account of a higher output of optical instruments, plastic precision components and electronic connectors. For 2024 as a whole, output in the precision engineering cluster grew by 2.3 per cent. The biomedical manufacturing cluster contracted by 4.4 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, driven by an output contraction in the pharmaceuticals segment. The pharmaceuticals segment declined by 10.7 per cent on account of a lower level of production of biological products and a different mix of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) being produced. On the other hand, output in the medical technology segment expanded by 4.6 per cent, supported by continued export demand for medical devices. For the whole of 2024, the biomedical manufacturing cluster declined by 12.5 per cent. Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance \n\n57 CONSTRUCTION Exhibit 6.4: Contracts Awarded, 2024 ($ Billion) Exhibit 6.3: Contracts Awarded \n\n## CONSTRUCTION DEMAND \n\nConstruction demand (contracts awarded) dropped by 4.6 per cent year-on-year to $9.8 billion in the fourth quarter. The contraction in public construction demand weighed down the expansion in private sector construction demand (Exhibit 6.3). \n\nPublic Sector \n\nIn the fourth quarter, public sector construction demand contracted by 34.1 per cent year-on-year to $4.5 billion. Residential and civil engineering construction demand declined by 68.3 per cent and 56.6 per cent respectively. On the other hand, construction demand for the rest of the building types expanded, ranging from 74.5 per cent for institutional building projects to 921 per cent for commercial building projects. \n\nTotal Public Private Total 44.2 24.6 19.7 \n\nResidential 15.3 7.3 8.0 \n\nCommercial 5.4 0.3 5.1 \n\nIndustrial 4.9 0.3 4.6 \n\nInstitutional & Others 11.6 10.4 1.2 \n\nCivil Engineering Works 7.0 6.3 0.8 For the full year, total construction demand expanded by 29.5 per cent to $44.2 billion (Exhibit 6.4), due to increases of 27.2 per cent in public sector construction demand and 32.5 per cent in private sector construction demand.  \n\n> 0510 15\n> IV III II IIV\n> $ Billion 2023 2024 Total Private Public\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe construction sector grew by 4.4 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, slower than the 5.6 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2024, the sector expanded by 4.5 per cent, slower than the 5.8 per cent growth in 2023. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n58 \n\n# Chapter 6.2 Exhibit 6.5: Certified Payments For the full year, public sector construction demand increased by 27.2 per cent to $24.6 billion (Exhibit 6.4). The expansion was supported by an increase in contracts awarded for public commercial buildings (284 per cent) and public institutional and other buildings (117 per cent), Some of the major projects awarded during the year include (i) MPA’s office building at Cantonment Road; (ii) foundation works for MOH’s Eastern Integrated Health Campus and the redevelopment of Alexandra Hospital; (iii) NHB’s Founders’ Memorial; (iv) MOH’s Health Sciences Authority Building; (v) SCB’s New Science Centre; (vi) PA’s Bukit Timah Integrated Development; and (vii) various contracts under LTA’s Cross Island MRT Line (Phase 2). \n\nPrivate Sector \n\nIn the fourth quarter, private sector construction demand increased by 54.6 per cent year-on-year to $5.3 billion. Except for commercial building and civil engineering projects, which registered contractions of 10.0 per cent and 89.8 per cent respectively, demand expanded for all other types of projects, ranging from 7.7 per cent for institutional building projects to 152 per cent for residential building projects. For the full year, private sector construction demand grew by 32.5 per cent to $19.7 billion, on the back of higher demand for all building developments, including private residential (43.8 per cent), commercial (44.5 per cent), industrial (9.2 per cent) and institutional and other building (74.4 per cent) projects (Exhibit 6.4). Major projects awarded in 2024 include (i) development of various past en-bloc sales and GLS sites; (ii) Resorts World at Sentosa 2.0; (iii) Singtel’s Comcentre redevelopment; (iv) VisionPower’s semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility at Tampines; (v) PSA Supply Chain Hub@Tuas; (vi) YTL Powerseraya’s Combined Cycle Power Plant and (vii) Perennial Holdings’ Geriatric Care Home at Parry Avenue. \n\n## CONSTRUCTION OUTPUT \n\nConstruction output (or nominal certified payments) rose by 8.4 per cent year-on-year to $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter, supported by expansions in both public and private sector construction output (Exhibit 6.5). For the full year, construction output increased by 10.0 per cent to $38.4 billion, extending the 15.4 per cent growth in 2023. \n\nPublic Sector \n\nPublic sector construction output rose by 16.1 per cent year-on-year to $5.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Construction output for all development types increased, supported by residential building (15.9 per cent), commercial building (25.6 per cent), industrial building (12.5 per cent), institutional and other building (10.8 per cent) and civil engineering (19.4 per cent) projects. For the full year, public sector construction output increased by 19.1 per cent to $20.6 billion, underpinned by expansion in outputs of all development types including residential building (20.0 per cent), commercial building (15.4 per cent), industrial building (44.4 per cent), institutional and other building (10.1 per cent) and civil engineering (19.5 per cent) works. Apart from public housing projects, other major projects supporting the growth included (i) MHA’s extension of the ICA Building; (ii) JTC’s Punggol Digital District, Space@AMK and Bulim Square; (iii) NEA’s Integrated Waste Management Facility; (iv) MOH’s SGH Elective Care Centre/National Dental Centre; (v) LTA’s Singapore Rail Test Centre; (vi) Sport Singapore’s Punggol Regional Sports Centre; (vii) SIT Campus@Punggol North (Plot 1); and (viii) LTA’s Cross Island MRT Line, Jurong Region MRT Line, East Coast Integrated Depot and North South Corridor.  \n\n> 0246810 12\n> IV III II IIV\n> $ Billion 2023 2024 Total Private Public Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance\n\n59 Private Sector \n\nIn the fourth quarter, private sector construction output increased slightly by 0.7 per cent year-on-year to $4.8 billion. The growth in residential building (5.2 per cent), institutional and other building (21.6 per cent) and civil engineering (20.2 per cent) works was weighed down by the contractions in commercial (-2.0 per cent) and industrial (-7.4 per cent) building works. For the full year, private sector construction output grew by 1.2 per cent to $17.9 billion. The expansions in construction output for residential building (2.4 per cent), institutional and other building (4.9 per cent) and civil engineering (28.1 per cent) works were weighed down by the declines in commercial (-3.1 per cent) and industrial (-2.8 per cent) building works. Major ongoing projects include (i) various condominiums from past en-bloc sales sites and GLS sites; (ii) mixed-used integrated developments; (iii) RWS’ Singapore Oceanarium; (iv) Mandai Park Development’s Rainforest Park North and East Arrival Node; and (v) SP Powerassets’ power cabling and installation works. \n\n## CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS \n\nIn tandem with the rise in construction output, total consumption of ready-mixed concrete increased by 9.1 per cent in 2024 to 13.4 million m 3. Similarly, total consumption of steel rebars 1 rose by 3.9 per cent to about 1.6 million tonnes in 2024. The average market price of Grade 40 pump ready-mixed concrete 2 increased by 4.0 per cent to about $120.37 per m 3 in the fourth quarter of 2024, due to stronger local demand for ready-mixed concrete. On the other hand, the average market price of steel rebars 3 fell by 9.4 per cent to around $746.87 per tonne in the fourth quarter, due to softening of global steel demand (Exhibit 6.6). \n\n## CONSTRUCTION COSTS \n\nBCA’s Building Works Tender Price Index (TPI) remained relatively stable and is estimated to have increased by 1 per cent to 2 per cent year-on-year in 2024 (Exhibit 6.7). Looking ahead, domestic construction tender prices are likely to be supported by strong demand for construction works over the medium-term. \n\nExhibit 6.7: Changes in Tender Price Index    \n\n> 1Rebar consumption is estimated from net imports plus local production (without factoring in stock levels). 2The market prices are based on contracts with non-fixed price and market retail price. 3The market prices refer to 16mm to 32mm High Tensile rebars and are based on fixed price supply contracts with a contract period of 6 months or below.\n\nExhibit 6.6: Changes in Market Prices of Construction Materials  \n\n> Per Cent\n> 2023 2024 -20 -10 010\n> IV III II IIV\n> Ready-Mixed Concrete Steel Bars\n> Per Cent 0510 15\n> 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Economic Survey of Singapore 2024\n\n60 CONSTRUCTION OUTLOOK IN 2025 \n\nAccording to BCA, total construction demand is projected to be between $47.0 billion and $53.0 billion in 2025 (Exhibit 6.8). The strong construction demand in 2025 is mainly due to the expected awards of large-scale projects such as expansion of Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort (MBS IR2) and development of Changi Airport Terminal 5 (T5). Taking into account contracts awarded in recent years and the construction demand forecast for 2025, total nominal construction output is projected to be between $39 billion and $42 billion in 2025, higher than the preliminary estimate of about $38.4 billion in 2024. This growth is expected to be bolstered by strong construction demand over the past few years and a projected increase in demand in 2025. \n\nExhibit 6.8: Projected Construction Demand in 2025 $ Billion TOTAL CONSTRUCTION DEMAND 47.0 - 53.0 Building Construction Sub-total 38.1 - 43.0 Residential 13.8 - 15.2 \n\nCommercial 3.6 - 5.1 \n\nIndustrial 5.1 - 5.6 \n\nInstitutional & Others 15.6 - 17.0 \n\nCivil Engineering Works Sub-total 9.0 - 10.0 Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance \n\n61 WHOLESALE TRADE \n\n## WHOLESALE SALES \n\nIn the fourth quarter, the wholesale trade sector was supported by an increase in both foreign and domestic wholesale sales volumes. Specifically, foreign wholesale sales volume rose by 6.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, easing from the 10.2 per cent increase in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 6.9). Growth in sales volume was fastest in the household equipment & furniture (23.1 per cent), general wholesale trade (19.0 per cent), and food, beverages & tobacco (16.5 per cent) segments, which outpaced the decline in the sales volume of the industrial & construction machinery (-10.8 per cent), transport equipment (-0.9 per cent) and metals, timber & construction materials (-0.1 per cent). For the whole of 2024, the foreign wholesale trade index rose by 7.6 per cent, a marked acceleration from the 1.0 per cent growth in the previous year. Meanwhile, domestic wholesale sales volume expanded by 2.5 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, a reversal from the 4.3 per cent decline in the preceding quarter. Growth in sales volume was the strongest in the metals, timber & construction materials (32.1 per cent), transport equipment (20.2 per cent) and general wholesale trade (20.1 per cent) segments, offsetting the contraction in the sales volume of industrial & construction machinery (-22.3 per cent) and electronic components (-11.0 per cent). For the whole of 2024, the domestic wholesale trade index contracted by 1.5 per cent, extending the 1.1 per cent decline posted in 2023. \n\nExhibit 6.9: Changes in Wholesale Trade Index in Chained Volume Terms  \n\n> Per Cent 2023 2024 -10 -5 0510 15\n> IV III II IIV\n> Foreign Wholesale Trade Index Domestic Wholesale Trade Index\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe wholesale trade sector expanded by 6.7 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 6.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter. Growth during the quarter was largely supported by the machinery, equipment & supplies segment on the back of the wholesale sales of electronic components and telecommunications & computers. At the same time, the fuels & chemicals segment grew due to an increase in the wholesale volume of petroleum & petroleum products and chemicals & chemical products. For the whole of 2024, the sector grew by 5.1 per cent, picking up from the 0.9 per cent expansion in 2023. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n62 \n\n# Chapter 6.3 RETAIL TRADE \n\nFor the full year, overall retail sales volume decreased by 0.2 per cent, reversing from the 0.4 per cent expansion in 2023. In 2024, non-motor vehicle sales volume shrank by 2.2 per cent. The decline in non-motor vehicle sales was led by the sales of computer & telecommunications equipment (-8.8 per cent), watches & jewellery (-6.7 per cent) and wearing apparel & footwear (-4.1 per cent). On the other hand, the sales volumes of food & alcohol (7.1 per cent), cosmetics, toiletries & medical goods (1.6 per cent) and supermarkets & hypermarkets (1.1 per cent) grew. Meanwhile, motor vehicle sales volume grew by 15.1 per cent due to an increase in COE quotas (Exhibit 6.11). \n\n## RETAIL SALES \n\nOverall retail sales volume decreased by 1.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 0.3 per cent decline in the third quarter (Exhibit 6.10). Overall retail sales were weighed down by the decrease in non-motor vehicle sales volume (-3.1 per cent). This was led by declines in the sales volumes of computer & telecommunications equipment (-14.1 per cent), watches & jewellery (-11.6 per cent), and optical goods & books (-4.6 per cent). On the other hand, the recreational goods (3.7 per cent), cosmetics, toiletries & medical goods (2.9 per cent) and supermarkets & hypermarkets (1.6 per cent) segments grew. Meanwhile, motor vehicle sales volume grew by 13.9 per cent due to an increase in COE quotas. \n\nExhibit 6.10: Changes in Retail Sales Index in Chained Volume Terms \n\n> Per Cent\n\n2023 2024 -6 -4 -2 024\n\nIV III II IIV \n\n> Total Total (excluding Motor Vehicles)\n\nExhibit 6.11: Changes in Retail Sales Index in Chained Volume Terms for Major Segments in 2024        \n\n> -15 -10 -5 0510 15 20\n> Computer & Telecomms Equipment Watches & Jewellery Optical Goods & Books Mini-marts & Convenience Stores Wearing Apparel & Footwear Petrol Service Stations Department Stores Recreational Goods Furniture & Household Equipment Others Supermarkets & Hypermarkets Cosmetics, Toiletries & Medical Goods Food & Alcohol Motor Vehicles\n> Per Cent 15.1 7.1 1.6 1.1 0.4 -0.2 -0.7 -3.2 -3.8 -4.1 -6.0 -6.2 -6.7 -8.8\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe retail trade sector contracted by 1.0 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 0.7 per cent decline in the previous quarter.

For the full year, the number of TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units) handled by Singapore’s ports came in at 41.1 million, representing a 5.4 per cent expansion, accelerating from the 4.6 per cent growth clocked in 2023. \n\n## AIR TRANSPORT \n\nTotal air passenger traffic (less transit) handled by Changi Airport climbed by 10.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 10.1 per cent growth in the previous quarter (Exhibit 6.13). In absolute terms, air passenger traffic volume recovered to 100 per cent of the volume seen in the fourth quarter of 2019 (pre-pandemic). For the full year, total air passenger traffic passing through Changi Airport climbed by 14.8 per cent to come in at 67.1 million, moderating from the 83.1 per cent increase posted in 2023. Overall sea cargo volume expanded by 1.3 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, moderating from the 3.2 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. The expansion in sea cargo volume was led by growth in general cargo shipments, which expanded by 1.1 per cent during the quarter, easing from the 5.8 per cent growth registered in the third quarter. For the whole of 2024, overall sea cargo volume grew by 5.2 per cent, improving from the 2.4 per cent increase in the previous year. \n\nExhibit 6.12: Changes in Container Throughput and Sea Cargo Handled \n\n> Per Cent\n\n0510 15 \n\nIV III II IIV \n\n> Sea Cargo Container Throughput\n\n2023 2024 \n\nExhibit 6.13: Changes in Air Transport \n\n> Per Cent\n\n-10 010 20 30 40 \n\nIV III II IIV \n\n2023 2024 \n\n> Air Passengers Air Cargo Aircraft Landings\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe transportation & storage sector expanded by 3.7 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, moderating from the 7.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2024, the sector grew at a faster pace of 5.8 per cent compared to the 3.5 per cent expansion recorded in 2023. The expansion of the sector was supported largely by the water transport, air transport and storage & other support services segments. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n64 \n\n# Chapter 6.5 Meanwhile, air cargo volume grew by 15.0 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, following the 13.5 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. In absolute terms, total air cargo volume was at 99.9 per cent of pre-pandemic levels (i.e., in the fourth quarter of 2019). For 2024 as a whole, air cargo shipments grew by 14.6 per cent, reversing the 6.1 per cent contraction posted in 2023. Meanwhile, aircraft landings climbed by 9.3 per cent year-on-year to reach 47,630 in the fourth quarter, following the 7.5 per cent increase in the third quarter. This brought the total number of aircraft landings in 2024 to 182,951, which was 11.5 per cent higher than in 2023. Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance \n\n65 ACCOMMODATION \n\n## VISITOR ARRIVALS \n\nSingapore received around 3.9 million visitors in the fourth quarter, 13.9 per cent higher compared to the same period a year ago (Exhibit 6.14). Compared to the same quarter in 2019 (pre-pandemic), visitor arrivals remained 17.7 per cent lower. For the full year, visitor arrivals increased by 21.5 per cent, slowing from the 116 per cent expansion in 2023. In terms of source markets, Singapore’s top ten markets in 2024 were China (3.1 million visitors), Indonesia (2.5 million), India (1.2 million), Malaysia (1.2 million), Australia (1.2 million), the Philippines (779 thousand), the USA (692 thousand), South Korea (595 thousand), the UK (580 thousand) and Japan (573 thousand). Together, they accounted for 74.7 per cent of total visitor arrivals in 2024. Among the top 10 source markets, China (126 per cent), Japan (32.4 per cent) and the UK (22.5 per cent) posted the strongest growth in visitor arrivals in 2024 (Exhibit 6.15).

Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n66 \n\n# Chapter 6.6 ACCOMMODATION \n\nIn tandem with the strong recovery in visitor arrivals, gross lettings of gazetted hotel rooms grew by 7.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 7.7 per cent growth in the previous quarter (Exhibit 6.16). Similarly, room revenue expanded by 7.2 per cent, picking up from the 5.2 per cent increase in the preceding quarter. This was accompanied by increases in average room rates and in average occupancy rates of gazetted hotels. Specifically, the average occupancy rate rose by 3.4 percentage points, while the average room rate grew by 0.1 per cent to $271 in the fourth quarter. For 2024 as a whole, the accommodation sector grew by 7.1 per cent, driven by the recovery in tourism demand. The overall room revenue of gazetted hotels climbed by 11.4 per cent to reach $5.3 billion in 2024, driven by a 10.0 per cent expansion in gross lettings and a 1.4 per cent increase in average daily room rates. \n\nExhibit 6.16: Gross Lettings  \n\n> 2023 2024 01000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n> IV III II IIV\n> Thousand -5 0510 15 20 25 Per Cent YoY Change (RHS) Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance\n\n67 FOOD & BEVERAGE SERVICES \n\n## FOOD & BEVERAGE SALES \n\nOverall food & beverage sales volume declined marginally 1year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 1.0 per cent contraction in the preceding quarter (Exhibit 6.17). This was led by declines in the sales volume of fast food outlets (-3.2 per cent), cafes, food courts & other eating places (-2.4 per cent) and restaurants (-1.0 per cent) segments. On the other hand, sales of the food caterers segment continued to grow (14.7 per cent) in tandem with the continued recovery in inbound tourism demand. For the whole of 2024, the food & beverage services volume index declined by 0.5 per cent. This was a reversal from the 3.3 per cent expansion registered in 2023. At the segment level, the sales volumes of food caterers (15.9 per cent) grew, while that of fast food outlets (-5.4 per cent), restaurants (-3.2 per cent) and cafes, food courts & other eating places (-0.7 per cent) shrank. \n\nExhibit 6.17: Changes in Food and Beverage Services Index in Chained Volume Terms \n\n2023 2024 -3 -2 -1 01\n\nIV III II IIV \n\n> Per Cent\n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe food & beverage services sector contracted by 0.3 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 1.3 per cent decline in the previous quarter.

In the third quarter of 2024, the latest period where data is available, total fixed line subscriptions grew by 3.5 per cent. As at October 2024 2, the number of mobile subscriptions grew by 3.8 per cent compared to the same month in 2023 (Exhibit 6.18). While there was a 97.3 per cent decline in the number of 3G subscriptions to 2,200, this was offset by the 0.2 per cent increase in 4G subscriptions to 7.5 million and the 23.9 per cent increase in 5G subscriptions to around 2.2 million. In October 2024, the number of broadband subscriptions rose by 6.3 per cent. The increase was driven by optical fibre broadband (2.1 per cent) and wireless broadband (7.0 per cent) subscriptions. \n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe information & communications sector expanded by 4.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, extending the 4.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter. This positive outturn was largely due to strong growth in the IT & information services and “others” segments 1, while the telecommunications segment contracted during the quarter. For the whole of 2024, the sector grew by 5.0 per cent, a slowdown from the 11.2 per cent expansion in 2023. Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance \n\n69 \n\n# Chapter 6.8 FINANCE & INSURANCE \n\n## OVERALL PERFORMANCE \n\nThe finance & insurance sector grew strongly in 2024, with broad-based expansions recorded across the segments, including banking, fund management, insurance and activities auxiliary to financial services (which largely comprise the payments firms) (Exhibit 6.19). Trading activity was generally elevated during the year amid shifts in global and domestic financial market sentiments, leading to strong growth in net fees and commissions among banks and fund managers. The insurance industry recorded a surge in new premiums among life insurers, while the auxiliary financial services segment benefited from higher cross border transactions associated with greater travel spending. \n\nExhibit 6.20: Growth of Bank Loans and Advances to Non-Bank Residents and Non-Residents (Per Cent) Exhibit 6.19: Finance & Insurance Growth Rates \n\nPer Cent 2023 2024 \n\n0246810 \n\nIV III II IIV \n\n7.4 6.1 5.6 7.4 8.3 \n\n# OVERVIEW \n\nThe finance & insurance sector expanded by 6.1 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, improving from the 5.6 per cent growth in the previous quarter.

Loans to residents rose by 5.2 per cent, driven by business loans to the transport & communications sector, although this was partially offset by the decline in loans extended to manufacturing. \n\n2023 2024 Bank Loans & Advances to Non-Bank Residents -2.4 5.2 Business Loans -3.9 6.2 \n\nBuilding & Construction -0.3 4.3 \n\nTransportation & Communications -4.6 20.4 \n\nNon-Bank Financial Institutions 0.1 5.3 \n\nGeneral Commerce -15.6 7.5 \n\nManufacturing -13.4 -4.2 \n\nBusiness Services 14.3 9.6 \n\nOthers -0.8 6.4 \n\nConsumer Loans -0.1 3.6 \n\nHousing & Bridging Loans 1.3 2.8 \n\nProfessional & Private Individuals -3.5 5.9 \n\nBank Loans & Advances to Non-Bank Non-Residents -3.8 4.1 Americas -6.3 1.0 \n\nEurope 4.1 7.9 \n\nEast Asia -5.0 -0.5 \n\nOthers -2.6 13.4 Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n70 \n\n# Chapter 6.9 Consumer lending also increased, supported in part by housing & bridging loans. Externally, loans to non-residents grew by 4.1 per cent, bolstered by lending to regions outside of East Asia. \n\n## INSURANCE \n\nTotal weighted new business premiums in the life insurance industry increased by 23.3 per cent to $7.8 billion in 2024 (Exhibit 6.21). Single premium business rose by 7.4 per cent to $16.7 billion while regular premium business expanded by 28.5 per cent to $6.1 billion. In the general insurance industry, gross premiums expanded by 2.5 per cent to $19.8 billion in 2024, with offshore and domestic businesses accounting for $14.0 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. \n\nExhibit 6.21: Premiums in the Insurance Industry \n\n## SECURITY DEALING ACTIVITIES \n\nIn 2024, the turnover volume of the securities market fell by 0.7 per cent to 338.4 billion shares, even as portfolios shifted towards non-cash equivalent assets amid the global easing in monetary policy. The turnover volume of the derivatives market grew by 18.4 per cent to 298 contracts in 2024, expanding steadily throughout the year underpinned by elevated futures trading activity (Exhibit 6.22). \n\nExhibit 6.22: Securities and Derivatives Turnover Volumes    \n\n> 050 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n> Derivatives (RHS) Securities\n> Billion Shares Million Contracts\n> 2023 2024 050 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n> $ Billion 0510 15 20\n> General Insurance Industry Life Industry Industry\n> 2023 2024 Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance\n\n71 REAL ESTATE & PROFESSIONAL SERVICES \n\n## REAL ESTATE \n\nThe private residential property market expanded on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter, as total private residential property sales rose by 71.5 per cent, accelerating from the 3.3 per cent increase in the previous quarter. For the full year, total sales rose by 15.3 per cent to 21,950 units, from the 19,044 units sold in 2023. Private residential certified progress payments (a proxy for developers’ margins) rose by 5.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 6.1 per cent increase in the preceding quarter. For the whole of 2024, private residential certified progress payments climbed by 2.4 per cent, moderating from the increase of 11.0 per cent in 2023 (Exhibit 6.23). \n\nExhibit 6.23: Total Sales for Private Residential Units and Private Residential Certified Payments Exhibit 6.24: Total Occupied Space for Private Sector Commercial Office and Retail Spaces \n\nIn the private commercial retail space market, the performance remained resilient in the fourth quarter. Specifically, demand for private commercial retail space (measured by total occupied space) rose by 2.1 per cent year-on-year, extending the 2.8 per cent increase in the third quarter. For the full year, demand for private commercial retail space grew by 2.4 per cent, higher than the 2.0 per cent increase in 2023. Meanwhile, demand for private commercial office space rose by 0.3 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 0.2 per cent growth in the preceding quarter.

Growth in the sector was largely driven by the head offices and business representative offices segment, which expanded by 4.3 per cent. \n\nExhibit 6.25: Total Occupied Space for Private Sector Industrial Space  \n\n> 2023 2024 36 37 38 39 40 41 42\n> IV III II IIV\n> Million Square Metres Chapter 6: Sectoral Performance\n\n73 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK CHAPTER \n\n# 7LEADING INDICATORS \n\nThe composite leading index (CLI) for Singapore fell by 0.8 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the fourth quarter of 2024, following the 0.1 per cent decline in the previous quarter (Exhibit 7.1). Of the nine components of the CLI, six components decreased on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the fourth quarter, namely the stock of finished goods, domestic liquidity, wholesale trade, non-oil sea cargo handled, new companies formed and non-oil retained imports. By contrast, the US Purchasing Managers’ Index, stock price and money supply rose compared to a quarter ago. \n\n## OUTLOOK FOR 2025 \n\nSince the Economic Survey of Singapore in November 2024, major economies have remained resilient, performing largely in line with expectations in the fourth quarter of 2024 amidst rising global economic uncertainty. Singapore’s external demand outlook for 2025 has also remained broadly unchanged, with overall GDP growth in Singapore’s key trading partners expected to ease from 2024’s level. Among the advanced economies, GDP growth in the US is projected to moderate in 2025, as private consumption growth is expected to taper over the course of the year in tandem with easing tightness in the labour market. Nonetheless, there is a large cone of uncertainty surrounding the outlook of the US economy, with its trajectory depending on the policies of the new US administration. By contrast, GDP growth in the Eurozone is likely to improve on the back of stronger consumption growth and a gradual recovery in investments as monetary policy becomes more accommodative. In Asia, China’s GDP growth is expected to moderate on account of a slowdown in merchandise exports and investment growth due to tariff hikes and industrial overcapacity respectively. Meanwhile, growth in the key Southeast Asian economies should remain steady, supported by improving domestic demand and a sustained recovery in tourism demand. At the same time, uncertainties in the global economy remain significant, with the risks tilted to the downside. First, ongoing trade frictions among major economies, alongside lingering risks of escalation in geopolitical conflicts, could lead to higher production costs, as well as greater global economic policy uncertainty. These could in turn dampen global investment and trade, and weigh on global growth. Second, disruptions to the global disinflation process could lead to tighter financial conditions for longer, potentially triggering latent vulnerabilities in banking and financial systems. \n\nExhibit 7.1: Composite Leading Index Levels and Growth Rate \n\n> 98 100 102 104 106 108 110 112 114\n> IV III II IIV III II IIV III II IIV III II I\n> 2015 = 100\n> 2024 2023 2022 2021\n> -30 -25 -20 -15 -10\n> -5 0510 Per Cent QoQ Change (RHS)\n\n# ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n76 \n\n# Chapter 7 Against this backdrop, the manufacturing and trade-related services sectors in Singapore are expected to continue to expand in 2025, although their pace of growth is likely to moderate from 2024 levels. Within the manufacturing sector, the electronics cluster is projected to expand at a steady pace, supported by robust demand for semiconductor chips in the PC, smartphone and data centre end-markets. This will have positive spillover effects on the precision engineering cluster and the machinery, equipment & supplies segment of the wholesale trade sector. At the same time, strong order books in the aerospace and marine & offshore engineering segments should drive growth in the transport engineering cluster. Meanwhile, outward-oriented services sectors such as information & communications and finance & insurance are projected to register healthy growth. The former will be supported by sustained enterprise demand for digital solutions and services, while the latter will be bolstered by stronger demand for cross-border transactions in the region, which will further boost payments processing activities. On the other hand, the growth of consumer-facing sectors such as retail trade and food & beverage services is likely to remain lacklustre, weighed down in part by locals shifting their spending overseas, even though the continued recovery in international visitor arrivals should provide some support. Taking into account the external and domestic economic environment, and barring the materialisation of downside risks, the Singapore economy is projected to expand by \n\n“1.0 to 3.0 per cent” in 2025.

Started by A*STAR in 2003, T-Up aims to help promising local small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as large local enterprises (LLEs) build in-house research and development (R&D) capabilities and grow their revenue, by enabling them to tap on A*STAR’s scientific talent pool. As part of the scheme, A*STAR researchers are seconded to participating local enterprises for up to two years to aid in their R&D projects (see Annex A for examples of these projects). Seconded researchers share product development strategy and impart knowledge in technical areas to support the firm in the development of new products and processes, as well as build up their intellectual property portfolio. At the same time, participating firms are provided funding support by Enterprise Singapore, at up to 70% of allowable costs for SMEs or startups and up to 30% for LLEs, with the support levels capped at S$250,000 per project. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the T-Up programme in enhancing firms’ outcomes in R&D, as well as their revenue, employment, value-added, productivity and wages. The rest of the article is organised as follows. We first present a literature review of the impact that the movement of researchers from public research institutions to private entities has on the private entities. We then describe the data and methodology used in the study before reporting the results. The final section concludes. \n\n## LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nIn the literature, technology transfer is generally seen as essential to boost firms’ competitiveness and foster innovation. Foundational research, which forms the basis of technological advancements, is often conducted by universities and public research institutions (Wrisich et al., 2016). Meanwhile, firms conducting R&D often face significant challenges, including high costs and uncertain outcomes. For SMEs in particular, these challenges are compounded by limited resources and constraints in their capacity to absorb complex technological advancements. To address the impediments to R&D in the private sector, government agencies often promote collaborations, such as through secondments, between public research institutions and the private sector (Hilkenmeier et al., 2021). These partnerships allow firms to adopt advanced technologies more quickly and enhance their overall innovative capacity. 1 We would like to thank Ms Yong Yik Wei, Dr Andy Feng, Ms Jamie Poh, Mr Lee Zen Wea, Dr Gwee Yi Jie and Dr Tan Yi Jin for their useful suggestions and comments. We are also grateful to colleagues from MTI’s Innovation, Research and Development Division, A*STAR as well as Enterprise Singapore for their input. \n\n# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nLaunched in 2003, the Technology for Enterprise Capability Upgrading (T-Up) programme is a secondment programme funded by Enterprise Singapore and administered by A*STAR, where A*STAR’s research scientists and engineers are seconded to local enterprises to help them build in-house research and development (R&D) capabilities and grow their business revenue. This study evaluates the impact of the T-Up programme on participating firms’ outcomes. \n\nOur findings show that firms participating in the T-Up programme spent 65.4 per cent more on R&D and were 8.4 percentage-points more likely to conduct R&D in a given year compared to a control group. They also correspondingly enjoyed 44.3 per cent higher revenue and 21.9 per cent higher employment than the control group. These findings suggest that the T-Up programme has been effective in supporting local firms to upgrade their R&D capabilities and grow their business revenue. Feature Article \n\n81 A review of the empirical literature highlights the positive outcomes of secondment policies and other initiatives involving the movement of researchers from public research institutions to private firms. For instance, Herrera (2010) found that Spanish firms that hired personnel from the public R&D system registered a 2.6 percentage-point (pp) increase in their total R&D intensity, measured as the ratio of total R&D expenditure to total sales. Hilkenmeier et al. (2021) surveyed firms that participated in a public-private partnership programme in Germany where scientists from a public research organisation were temporarily seconded to SMEs to jointly work on projects. The study found that apart from reporting technological advancements in their operations, the majority of the participating firms also engaged in follow-up projects as a result of the partnership. In the local context, an earlier evaluation of the T-Up programme by Ho et al. (2016) found that the seconded researchers imparted new technologies to the participating firms, and also improved the firms’ capacity for learning and innovation. In particular, the T-Up secondment improved firms’ product innovation intensity, which was measured as the percentage of sales derived from new products, by 3.2 per cent. This study extends Ho et al.’s 2016 study in two ways. First, while the previous study relied on survey data, this study leveraged firm-level administrative data, which in turn enabled more robust quantitative methods to be used and more firm outcomes of policy relevance to be examined. Second, this study tracked more recent cohorts of firms that participated in the T-Up programme (i.e., from 2011 to 2018), whereas the previous study covered firms that participated before 2012 when the scheme was at a more nascent stage. \n\n## DATA AND SUMMARY STATISTICS \n\nFor the purpose of our study, we merged three datasets: a longitudinal firm-level administrative dataset containing firms’ characteristics from the Department of Statistics, data on T-Up participants from A*STAR, and data on R&D conducted by firms in Singapore from A*STAR’s National Survey of Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2. The merged dataset contained firm-level data such as revenue, value-added, employment size and age of the firm, as well as R&D-related data 3 like firms’ R&D expenditure. Our study focused on firms that participated in the T-Up programme for the first time between 2011 and 2018. We examined cohorts up to 2018 because the firm-level administrative and A*STAR’s survey datasets at the point of the study were only available up to 2020. 4 This is particularly since the effects of R&D policies may take time to materialise. 5Based on the dataset assembled, a total of 161 firms participated in the T-Up programme between 2011 and 2018. The number ranged from 15 to 30 firms per year throughout the period of analysis, with an average of 20 firms per year (Exhibit 1). The data also showed that T-Up firms tended to be micro and small firms with annual revenue below S$10 million and fewer than 50 employees (Exhibit 2). 2 A*STAR’s National Survey of Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) is conducted annually and provides insights on Singapore’s R&D ecosystem, including information on the R&D performed by firms. 3 R&D-related data are from A*STAR’s RIE Survey, and are subject to entities’ responses. 4 In recent years, the archetype of firms participating in the T-Up programme has evolved, with more T-Up projects involving start-ups within the deep tech, artificial intelligence and biomedical space. However, as we were only able to study T-Up cohorts up to 2018, our results would not incorporate the effects of these recent shifts. 5 Moreover, while around 90% of the T-Up projects last for up to one year, there are some that could last for up to two years. Given that data on firms’ outcomes are only available up to 2020, the 2018 cohort would represent the latest cohort that could be studied.

In particular, compared to non-T-Up firms, T-Up firms had on average (i) higher employment, (ii) higher total R&D expenditure, but (iii) lower productivity (measured as value-added per worker). They were also more likely to be in the manufacturing sector. Given these differences, there is a need to mitigate potential selection biases when examining the impact of the T-Up programme in order to obtain a causal estimate of the impact. To do so, we constructed a group of non-participating firms (i.e., control firms) with characteristics that were comparable to the participating firms (i.e., treated firms) through coarsened exact matching (CEM), with the matching performed separately for each T-Up cohort. The matching variables used included the firm’s age, total R&D expenditure, value-added, value-added per worker, total employment and sector. 6 Exhibit 3 shows that upon matching, firms in the control group were observably more similar to the treated firms in terms of their characteristics. 6 For each cohort, the CEM algorithm was implemented using data in the year prior to the commencement of the T-Up project. For instance, 2014 data was used to identify a suitable control group for the 2015 cohort. 7 Summary statistics were generated based on the pooled data in the year before each cohort’s participation in T-Up (i.e., in the year used for matching). For instance, for the 2015 cohort, the summary statistics were generated using the corresponding data in 2014, as well as 2014 data for control firms. 8 This was preferred to the traditional DiD using two-way fixed effects as the latter could lead to biased estimates when there is staggered treatment timing and treatment heterogeneity across cohorts or time. \n\nBefore Matching After Matching Control Treated Control Treated Firm age (years) 10.9 11.5 12.5 12.4 \n\nTotal R&D expenditure (S$ Thousand) 45.2 222.9 155.7 187.5 \n\nValue-added (S$ Million) 2.1 6.1 2.7 2.2 \n\nValue-added per worker (S$ Thousand) 77.0 44.9 60.2 47.2 \n\nTotal employment 19.6 68.2 34.1 33.3 \n\nShare of manufacturing sector (%) 5.6 33.3 34.0 34.0 \n\nShare of professional services sector (%) 12.4 24.0 21.8 21.8 \n\nExhibit 3: Summary Statistics on Firm Characteristics Before and After Matching 7\n\nAs there were multiple treatment cohorts, we used a staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD) regression model (Wooldridge, 2021) to uncover the causal impact of the T-Up programme on firm outcomes. 8 Our main specification regression was as follows: \n\nY𝑖c t = γic + θtc + ∑ ∑ βc,t · Treat 𝑖 × Cohort c ×Time t + ε𝑖 ct \n\n> c=2011 2020 t=2010 2018\n\nWhere: \n\n• Y𝑖c t is the outcome variable for firm 𝑖 in cohort \n\nc at time \n\nt;\n\n• Treat 𝑖 × Cohort c × Time t is a dummy variable which takes on the value of 1 for the observation at year \n\nt for firm 𝑖 , if firm 𝑖 was treated at year c (i.e., treated firm belonging to cohort c); \n\n• γic denotes the firm × cohort time-invariant fixed effects; \n\n• θtc denotes the year × cohort fixed effects; and \n\n• ε𝑖c t is the error term assumed to be uncorrelated with the independent variable in all time periods. We included firm fixed effects to account for time-invariant firm characteristics (including those not observed in the dataset) that could affect firms’ outcomes (e.g., managerial practices). We also included time fixed effects to control for factors that affected all firms over time (e.g., macroeconomic conditions). The firm and time fixed effects were interacted with cohort fixed effects to ensure that the comparisons were made between treated and control firms within cohorts. Economic Survey of Singapore 2024 \n\n84 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nThe empirical strategy outlined above would be valid only if the trends in the outcomes of the T-Up firms were similar to those of the control firms in the years before the T-Up firms received treatment (i.e., the parallel trends assumption holds). We conducted a parallel trends test to examine this. The second column in Exhibit 4 below shows that none of the outcome variables have statistically significant coefficients in the one to three years before T-Up participation (i.e., τ < 0), indicating that the treatment and control firms displayed similar trends in outcomes prior to the treatment firms’ participation in T-Up. The coefficients of interest, βc,t s, measure the causal impact of the T-Up programme on the outcomes of firms in cohort \n\nc at year t, relative to the base year of 2009. We aggregated combinations of βc,t into event-time (i.e., the time relative to the start year of the project) average treatment effects (ATEs). Specifically, to get the ATE for the year after treatment had started (i.e., the causal impact one year after the firm had started participating in the programme, which we denoted as τ = 1 ), or βτ=1 , we took the average of the coefficients βc=2011,t=2012 , βc=2012,t=2013 , … , βc=2018,t=2019 . Repeating this for different event-times will give us a set of event-time coefficients βτ.We present the results as the averages of several event-time coefficients in Exhibit 4. For example, in the third column, \n\nβτ=0 to 3 is the average of βτ=0 ,…, βτ=3 , which reflects the average annual effect of the T-Up programme from the year of commencement of the T-Up project (i.e., τ = 0 ) to three years after commencement (i.e., τ = 3 ). Likewise, in the fourth column, βτ=0 to 5 shows the average annual effect from the year of commencement of the T-Up project to five years after commencement. \n\n(1) (2) (3) (4) Dependent Variable -3 to -1 years \n\n(β τ=-3 to-1 )\n\n0 to 3 years \n\n(β τ=0 to 3 )\n\n0 to 5 years \n\n(β τ=0 to 5 )\n\nR&D Outcomes \n\nWhether the firm did R&D -4.3pp 8.4pp** 8.9pp** Total R&D expenditure -43.2% 65.4%* 73.2%** Whether the firm filed any patents 0.5pp 1.0pp 0.6pp Patents -0.053 0.054 0.015 Revenue from R&D commercialisation 24.5% 63.5%* 71.8%** \n\nOther Firm Outcomes \n\nRevenue 16.0% 44.3%*** 44.5%*** Total employment 5.5% 21.9%*** 21.8%*** Value-added 12.5% 15.3% 13.5% Value-added per worker 6.6% 0.1% 0.8% Average local wages 4.4% 5.3% 3.3% \n\nExhibit 4: Regression Results \n\n> *, ** and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively\n\nThe results suggest that the T-Up programme had a positive and significant impact on participating firms’ outcomes. 9For the R&D-related outcomes up to three years after starting the T-Up project, we found that the T-Up programme was associated with positive and significant effects on firms’ R&D expenditure. These effects occurred at both the intensive margin – R&D expenditure was 65.4 per cent higher, and extensive margin – the probability of conducting R&D in a given year was 8.4pp higher. Similarly, T-Up firms saw 63.5 per cent higher revenue derived from commercialised products, suggesting that the R&D efforts led to successful commercialisation. The effects on patents-related outcomes were also positive, although not statistically significant. 9 These findings were robust to the inclusion of additional control variables such as other government grants and firm age, different matching specifications, different transformations of the dependent variable (e.g., logs, levels), as well as different specifications of the staggered DiD regressions proposed in the literature (e.g., Callaway and Sant’Anna, 2021). Feature Article \n\n85 In terms of other firm outcomes up to three years after starting the T-Up project, our findings suggest that firms that participated in T-Up had higher revenue (44.3 per cent) and total employment 10 (21.9 per cent) than non-participating firms. While the effects on value-added, value-added per worker and average local wages were positive, they were not statistically significant. Finally, we found that the effects on both R&D-related and other firm outcomes persisted up to five years after the firm started participating in the T-Up programme. 11 \n\n## CONCLUSION \n\nThis study found that the T-Up programme was effective in helping local firms to upgrade their R&D capabilities and grow their business revenue. In particular, participating in T-Up led to improvements in a number of outcomes for the firms, including R&D expenditure, revenue from commercialised products due to R&D, total revenue and total employment. Given these encouraging results, and T-Up’s contribution to RIE 2025’s goal of developing Singapore into an innovation-driven economy, A*STAR will continue to support firms in enhancing their R&D capabilities through T-Up and other R&D-related schemes.

These programmes help employers broaden their talent pool by reskilling mid-career new hires or existing employees into growth job roles with good longer-term prospects, with salary support of up to 90 per cent. 2 The duration of CCPs (typically spanning from three to 24 months) varies according to programme specifications and job requirements. Under the Place-and-Train (PnT) CCP, a company hires a jobseeker and puts him/her through on-the-job training or industry-recognised training to take on a new growth job role that aligns with its business and workforce transformation needs. This study examined the impact of the PnT CCP on the key labour market outcomes (i.e., wages, employment retention) of participants. The rest of the article is organised as follows. We first provide a brief review of the literature relating to active labour market policies (ALMPs). We then describe the data and methodology employed for our study, before reporting our findings. The final section concludes. \n\n## LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nALMPs are government policies aimed at assisting and incentivising individuals to actively look for work and find suitable employment. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), there are four main categories of ALMPs: (i) employment subsidies, (ii) self-employment/start-up support, (iii) training, and (iv) public work/public sector jobs. 3 The efficacy of ALMPs has been extensively studied in the literature, with findings generally indicating positive labour market outcomes for individuals over the medium to long run. 1 We would like to thank Ms Yong Yik Wei, Dr Kuan Ming Leong and Mr Alphonsus Gomez for their useful suggestions and comments. We are also grateful to WSG for their inputs to this study. All remaining errors belong to the authors. 2 Long-term unemployed or/and mature jobseekers aged 40 and above are eligible for higher funding support of 90%. 3 See OECD (2018) for more details. \n\n# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nWorkforce Singapore’s (WSG) Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) are placement-centric programmes that aim to address structural mismatches in the labour market. Under the Place-and-Train (PnT) CCP, a company hires a jobseeker and puts him/her through on-the-job training or industry-recognised training to take on a new growth job role that aligns with its business and workforce transformation needs. \n\nOur study evaluated the impact of the PnT CCP and found that it improved the labour market outcomes of participants. Specifically, the PnT CCP (i) increased participants’ wages by 2.5 per cent in the year of placement, with the impact rising further to 5.8 per cent to 6.5 per cent in the subsequent four years, and (ii) improved their employment retention by 3.9 percentage-points, compared to their control groups. Notably, the PnT CCP had a stronger impact on non-PMET and mature workers who were found to have benefitted more from the placement and accompanying training. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of rapid technological change, these findings suggest that schemes that target structural mismatches (including WSG’s PnT CCP) play a key role in addressing skills gaps and helping workers to take on growth job opportunities. By aligning talent with industry needs through the CCPs, workers can be empowered to pivot into future-ready roles, thereby enhancing their adaptability and resilience in a fast-evolving and dynamic Singapore economy. Feature Article \n\n91 Exhibit 1: Share of PMET and Mature Participants by Cohort, 2017-2022 \n\nFor instance, Vooren et al. (2019) examined 57 ALMP studies in OECD countries and found that training programmes had a positive impact on wages, employment probability and employment duration around six to 36 months after the start of the programme. Similarly, Card et al. (2018) found that training and retraining programmes had positive effects on wages, employment probability and employment duration around one to three years after programme completion. Estimating the impact of job placement programmes on participants with higher earnings, Autor et al. (2017) found that direct-hire placements significantly increased earnings over one to two years for half or more of all placed participants. \n\n## DATA AND SUMMARY STATISTICS \n\nThis study merged two key data sources: (i) data on participants placed in WSG’s PnT CCP from 2017 to 2022 and (ii) an individual-level administrative dataset containing information on the demographic characteristics, employment history and wages of all resident employees in Singapore. 4 We excluded participants with less than three months of employment records in the company they were placed in given that the typical PnT CCP duration exceeded three months. Consequently, our final sample comprised over 17,900 PnT participants placed between 2017 and 2022. Most PnT participants were (i) placed in Professional, Manager, Executive and Technician (PMET) roles and (ii) under 40 years of age (i.e., non-mature workers) (Exhibit 1). In particular, the share of PnT participants placed in PMET roles ranged from 74 per cent to 92 per cent between 2017 and 2022. Across the years, the share of mature workers remained relatively stable at around 40 per cent. 4 We used data from 2014 to 2023 from the individual-level administrative dataset to match PnT CCP participants with a control group of non-participants based on pre-placement characteristics, as well as to track their outcomes over time. More details can be found in the ‘Methodology’ section. Between 2017 and 2022, most PnT participants enrolled in programmes that lasted six to 11 months (41-63 per cent) or less than six months (32-43 per cent) (Exhibit 2). Programmes with a duration of 12 months or more had fewer participants. Over the period, the share of participants enrolled in longer programmes fell as WSG sharpened its focus towards shorter programmes that could more nimbly support businesses’ hiring and reskilling needs.               \n\n> 73.6% 77.8% 77.4% 77.6% 79.8% 91.9% 41.5% 40.2% 41.9% 42.5% 41.0% 35.9% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 PMET Participants Mature Participants\n> Source: MOM Economic Survey of Singapore 2024\n\n92 METHODOLOGY \n\nTo estimate the causal impact of the PnT CCP, we combined matching methods with a difference-in-differences (DiD) regression analysis. This multi-step approach allowed us to compare the wage and employment retention outcomes of two groups of individuals: a “treated” group that participated in the PnT CCP and an observably-similar “control” group that did not participate in the PnT CCP. First, to study the impact of the PnT CCP on wage outcomes, we used Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) to find a group of non-participants who was similar in observable characteristics to each cohort of PnT participants. The matched characteristics included age, gender, firm size, sector of employment, and employment history (i.e., wages and number of months worked over the past three years) in the year prior to each cohort’s placement in the programme. 5 The CEM technique enabled the construction of matched control groups that were comparable to the PnT participants. Second, after matching, we performed the following DiD regression, separately for each cohort, to study the impact of the PnT CCP on the wage outcomes of participants: 5 For each cohort, the CEM algorithm was implemented using data in the year before each cohort’s placement (e.g., for the 2019 cohort, data from 2018 was used to identify a suitable non-participant group). \n\nExhibit 2: Share of PnT Participants with Different Training Durations by Cohort, 2017-2022                      \n\n> 34% 41% 35% 32% 41% 43% 41% 42% 54% 63% 51% 51% 25% 17% 11% 5% 8% 6% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 <6 Months 6-11 Months 12 Months & Above\n> Source: MOM\n\nWhere: \n\n• Y𝑖 t represents the log mean monthly wage for individual 𝑖 in calendar year \n\nt;\n\n• Treated 𝑖 is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if individual 𝑖 is treated (i.e., a PnT participant); \n\n• year t are the dummies from year c-3 (three years before placement) to c+6 (up to six years after placement) for cohort c;\n\n• α𝑖 are the individual fixed effects; \n\n• δt are the time fixed effects; \n\n• X𝑖 t are the time-varying covariates (e.g., age, number of months worked, firm size and sector of employment); and \n\n• ε𝑖 t is the regression error term. \n\nY𝑖 t = α𝑖 + δt + ∑ βt Treated 𝑖 × year t + X𝑖 t + ε𝑖 t\n\n> t=c-3\n> c+6 Feature Article\n\n93 6 In the absence of treatment (i.e., placement in CCP), outcomes for the treatment and control groups should follow the same trend over time. 7 The PnT CCP typically lasts for three to 24 months, with the placement month considered as month 0. Therefore, for a training programme with a three-month duration, the first month after the training would be three months after placement. The pre-treatment coefficients βc-3 and βc-2 were used to test for pre-treatment trends and should be small and/or not statistically significant to support the parallel trends assumption. 6 The post-treatment coefficients βc, … βc+6 indicated the impact of the programme on wages in the year of treatment up to six years post-treatment. Third, to examine the effect on employment retention from the start of placement, we identified a control group of individuals who had similarly begun a new job at around the same time as the PnT participants were placed in the programme. Specifically, we matched all PnT participants to non-participants based on the month and year of the latter’s first instance of a job switch within the period studied (i.e., 2017 to 2022), in addition to the characteristics used in the earlier CEM matching. Fourth, we performed a probit regression to compare the probability of remaining in employment for the PnT participants and their matched counterparts. We estimated the probability of remaining in employment (i.e., βm) in each month after placement or upon taking on a new job (i.e., starting from three to 24 months 7 after placement or taking on a new job) using the following probit regression: \n\nPr (Y𝑖 m) = βm Treated 𝑖 + X𝑖 + ε𝑖 \n\nWhere: \n\n• Y𝑖 m is a dummy variable for whether individual 𝑖 remains in employment m months after placement / taking on a new job; \n\n• Treated 𝑖 is the dummy variable taking the value of 1 if individual 𝑖 is treated (i.e., a PnT participant); \n\n• X𝑖 are the individual’s characteristics in the year before placement / taking on a new job (e.g., age, number of months worked, firm size and sector of employment, month-year of job switch); and \n\n• ε𝑖 is the regression error term. Finally, we performed heterogeneity analyses to examine whether there were differences in the wage outcomes of PMET compared to non-PMET PnT participants, as well as mature compared to non-mature PnT participants, following the methodology described in the first and second steps. \n\n## RESULTS \n\nWe found that the PnT CCP increased the wages of participants across all cohorts. Specifically, the PnT CCP raised the wages of participants by 2.5 per cent on average in the year of placement, with the impact rising further to 5.8 per cent to 6.5 per cent in the subsequent four years (Exhibit 3). These results were robust to running a stacked regression, with each cohort’s dataset stacked together to form a combined dataset.

On average, the retention rate for PnT participants was 3.9 percentage-points (pp) higher than that of non-participants. The difference in retention rate was the largest, at about 4.7pp, around six months after placement. Even at the 24-month mark, the employment retention rate for PnT participants (90.3 per cent) remained 3.7pp higher than that for non-participants (86.6 per cent) (Exhibit 4). \n\nExhibit 3: Average Impact of the PnT CCP on Wages by Years Post-Placement \n\n> Source: Authors’ estimates Notes: The parallel trend assumption was met for all cohorts.

The average wage effects for five and six years post-placement were omitted from Exhibit 3, as only at most two cohorts (i.e., 2017 and 2018) had available data to reach these points of time.\n\nExhibit 4: Retention Rate for PnT Participants and Non-Participants \n\n97.5% 93.6% 92.0% 90.3% 92.7% 89.8% 88.5% 86.6% 75% 80% 85% 90% 95% 100% 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Number of Months Post Placement PnT Participants Matched Control Average difference from 3 to 24 months = 3.9pp 4.7pp 3.8pp 3.4pp 3.7pp \n\n> Source: Authors’ estimates\n\nFeature Article \n\n95 Finally, our heterogeneity analyses highlighted that the impact of the PnT CCP differed across occupational (PMET and non-PMET) and demographic (mature and non-mature) groups, even though participation in the programme benefitted all groups. Notably, the PnT CCP had a stronger impact on non-PMET and mature (aged 40 years and above) workers, who were found to benefit more from the placement and accompanying training. In the four years post-placement, non-PMET PnT participants experienced stronger wage gains (approximately 2pp higher) than PMET PnT participants (Exhibit 5). The PnT CCP likely assisted non-PMET workers to switch into growth job roles with more potential, leading to better outcomes in wages. Similarly, mature PnT participants saw stronger wage increases (approximately 3.1pp higher) than their non-mature counterparts (Exhibit 6). The higher salary support for mature workers likely incentivised businesses to hire and train mature workers previously in lower-potential jobs, who then benefitted from a larger wage uplift in their new growth job roles. \n\nExhibit 5: Average Impact of the PnT CCP on Wages in the Four Years Post-Placement by Participants’ Broad Occupation Exhibit 6: Average Impact of the PnT CCP on Wages in the Four Years Post-Placement by Participants’ Age Group   \n\n> 7.0% 5.0% 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% Non-PMET Partipicants PMET Participants 2pp 8.8% 5.7% 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% Mature Participants Non-Mature Participants 3.1pp\n\n## CONCLUSION \n\nIn summary, our study found that the PnT CCP improved participants’ labour market outcomes. Reflecting the programme’s effectiveness in reskilling workers for new job roles, PnT participants experienced higher wages and employment retention. In particular, the PnT CCP was found to have a stronger beneficial impact on non-PMET and mature workers. The positive outcomes of the PnT CCP underscore the significance of subsidised on-the-job training in Singapore’s skills development landscape. Against the backdrop of rapid technological change, these findings suggest that schemes that target structural mismatches (including WSG’s PnT CCP) play a key role in addressing skills gaps and helping workers to take on growth job opportunities. Recognising the importance of CCPs, WSG increased the CCP salary support caps in April 2024 to keep pace with rising wages and maintain the programme’s attractiveness to employers, which would in turn help more workers take up more productive job roles and create more career conversion opportunities. 8 By aligning talent with industry needs through CCPs, workers can be empowered to pivot into future-ready roles, thereby enhancing their adaptability and resilience in a fast-evolving and dynamic Singapore economy. Source: Authors’ estimates 8 From 1 April 2024, the PnT CCP supported: (i) up to 90% of monthly salary (capped at $7,500 per month) for long-term unemployed or/and mature (40 years and above) Singapore residents, and (ii) up to 70% of monthly salary (capped at $5,000 per month) for other Singapore residents. Previously, the monthly salary caps were $6,000 and $4,000 respectively.

Spin on Wheels of Productivity\")\n\n Forum Letter Reply \n\n|\n\n 06 MAY 2015 \n\nMNCs, SMEs play important roles in S’pore economy\n=================================================\n\n### MNCs, SMEs play important roles in S’pore economy\n\nI thank Mr Kong Pih Shu and Mr Woon Wee Min for their letters “Have tax incentives for MNCs paid off?” (April 29) and “Tax breaks for MNCs pay off in many ways” (May 2).\n\nSingapore has developed a vibrant and diversified corporate ecosystem that grows our economy and creates good jobs for Singaporeans. Multinational companies (MNCs) play a significant role in our economic development.\n\nLast year, MNCs committed S$11.8 billion in fixed asset investments and S$7 billion in annual business expenditure. These investments are expected to create 16,100 skilled jobs. MNCs also helped to anchor and grow key new sectors, such as clean technology.\n\nOur small and medium enterprises (SMEs), too, have benefitted as suppliers and subcontractors to MNCs. The Economic Development Board’s Partnerships for Capability Transformation scheme has also helped MNCs to transfer technological capabilities to SMEs.\n\nAs in many other countries, tax incentives support Singapore’s economic growth and promote investment. The incentives are granted to companies with substantive economic activities here, which will add value significantly to our economy and create employment.\n\nIncentive recipients are subject to audits to ensure commitments are met, and programmes are reviewed regularly. Besides tax incentives, MNCs are attracted by Singapore’s strategic location, strong connectivity, trusted legal and regulatory framework, and talent pool.\n\nWhile MNCs play an important role in our economy, the Government remains committed to supporting our SMEs. Last year, Spring Singapore assisted more than 9,000 SMEs through some 12,000 upgrading projects to boost productivity and competitiveness and capture growth opportunities.\n\nTogether with its partners, Spring also reached out to some 160,000 SMEs last year with other forms of assistance such as business advisory services and toolkits. Similarly, International Enterprise Singapore helped 22,400 SMEs in their overseas expansion last year.\n\nWe will continue to work with industry partners to create an environment conducive to doing business for both SMEs and MNCs.\n\n**Mrs Cindy Keng**\n\n**Director, Corporate Communications Division**\n\n**Ministry of Trade and Industry**\n\n* * *\n\n Share Article

During the late 1950s and 1960s, the population had increased substantially and the government had to relocate the growing population from overcrowded squatter villages to new HDB housing estates. Land was also required for industrial development, and construction of roads, schools, community and recreational facilities.3\n\nPrior to the Land Acquisition Act, the government’s ability to acquire private land was governed by the Land Acquisition Ordinance, 1955. Although the Land Acquisition Ordinance empowered the government to acquire private land compulsorily for public projects, it did not prevent landowners from increasing the prices of their lands in an area earmarked for such projects.4 As a result, this raised the land acquisition cost and made low-cost public projects difficult or impossible.5\n\nTo prevent landowners from making unreasonable profits out of land to be acquired for public development, the government introduced the Land Acquisition Bill, which was approved by parliament on 26 October 1966.6 The Land Acquisition Act came into effect on 17 June the following year.Any dispute over the compensation amount was referred to an Appeals Board.7 The act also widened the government’s powers of acquisition to meet various situations arising from the ongoing urban renewal and industrialisation programmes as well as in cases of extreme urgency.8\n\n**Biggest landowner******The 1967 Land Acquisition Act enabled the government to step up its land acquisition programme. Between 1959 and 1984, the government acquired a total of 43,713 acres of land, which constituted about one-third of the total land area of Singapore at the time.9 The bulk of this land bank was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act after 1967.10 The government became the biggest landowner by 1985, owning 76.2 percent of land in Singapore, more than double the 31 percent in 1949.11\n\nBetween 1963 and 1985, the HDB constructed over 500,000 flats to provide accommodation at affordable prices for over 80 percent of Singapore’s total population.12 The JTC was able to establish 20 industrial estates, including the 6,500-ha Jurong Industrial Estate by the end of 1985. In total, there were some 3,070 factories in the estates employing about 217,000 workers or 70 percent of Singapore’s manufacturing workforce.13\n\nBesides allowing the construction of affordable housing and industrial estates, cheaper and more effective land acquisition also permitted better urban planning. This benefited the redevelopment plans of the URA and its predecessor, the Urban Redevelopment Department, in the central area, leading to the growth of the commercial and business district in downtown Singapore.14\n\n**Authors**\n\nShaun Oon & Lim Tin Seng\n\n**References**1.“[New Land Acquisition Law Comes into Effect](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19670617-1.2.37),”_Straits Times_, 17 June 1967, 7;Ngiam Tong Dow, “[Taking Over Private Turf for Public’s Good](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/today20070202-2.2.9.9),”_Today,_ 2 February 2007, 12.(From NewspaperSG)\n\n2.Ngiam, “[Taking Over Private Turf](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/today20070202-2.2.9.9).”\n\n3.N.

The act also regulated the amount of compensation to be given to landowners who had their properties acquired by the government.[[2]](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#2)\n\nThe Land Acquisition Act was passed by parliament on 26 October 1966 and came into effect on 17 June the following year. Any disputes between the government and landowners over the compensation amounts were presided over by an Appeals Board.[[3]](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#3) To further expedite government developmental projects through land acquisition, the act was amended in 1973 in order to curb land speculation and limit the cost of land acquisition. The revised act fixed the compensation amount for acquired land at the market value as at 30 November 1973 or at the date of gazette notification, whichever was lower.[[4]](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#4)\n\nThe Land Acquisition Act expedited the process of land possession by the government for public purposes. Between 1959 and 1984, the government acquired a total of 43,713 acres (17,690 ha or 177 sq km) of land, which constituted about one-third of the total land area of Singapore then.[[5]](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#5) The bulk of land, however, was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act after 1967.[[6]](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#6) With an increase in acquired land parcels, the government became the biggest landowner by 1985. At the time, the government owned 76.2 percent of the land in Singapore compared with 31 percent in 1949.[[7]](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#7)\n\nThe compulsory acquisition of land by the government was effective in keeping the costs of building houses and industrial premises affordable.[[8]](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#8) Cheaper and more effective land acquisition also resulted in better urban planning that facilitated the urban renewal efforts carried out by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and its predecessor the Urban Renewal Department in the central area, which led to the growth of the commercial and business district in downtown Singapore.[[9]](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6#9)\n\n**References**\n\n[](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6)1.

Already, GBA is Greater China’s most economically prosperous region and has already reported a gross domestic product equivalent to Italy’s at $2.36 trillion.\n\nMany international and Asian businesses, as well as start-up companies are flocking over to GBA to capitalise on the region’s growth potential and to be at the forefront of change, innovation and technology hub. Each city within GBA has something unique to offer as well, which appeals to a wide variety of organisations that are looking to centralise and consolidate their research and development (R&D) efforts, high-quality manufacturing and investments in Asia.\n\n![Image 1: greater bay area offers talent and innovation opportunities](https://www.randstad.com.hk/s3fs-media/hk/public/styles/blog_article/public/2022-06/greater-bay-area-talent-innovation.png?itok=5ncHaGWY)![Image 2: greater bay area offers talent and innovation opportunities](https://www.randstad.com.hk/s3fs-media/hk/public/styles/lazy_load_default/public/2022-06/greater-bay-area-talent-innovation.png?itok=eaawjG5W)\n\nA former British colony, Hong Kong SAR is a multi-national city that bridges the east and west. A city that prides itself on its bilingual and international talent pool, the financial hub helps facilitate the financial interest and business commercialisation within GBA as well as with the Asia Pacific and the western markets. The[Wealth Management Connect](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/wealth/china-kick-off-long-awaited-wealth-connect-wrapping-hk-macau-2021-09-10/ \"China Launches Wealth Connect\") that was introduced in September 2021 will bring an estimated combined fund flows valued at $46 billion to the region.\n\nAs one of the largest and fastest-growing economies in China, Guangdong is home to Shenzhen province as well as Zhuhai and Shantou, which makes it the perfect sandbox destination for companies to drive innovation as well as manufacture new products and services. The highly-innovative ecosystem has attracted direct investment from entrepreneurs from all over the world to kick-start and commercialise their ideas and concepts.\n\nWhile GBA is also known to be an innovation hub that offers great business opportunities and a promising growth journey for everyone, it actually has a fairly targeted approach. In other words, their eyes are set on the prize. GBA also allows business leaders to tap on world-class talent and their schemes have been largely focused on specific sectors, which include emerging technologies such as healthtech, artificial intelligence and robotics, biotechnology and smart manufacturing. Infrastructure projects have also been designed to increase connectivity between the provinces to create a smart city network to facilitate a seamless flow of communication and talent.\n\nRandstad Greater China’s recruitment strategies are aligned with the GBA developments and goals as well. In particular, we invest in enhancing our recruitment efforts and HR solutions to provide world-class services in areas such as R&D, technology developments as well as sales & marketing. Within the R&D industry, Randstad recruiters are a strategic partner and specialised in supporting the human capital developments in semiconductor and smart manufacturing to drive technological innovation.\n\nEven as China is on a growth trajectory to overtake the U.S. as the largest economy in the world, organisations continue to face persistent challenges that hinder their growth - and one of them is talent.\n\ntalent schemes to help organisations attract new talent to GBA\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe governments have implemented new talent schemes and policies to support the organisations’ recruitment efforts of hiring skilled talent in GBA. The[Technology Talent Admission Scheme](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/TECHTAS.html \"Talent Admission Scheme\") (TechTAS) that was introduced in 2020 aims to fast-track approvals for companies to admit non-local technology talent for R&D roles in Hong Kong SAR. Similarly, the[Quality Migrant Admission Scheme](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/quality_migrant_admission_scheme.html \"Talent Admission Scheme\") provides companies more flexibility to hire experienced professionals with in-demand expertise and skills to work in the city.\n\nThe Chinese government has also revised the individual income tax rate from 45% to 15% for eligible foreign talent to attract more professionals to move to GBA for work. This 30% reduction in income tax would be a useful persuasion tool that employers can use to attract more talent from other mainland China cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, as well as expatriate workers from Singapore, Canada and Australia to relocate to GBA.\n\nThese grants and schemes go a long way to attract new talent to move to GBA. However, the onus is on the employers to ensure that they fulfill the last mile job match by engaging workers in interesting job content, meaningful work and useful employee benefits to retain them in GBA.\n\nwhile high salaries and bonuses are attractive, candidates want more than that\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBeing faced with the persistent challenge of being able to attract and retain skilled talent, many employers are offering jobs that often come with high salaries and bonuses. For instance, many organisations are willing to pay above market average for talent who are trilingual, have a wide network of customers in Greater China or are equipped with niche skills such as data sciences, software engineering and manufacturing technology.\n\nHowever, that may not be enough to persuade candidates to take up a job in GBA.\n\nCandidates’ expectations of what constitutes a good employer have become more complex over the years. The concept of loyally working in the same job from 9 to 5 every day for years no longer applies in modern society. A pay that is simply above the market rate may not be the only factor to workers now. The dynamic between talent and employers has shifted significantly over the last two years, and there is a heightened sense of purpose that now guides people’s career choices and the work they choose to do.\n\nIn the 2022 Randstad[Workmonitor Survey](https://www.randstad.com/workforce-insights/global-hr-research/randstad-workmonitor/ \"A New Era in the #HowWeWork Revolution\"), 33% of respondents working in Asia Pacific markets said that they have quit a job because it doesn’t fit into their personal lives. Workers in the Asia Pacific region were more likely to reject job offers if these didn’t include flexible hours (cited by 44%) or remote options (43%). More than half (56%) of respondents in mainland China held such sentiments regarding remote working, and nearly as many (49%) felt this way about flexible hours.To attract the right talent, business leaders and employers must play an active role in meeting candidate expectations and development to support their workforce in achieving their career plan.\n\nimprove diversity and social cohesion to improve GBA’s ability to retain workforce\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe GBA may have a huge market potential, but the lack of diversity that has resulted in putting lives at risk can be tracked as far back as to an invention in 1959 - the car seat belt. In the past, companies only used “male” crash test dummies, which are manufactured using the weight, height and physics of an average male. It was not until 2004 when “female” crash test dummies were deployed, and even so, they are usually just a smaller size dummy that does not take into account the female anatomy.\n\n![Image 3: social cohesion gba community](https://www.randstad.com.hk/s3fs-media/hk/public/styles/blog_article/public/2022-06/gba-community.png?itok=cKaYTWZ6)![Image 4: social cohesion gba community](https://www.randstad.com.hk/s3fs-media/hk/public/styles/lazy_load_default/public/2022-06/gba-community.png?itok=gPJTz9x3)\n\nDiversity and social cohesion are key ingredients of a flourishing innovation economy. As a melting pot of cultures, GBA offers more than just the tremendous opportunities for business developments and it is up to companies and employees to discover and take advantage of that.\n\nA diverse population is an important asset for businesses as employers will have access to a greater range of talent who would have insights into the motivations and demands of your stakeholders and customer base. As with the example of the car seat belt, companies with a diverse workforce would be able to commercialise a service or product that will be more relevant and useful to a larger population, leading to a more successful and profitable business.\n\nSocial cohesion is another area where companies in GBA need to work together on. Social cohesion is the “glue” that brings workers together and it helps to lessen the frictions that are often associated with management changes. It is more than just about “getting along” with one another, but being able to truly understand each other’s motivations, characteristics and challenges. When employees recognise their similarities and acknowledge their differences, they are more likely to support one another and collaborate to overcome barriers together as a team.\n\nRight now, companies in GBA are not actively integrating their talent to the community and in the workplace. This would come as a culture shock to expatriates who have relocated for work, as many may feel lonely if they don’t have the opportunity to build meaningful relationships with their co-workers or find a purpose for continuing their careers in GBA.\n\nEmployers play a key role and need to purposefully develop and implement HR policies and initiatives that are designed to help bring their people together to find commonalities and similarities with one another. Company events and offsites are a great way to do that. Leisure activities help employees relax and let their hair down, and create a chance for them to know one another on a more personal level. Companies can also use this as an opportunity to reward and recognise their employees’ contributions.\n\nAnother way to build social cohesion is through collaborations and mentorship programmes. The[InnoLife Healthtech Hub](https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2021/10/20211007/20211007_160546_947.html \"Healthtech Hub Pools Research Talent\") and[Youth Employment Scheme](https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/opportunities/youth.html \"Youth Development\") provides companies in GBA the opportunities to collaborate with local universities and scientific research institutions to drive R&D and innovation. Organisations that offer holistic coaching programmes and exciting avenues for employees to work on innovative projects together are more likely to be able to build a more collective and socially cohesive workforce.\n\nzero-COVID strategy will continue to present hurdles for organisations, but it won’t stop them from hiring more talent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCertain provinces of Greater China may still be in lockdown or face tight measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 when this article is published. The zero-COVID policy, if continued as other countries open up - could diminish the benefits and significance of a highly-connected network of cities, as talent will not be able to travel freely between the two special administrative regions and the nine cities in Guangdong.\n\nFlexible work arrangement is an employee benefit that underlines a greater human need - the freedom to work wherever they want, whenever they want. Travel bubbles that use strict testing regimes to replace quarantine requirements between the GBA cities could help facilitate a seamless flow of communication and talent, which would create more business avenues and improve social cohesion.\n\nUntil then, organisations will continue their relentless pursuit of attracting skilled talent from all around the world to GBA to drive innovation and business growth.\n\n### work with randstad\n\nIf finding high performing leaders and talent remains a key challenge for you, [reach us out](https://www.randstad.com.hk/employers/hr-solutions/ \"Bespoke HR Solutions\") to help you find the best talent for your future workforce.

China’s ‘next big thing’\n\nThe Greater Bay Area: China’s ‘next big thing’\n==============================================\n\n![Image 1: The Greater Bay Area. Hong Kong-Guangdong border on Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge](https://media.realinstitutoelcano.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/20270728-post-ballesteros-great-bay-area-project.jpg)\n\n港珠澳大桥-粤港界\n\n![Image 2: Alfonso Ballesteros](https://media.realinstitutoelcano.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/alfonso-ballesteros-74x74.jpg)\n\nAlfonso Ballesteros\n\nPosted on 28 Jul 2022 // \n\n[China, the US and the new world order](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/topic/china-the-us-and-the-new-world-order/)\n\n_The South China Morning Post_, Hong Kong’s most prestigious newspaper has defined the Greater Bay Area project as ‘The next big thing’ for China. However, few people outside Asia are aware of what the project really entails.\n\nThe Greater Bay Area (or GBA) [is a Chinese government project to connect 11 cities in the South of China](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/chinas-growing-assertiveness-in-the-south-china-sea/): Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Macau plus another seven supporting cities on Mainland China into a single economic and business hub. With an area slightly larger than the Netherlands, a population greater than Germany and a GDP equivalent to South Korea, the block has a larger economy than either Spain or Russia. If it were a country, it would be among the world’s top 10 economies.\n\nThe GBA project is one of the most notable developments in the global economic playing field. It can be better understood as part of a push to make China a technological powerhouse. It brings together the factory of the world (Guangzhou), [China’s Silicon Valley (Shenzhen),](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/investing-in-china-still-room-for-growth/) one of the world’s main financial centres (Hong Kong), the ‘Las Vegas of Asia’ (Macau) and a hinterland of various industrial cities, all within a short distance of each other, to create a megalopolis of 86 million people. China’s plan is to turn the region into a new engine for growth and innovation with a GDP that could reach the size of Germany’s in less than 20 years and set the standards in many advanced industries, such as 6G, AI, FinTech, Smart Cities, robotics, biotech and ESG, among others.\n\nThis is the continuation of the type of initiatives that have made China into what it is today. In fact, Shenzhen was the first Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in China, the testing ground that served as an example for other similar experiments throughout the country and that brought [about China’s economic miracle](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/archive/opinion/china-has-changed-the-global-economic-order-with-the-help-of-europe/). Shenzhen was chosen for its proximity to Hong Kong. The then British colony played a key role as a source of investment and knowhow that helped propel Shenzhen from a town of barely 50,000 people to the sprawling metropolis of 12 million that it is today. Meanwhile, the entire Guangdong province experienced an accelerated process of industrialisation that turned it into ‘the factory of the World’. Now, 40 years after those initial reforms, China is betting once again on the Hong Kong-Shenzhen-Guangzhou connection to propel itself into the next stage of development to become a fully developed economy.\n\nThe GBA is trying to achieve several key objectives at once. On the one hand, China is now an upper-middle income country with a slowing economic growth and a rapidly ageing population, which is a dangerous situation to be in. Despite the economic successes of the past decades, there is a risk it could fall into the middle-income trap. China is well aware of this and is trying to avoid such a situation by boosting high value-added industries and international projection. This helps explain the connection with the other key elements of its strategy for the coming decades: Made in China 2025, China Standards 2035, the Belt and Road Initiative, [the dual circulation development paradigm and the internationalisation of the yuan (RMB).](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/rmb-internationalization-and-the-bri-reality-or-fantasy/) They are all different aspects of one overarching effort to avoid the middle-income trap, set China at the forefront of innovation and technology and guarantee its commercial and technological self-reliance. There is also one more layer: the further integration of both Hong Kong and Macao into southern China, reinterpreting their relationship with the mainland. If fully realised, this vision has the potential to completely change the face of the region.\n\nIn fact, the development of the GBA is accorded the status of a key strategic plan in the country’s development blueprint and is expected to play a pivotal role under the current Five-Year Plan (2021-25). It is a vital topic of discussion and is contemplated as a priority by all levels of the administration and across the business world. So much so that the powerful National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) [has created a special fund from the Central Government’s Budget](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/the-new-silk-road-grand-geopolitical-engineering/) to directly finance some of the most ambitious projects in the GBA. The fund will complement the municipal and regional level budget allocations.\n\nThe GBA project involves promoting integration across many fronts: infrastructure, legislation, visas, taxation, work permits, company set-ups and stock exchange connections. In all, there are 12 official policy areas. While integrating the nine mainland Chinese cities presents relatively minor difficulties, successfully integrating Hong Kong and Macao into the mix is a very different story. The former European colonies have their own official languages as well as their own political, legal, monetary and financial systems and they even drive on the opposite side of the road. Successfully bringing together these different environments into a coherent whole is a daunting task and one that will likely take decades to accomplish.\n\nOn the infrastructure front the key objective is to achieve a ‘one-hour living circle’. Some of the main projects have already been completed. A good example is the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. The 55-kilometre bridge-tunnel system is both the longest sea crossing and the longest open-sea fixed link in the world (as a reference, the English Channel is 33.3 km at its narrowest point) and is symbolic of the kind of infrastructure that will soon interconnect the area. The high-speed rail connecting Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou is another iconic example.\n\nFinancial services also stand out as a major area of development. In late 2021 the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) signed a Memorandum to provide a one-stop platform [to allow financial institutions and tech firms to launch pilot tests either side of the border](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/where-is-china-heading-to-2021/). Similarly, another major landmark was the launch of the ‘Wealth Management Connect’, allowing residents across the GBA to invest in wealth management products in each other’s markets.\n\nAnother pillar of the strategy is to promote entrepreneurship and STEM education (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), especially among the young. To achieve this the Youth Development Commission has rolled out two funding schemes under the Youth Development Fund: the Entrepreneurship Scheme (which will subsidise entrepreneurship projects); and the Experiential Scheme (which will subsidise short-term experiential projects with special emphasis on IT). The region has world class Technology Parks in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Hong Kong, which provide incubation, acceleration and funding programmes to further propel start-ups to become scalable businesses.\n\nSome of the most notable future developments involve innovation-related projects such as the ‘Lok Ma Chau Innovation and Technology Park’, which will be managed simultaneously by the Hong Kong and Shenzhen authorities. On the same border between the two cities, the Hong Kong Government recently announced its intention to build a ‘Northern Metropolis’. The plan, which would take 20 years to complete, is seen as a major strategic change for development, moving the city’s centre of gravity away from its traditional centre on Hong Kong Island up north, to integrate it into the latest national development plan. There are also plans to allow Hong Kong citizens to work and live visa-free in the GBA while continuing to pay taxes in the SAR.\n\nAlthough [the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic](https://especiales.realinstitutoelcano.org/coronavirus/?lang=en) has put a halt to some of the initiatives, the level of governmental and business support for the project indicates that it will continue to move forward despite the delays. In this respect, China is likely to succeed in making the GBA a more coherent whole and in leveraging the process to spur growth and innovation. Whether this will help it achieve all its strategic objectives remains difficult to determine. What is clear is that, in any case, the initiative will have a notable impact on the global economic scenario and will play a key role in China’s overall strategy for the 21 st century.\n\n* * *\n\nImage: Hong Kong-Guangdong border on Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, an infrastructure part of the Great Bay Area project.

Based on a variety of sources and data, I argue that these two SWFs, Temasek Holdings and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, are state-sanctioned means to secure the economic future of Singapore; they are not strategic devices developed by the Singapore government to pose geopolitical or economic threats on other states. Over time, their economic functions and strategic orientations have evolved with the city-state's dynamic developmental trajectories in the global economy. In the post-Cold War era of global finance, these state-controlled and professionally managed financial investment vehicles are more visible and active in their global expansion and acquisition trails. There are thus significant challenges to their strategic governance and international legitimacy in this new world order. This paper considers some of these challenges in light of recent development in the two SWFs and assesses their organizational and institutional responses to such challenges in today's competitive global economy.

Without a hinterland nor natural resources, the challenges facing the new nation were immense. Labour unrest continued to fester while unemployment remained high. The only solution was to press on with the plan to rapidly industrialise the economy.\n\nWithout Malaysia’s large market, Singapore’s leaders had to think out of the box. Instead of focusing on the domestic market, our leaders switched to an export-oriented strategy. Labour-intensive industries were created to soak up unemployment while we pushed ahead with building infrastructure that would serve industries.\n\nHowever, Singapore’s plans were disrupted by a shock announcement. In 1967, the British announced that it would withdraw its forces from Singapore, which would compromise Singapore’s defence and impact our economy.\n\n[![Image 1: Alt text for image on Isomer site](https://www.sg101.gov.sg/images/economy/case%20study_british%20withdrawal.gif)](https://www.sg101.gov.sg/economy/digging-deeper-case-studies/withdrawal)\n\nThe British withdrawal meant that Singapore had to accelerate its plans for an export-led industralisation strategy. So while some newly independent nations with large domestic markets were adopting protectionist policies – ejecting foreign companies, slashing imports and manufacturing their own products for the domestic market – Singapore had to go against the grain and open our borders to foreign investors.\n\n#### Gaining a Foothold in the Global Market\n\nTo survive, Singapore had to tap on the global market. As then-Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee explained:\n\n![Image 2: Alt text for image on Isomer site](https://www.sg101.gov.sg/images/economy/screenshot%202020-1.png)\n\nThe economic rationale behind the courting of foreign investors was twofold:\n\n1.   First, large foreign companies targeted the global market. They had the necessary expertise and networks that would allow Singapore to quickly scale up these industries. They also had the financial capital to invest in Singapore’s infrastructure. For instance, oil company Shell built Singapore’s first oil refinery at the cost of S$30 million on Pulau Bukom in 1961.\n\n2.   Second, our goal was to eventually enable knowledge transfer from foreign companies to local enterprises. This would enable local companies to acquire the necessary technical expertise to start building local industries in the longer term.\n\nSingapore thus pressed ahead with the export-oriented strategy.\n\nEDB shifted its focus to promoting Singapore as an attractive destination for foreign investment. Its other functions were then transferred to new agencies set up in 1968. For one, initial function of providing financing to companies was hived off to the newly set-up Development Bank of Singapore (DBS). Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) took over the development and management of industrial infrastructure, while EDB’s export promotion division was absorbed by Intraco, a government trading company.\n\nWith that, EDB officers fanned out to foreign markets that included the United States and Japan to persuade big companies such as Texas Instruments, Fairchild and Seiko to set up their production bases in Singapore. EDB prioritised attracting these investments and went the extra mile to ensure that the foreign companies had what they needed.\n\nIn 1968, when National Semiconductor visited Singapore, EDB’s officers found out that there was an urgent need for the company to start production within two months.\n\nEDB worked with other government agencies to quicken this process. Within two weeks of the visit, National Semiconductor was in business here. The speed and efficiency of this operation drew the attention of other American manufacturers. Fairchild came soon after, followed by Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard and General Electric.\n\nTo further boost Singapore’s attraction to foreign investors, the government also created a conducive investment environment.\n\nIn 1967, the Economic Expansion Incentives Act was introduced. It provided new tax incentives for investments. These included tax emeptions and reliefs, such as up to 90% remission of tax profits to approved enterprises for up to 15 years.\n\nThe government also continued to build infrastructure to support Singapore’s industrialisation efforts.\n\nIn 1964, the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) was created to take over the functions of Singapore Harbour Board, which was previously in charge of port operations. In 1971, PSA also took over and converted the former British Naval Base Store Basin into Sembawang Wharves .\n\nIn 1965, as part of the Jurong industrialisation project, we opened Jurong Port, which handled bulk cargo used by industries located in Jurong.\n\nIn 1968, Neptune Orient Lines was established, and this gave Singapore another way to support the economy through fair freight routes.\n\nCommunication services such as postal, telegraph, telephone, and telex services also developed quickly between 1966 and 1973.\n\n#### Focusing on Education and Training\n\nAs Singapore began vocational training in the early 1960s, by 1965 we had a pool of semi-skilled workers who could support the nation’s growing industrialisation. We continued putting emphasis on training and developing human capital to stay relevant.\n\nAs then-Finance Minister Goh explained: ![Image 3: Alt text for image on Isomer site](https://www.sg101.gov.sg/images/economy/screenshot%202020-10-22.png)\n\n#### Quelling Labour Unrest and Communism\n\nAnother key priority for the government was to stamp out the communist elements that were fomenting unrest and dissent. Dr Winsemius described this as a top objective for the government:\n\n![Image 4: Alt text for image on Isomer site](https://www.sg101.gov.sg/images/economy/screenshot%202020-10-22aaadad.png)\n\nThe National Trades Union Congress was founded in 1961, after the communist elements broke away from the PAP. Over the course of three years, NTUC battled with the Singapore Association of Trade Unions for influence over workers. In 1968, the government amended the Industrial Relations Act, which was aimed at reducing the number of strikes in the economy.\n\n![Image 5: Alt text for image on Isomer site](https://www.sg101.gov.sg/images/economy/full_finance_minister_goh_keng_swee.jpg) (Image: [NTUC](http://ms50.ntuc.org.sg/1960s/))\n\nIn 1969, NTUC held the “Modernisation of the Labour Movement” seminar, a forum that looked to build on the new norm in industrial relations. At this seminar, then-PM Lee urged the unions to shed its image as purely as “a combat organisation… for class war,” and move towards acting in the interests of the nation. This formed the foundation of what would later be known as tripartism.\n\nTripartism refers to the collaboration among unions, employers and the government. The goal is for the three parties to work together in a consultative and collaborative fashion to further shared interests.\n\nThe National Wages Council, set up in 1972, is one key manifestation of tripartism. It aims to bring employers, unions and the government to a consensus on wages, an issue that was traditionally damaging to labour relations. Since then, the NWC issues yearly wage guidelines that take into account the interests of all three parties, ensuring compromise instead of confrontation.\n\n![Image 6: Alt text for image on Isomer site](https://www.sg101.gov.sg/images/economy/screenshot%202020-10-28%20at.png) (Image: The introduction of tripartism in Singapore resulted in a marked decrease in the number of work stoppages and man-days lost by 1968; Singapore Year Book 1968; National Archives of Singapore)\n\nAfter the introduction of tripartism, the number of labour strikes decreased from 10 in 1972 to one in 1977. There were none from 1997 to 2012. In this same period, unemployment fell in Singapore and foreign direct investment rose.\n\nToday, tripartism is seen as a key competitive advantage for Singapore. It has been called Singapore’s “secret weapon” for helping to boost the country’s economic competitiveness, promoting harmonious labour-management relations, and contributing to Singapore’s overall progress.\n\nBy 1970, about a decade after the industrialisation plan was first conceived, Singapore had achieved near full employment. Industrial action had dropped significantly. And a spirit of cooperation superseded the disruptions of the preceding years.\n\n[![Image 7: Alt text for image on Isomer site](https://www.sg101.gov.sg/images/economy/more_labour%20movement.gif)](http://ms50.ntuc.org.sg/1960s/)\n",

Singapore ’s economic \n\nactivity is characterised by growth cycles, rather than \n\nclassical cycles or growth rate cycles as it has generally \n\nbeen on an upward trend with relatively stable \n\ngrowths. \n\n## Singapore’s Composite Coincident \n\n## Index and Growth Cycle Chronology \n\nSingapore ’s growth cycle chronology is determined \n\nfrom the growth cycles identified using the composite \n\ncoincident index (CCI). The CCI is an aggregate \n\nof five macroeconomic indicators that move in \n\ntandem with business cycles, thus tracking the \n\nprevailing state of aggregate economic activity \n\n(Table 2). \n\nWith a more complete coverage of the different \n\neconomic processes, the CCI is generally regarded \n\nas a better representation of Singapore ’s overall \n\neconomic activity as compared to any single \n\nmacroeconomic indicator such as real gross domestic \n\nproduct (GDP). \n\nThe latest review in 2023 concluded that the existing \n\nset of composite coincident indicators remains a\n\nreliable representation of Singapore ’s overall economic \n\nactivity. \n\nClassical \n\nCycle \n\nGrowth \n\nCycle \n\nGrowth Rate \n\nCycle \n\nCharacterised by \n\nabsolute \n\nexpansions \n\nand \n\ncontractions \n\nin the levels of \n\naggregate \n\neconomic \n\nactivity \n\ndeviations \n\nfrom the long -\n\nterm trend \n\ngrowth rate of \n\nthe economy \n\nfluctuations in \n\nthe growth \n\nrate of \n\naggregate \n\neconomic \n\nactivity \n\nComposite Coincident Indicators \n\nGross Domestic Product in Chained Dollars \n\nIndex of Industrial Production \n\nNon -Oil Domestic Exports at Constant Prices \n\nTotal Employment \n\nRetail Sales Index Excluding Motor Vehicles in Chained \n\nVolume Terms        \n\n> 1Comprehensive reviews were conducted in 1991, 2004, 2011 and 2023.\n> 2Details on the different types of business cycles can be found in the feature article ‘Singapore ’s Growth Cycle Chronology and Performance of\n> Composite Leading Indicators ’published in the ‘Economic Survey of Singapore 2011’: https:// www.singstat.gov.sg/ -/media/files/publications/economy/\n> leading_indicators .\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTYPES OF BUSINESS CY CLES \n\nTABLE 2 \n\nSINGAPORE COMPOSITE COINCIDENT \n\nINDICATORS 8 Statistics Singapore Newsletter Issue 2, 2023 \n\nDates of Peak and Trough  Average Duration in Months \n\nPeak \n\n(P) \n\nTrough \n\n(T) \n\nPeak \n\n(P) \n\nLow -growth \n\n(P to T) \n\nHigh -growth \n\n(T to P) \n\nFull Cycle \n\n(P to P) \n\nFull Cycle \n\n(T to T) \n\nMay 1974  Dec 1974  Feb 1976  7 14  21  38 \n\nFeb 1976  Feb 1978  May 1981  24  39  63  58 \n\nMay 1981  Dec 1982  Aug 1984  19  20  39  36 \n\nAug 1984  Dec 1985  Jun 1988  16  30  46  46 \n\nJun 1988  Oct 1989  Aug 1990  16  10  26  36 \n\nAug 1990  Oct 1992  Sep 1994  26  23  49  30 \n\nSep 1994  Apr 1995  Jul 1997  7 27  34  43 \n\nJul 1997  Nov 1998  Aug 2000  16  21  37  35 \n\nAug 2000  Oct 2001  Apr 2002  14  6 20  20 \n\nApr 2002  Jun 2003  May 2004  14  11  25  21 \n\nMay 2004  Mar 2005  Mar 2008  10  36  46  55 \n\nMar 2008  Oct 2009  May 2010  19  7 26  36 \n\nMay 2010  Oct 2012  Nov 2014  29  25  54  38 \n\nNov 2014  Dec 2015 P Oct 2019 P 13  46  59  54 \n\nOct 2019 P Jun 2020 P - 8 - - - \n\n> P: Recent peaks/troughs are preliminary as the trend estimates may be revised when more data become available.\n\nCHART 1 SINGAPORE’S GROWTH CYCLES, 20 10 - 2022 \n\nTABLE 3 SINGAPORE’S GROWTH C YCLE CHRONOLOGY, 1974 - 2022 \n\nTable 3 presents Singapore ’s growth cycle chronology \n\nfrom 1974 to 2022. Since its recovery from the Global \n\nFinancial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, the Singapore economy \n\nhas experienced three growth cycles (Chart 1). \n\nFollowing the short -lived seven -month recovery from \n\nthe GFC, Singapore entered its longest period of \n\neconomic slowdown of 29 months since 1974. \n\nThe slowdown was attributed to spill -over effects from \n\nthe European debt crisis to the Asia -Pacific region, \n\nwhich eventually bottomed out in late 2012, after the \n\nannouncement from European Central Bank on its \n\nunlimited support and bailout for affected eurozone \n\nmember states. 9Statistics Singapore Newsletter Issue 2, 2023 \n\nSubsequently, China ’s economic slowdown in 2014 \n\nspilled over to export -dependent Asian economies \n\nsuch as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. \n\nConsequently, Singapore ’s CCI peaked in Nov 2014 \n\nbefore bottoming out in early 2016, amidst an \n\nimprovement in the global macroeconomic \n\nenvironment. Notably, Singapore registered an \n\nimpressive economic expansion lasting 46 months, \n\nfrom Dec 2015 to Oct 2019. \n\nThe most recent cycle was registered in Oct 2019, \n\nwhen Singapore experienced its most severe economic \n\nrecession due to a confluence of factors (including the \n\nUS -China trade war and the COVID -19 pandemic) \n\nwhich affected demand and global supply chains. \n\nFortunately, the acute fall in overall economic activity \n\nlasted only 8 months. By Jun 2020, Singapore ’s\n\neconomy embarked on its recovery phase. \n\n## Growth Cycle Recessions versus \n\n## Technical Recessions \n\nGrowth cycle recessions are defined as the periods \n\nof economic downturns registered during every \n\npeak -trough phase identified by the growth cycle. \n\nThis is distinct from technical recessions which \n\nare defined as two consecutive periods of \n\nquarter -on -quarter (q -o-q) declines of the seasonally \n\nadjusted (SA) real GDP. \n\nFor example, while Singapore experienced three \n\ngrowth cycle recessions since 2010, the Singapore \n\neconomy only slipped into a technical recession \n\nin the second quarter of 2020, following two \n\nconsecutive quarters of decline in the SA real GDP \n\n(Chart 2). \n\nCHART 2 SINGAPORE’S GROWTH CYCLES WITH SEASONALLY ADJUSTED \n\nQUARTER -ON -QUARTER REAL GDP, 20 10 - 2022 10  Statistics Singapore Newsletter Issue 2, 2023 \n\n## Singapore’s Composite Leading Index \n\nThe composite leading index (CLI) is a predictive tool \n\nto gauge if, and approximately when, an economic \n\nexpansion or recession will take place. It serves as \n\na useful forewarning tool for economists and \n\npolicymakers on the overall health of the economy. \n\nCLIs have been compiled by many countries, \n\ne.g., Netherlands, Japan, Korea and Malaysia, and \n\ninternational organisations such as The Conference \n\nBoard and the Organisation for Economic \n\nCo -operation and Development (OECD), with a view \n\nto anticipate upturns and downturns in the economy. \n\nSingapore ’s CLI comprises nine economic indicators \n\nthat exhibit leading relationships with the growth \n\ncycles of the economy (Table 4). These leading \n\nindicators have been selected based on a set of key \n\ncriteria including economic significance, cyclical \n\nproperties, timeliness, periodicity and statistical quality \n\nof the data series. \n\nThe latest review in 2023 suggests that the existing set \n\nof composite leading indicators remains relevant in \n\nidentifying and anticipating Singapore ’s growth cycles. \n\nIn the previous comprehensive review conducted in \n\n2011, Singapore ’s CLI had an average lead of \n\n4.8 months over the CCI for the period of 2003 to \n\n2010. Based on the latest review, Singapore ’s CLI \n\nmaintained its lead over CCI, with an average \n\nlead of 5.0 months for the period of 2010 to 2022 \n\n(Table 5). \n\nFor example, the CLI peaked 3 months before the \n\neconomic slowdown in May 2010 and bottomed out \n\n13 months before the subsequent recovery. \n\n## Conclusion \n\nThe latest comprehensive review in 2023 indicates that \n\nthe existing CCI remains an adequate and reliable \n\nrepresentation of Singapore ’s prevailing aggregate \n\neconomic activity. \n\nFindings from the review also suggest the continuing \n\nrelevance of the existing CLI in identifying and \n\nanticipating Singapore ’s growth cycles. The results \n\nfurther show that the leading properties of the CLI has \n\nimproved marginally for the period of 2010 to 2022, \n\ncompared with 2003 to 2010. \n\nMore information and latest data on CLI are available \n\nfrom the information paper ‘Singapore ’s Growth Cycle \n\nChronology, Coincident and Leading Indicators ’ and on \n\nthe  SingStat Table Builder .\n\nComposite Leading Indicators \n\nTotal New Companies Formed \n\nMoney Supply (M2) \n\nStock Exchange of Singapore Indices \n\nBusiness Expectations for Stock of Finished Goods \n\n(Manufacturing) \n\nBusiness Expectations for Wholesale Trade \n\nUS Purchasing Managers’ Index (Manufacturing) \n\nTotal Non -Oil Seaborne Cargo Handled \n\nDomestic Liquidity Indicator \n\nTotal Non -Oil Retained Imports at Constant Prices \n\nTABLE 4 \n\nSINGAPORE COMPOSITE LEADING INDICATORS \n\nTABLE 5 \n\nLEADS AND LAGS OF TH E CLI OVER THE CCI, \n\n20 10 - 2022 \n\nGrowth \n\nCycle \n\nCCI \n\nTurning \n\nPoints \n\nCLI \n\nTurning \n\nPoints \n\nLead[+]/ \n\nLag[ -]\n\n(Months) \n\nPeak  May 20 10 Feb 20 10 + 3 \n\nTrough  Oct 20 12 Sep 20 11  + 13\n\nPeak  Nov 20 14 Apr 20 14 + 7 \n\nTrough  Dec 20 15 Dec 20 15 0\n\nPeak*  Oct 20 19 - -\n\nTrough  Jun 2020  Apr 2020  + 2 \n\nAverage (20 10-2022)  + 5\n",

The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced today that \n\nSingapore’s GDP growth forecast for 2025 has been upgraded from “0.0 to 2.0 per cent” to “1.5 to 2.5 per cent”. This largely reflects the better-than-expected performance of the Singapore economy in the first half of 2025. However, the economic outlook for the rest of the year remains clouded by uncertainty, with the risks tilted to the downside. \n\nEconomic Performance in Second Quarter 2025 \n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, the Singapore economy grew by 4.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis, extending the 4.1 per cent growth in the previous quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the Singapore economy expanded by 1.4 per cent, a reversal from the 0.5 per cent contraction in the first quarter . For the first half of 2025, Singapore’s GDP growth came in at 4.3 per cent year-on-year. \n\nOn a year-on-year basis, GDP growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by the wholesale trade, manufacturing, finance & insurance, and transportation & storage sectors. In turn, the wholesale trade and transportation & storage sectors were boosted by front-loading activities in the region ahead of the implementation of tariff measures by the US. On the other hand, the food & beverage services sector shrank, due in part to a sustained increase in outbound travel by locals. \n\n[Refer to Annex A for the economic performance of the various sectors.]         \n\n> 3.4\n> 5.7\n> 5.0\n> 4.1 4.4\n> 1.8\n> 4.4\n> 1.5 - 2.5\n> 0.0\n> 1.0\n> 2.0\n> 3.0\n> 4.0\n> 5.0\n> 6.0\n> 7.0\n> 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24 1Q25 2Q25 2023 2024 2025f\n> YoY % change\n\nSingapore's Real GDP Growth \n\n> Full-Year Growth (%)\n\n2\n\nEconomic Outlook for 2025 \n\nMTI maintained the GDP growth forecast at “0.0 to 2.0 per cent” in May, in view of the potential impact of the sweeping tariffs announced in April on major economies. \n\nSince then, the performance of most advanced and regional economies has been more resilient than expected as the US’ 90-day pause on its reciprocal tariffs 1 postponed the potential negative economic impact, while front-loading activities during the tariff pause provided a temporary boost to production and exports. There has also been a de-escalation in trade tensions, with the US striking trade deals with several trading partners, including  the Eurozone, Japan, South Korea and several Southeast Asian economies, that led to a lowering of their reciprocal tariffs compared to that announced earlier. 2 Meanwhile, the US and China continue to be engaged in trade talks, with indications that the 90-day tariff truce between the two countries could be extended. 3\n\nConsequently, the 2025 GDP growth of the key economies,  including the US, Eurozone and China,  is not expected to be as weak as earlier projected. Accordingly, MTI has updated its assessment of the overall external outlook for Singapore. \n\nLooking ahead, the growth of Singapore’s major trading partners in the second half of the year is expected to moderate from that in the first half, as the boost from front-loading activities dissipates and the US’ reciprocal tariffs take effect. In the US, GDP \n\ngrowth is projected to weaken for the rest of the year amidst signs of a cooling labour market and as upward price pressures from tariff hikes dampen consumer spending. Meanwhile, the Eurozone could see  a pullback in exports and hence GDP growth  as the \n\nUS’ reciprocal and sectoral tariffs come into effect in the latter half of 2025 . Even so, \n\neasing trade tensions with the US could lift economic sentiments, and alongside lower inflation and accommodative monetary policy, provide some support to domestic demand. \n\nIn Asia, China’s GDP growth is also projected to ease over the course of the year on \n\naccount of weaker exports growth as global trade activity turns more subdued with the implementation of the US’ tariff measures. On the other hand, domestic consumption and investment growth are expected to remain firm, supported by policy measures. The GDP growth of key Southeast Asian economies is similarly expected to moderate in the    \n\n> 1On 9 April 2025, the US implemented a 90-day pause on its reciprocal tariffs until 9 July 2025. The pause was later extended to 1 August 2025.\n> 2On 31 July 2025, the US announced a revised set of reciprocal tariffs that accounted for the trade deals struck, in addition to reaffirming that baseline tariffs of 10 per cent would continue to be imposed on countries not subjected to the reciprocal tariffs. The reciprocal tariffs have since come into effect on 7 August 2025.\n> 3During the 90-day truce from 14 May to 12 August 2025, the US’ tariff on China is lowered from 145 per cent to 30 per cent, and China’s retaliatory tariff on the US is reduced from 125 per cent to 10 per cent. The US and China held further negotiations in Stockholm on 28 and 29 July 2025 to discuss an extension of the tariff truce, among other trade issues. 3\n\nsecond half of 2025 due to the impact of the US’ reciprocal tariffs on their exports and as domestic demand softens in some economies. \n\nMore importantly, significant uncertainties remain in the global economy due in part to the continued unpredictability of the US’ trade policies, including the timing and extent of the sectoral tariffs on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Overall, the balance of risks in the global economy is skewed to the downside. First, a re-escalation \n\nof tariff actions could lead to a renewed spike in economic uncertainty, and cause businesses and households to pull back sharply on spending and hiring. Second, a shock \n\nto financial markets resulting from a sharper-than-expected tightening of global \n\nfinancial conditions could lead to destabilising capital flows that trigger latent \n\nvulnerabilities in banking and financial systems. Third, potential escalations in \n\ngeopolitical tensions could lead to supply disruptions in energy commodities and renewed pressures on global energy prices. \n\nAgainst this backdrop , Singapore’s economic growth is expected to slow in the second half of the year compared to the first half because of slower growth in outward-oriented sectors. In particular, the pace of growth in the manufacturing sector is projected to weaken in the coming quarters as the US’ tariff measures weigh on demand in global end-markets. Nevertheless, there remain some bright spots within the sector, namely the transport engineering cluster given the sustained shift towards higher value-added aircraft maintenance, repair & overhaul works in Singapore, as well as the precision engineering cluster due to the continued ramp-up in capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers producing AI-related semiconductors. \n\nGrowth in the wholesale trade sector is similarly expected to slow for the rest of 2025 as the lift from front-loading activities in the region wanes and global trade softens. These factors will also weigh on the transportation & storage sector through their drag on the demand for shipping and air cargo services. \n\nMeanwhile, growth in the finance & insurance sector is likely to be dampened by weaker credit demand and lower payment transaction volumes due to fragile business confidence and tepid consumer spending. Nonetheless, bullish market sentiment could keep trading activity buoyant and provide some upsides to growth. \n\nFinally, growth in consumer-facing sectors such as retail trade and food & beverage services is likely to remain lacklustre for the rest of the year, weighed down by the continued shift in locals’ spending abroad and the projected weakening of domestic labour market conditions. \n\nGiven the better-than-expected performance of the Singapore economy in the first half of the year, and considering the projected softening of both the global and domestic 4\n\neconomies in the second half of the year, MTI has upgraded Singapore’s GDP growth forecast for 2025 from  “0.0 to 2.0 per cent”  to “1.5 to 2.5 per cent” . However, Singapore’s economic outlook for the rest of the year remains clouded by uncertainty, with the risks tilted to the downside. 4 MTI will continue to monitor developments in the global and domestic economies closely, and make adjustments to the forecast if necessary over the course of the year. \n\nMINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY \n\n12 August 2025  \n\n> 4\n\nLeading indicators point to early signs of slowing momentum and weakening sentiments in the economy. For instance, DOS’ composite leading index fell by 0.5 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the second quarter of 2025, a pullback from the 1.2 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index turned slightly contractionary in July, driven by declines in the new orders, production and employment sub-indices. MOM’s hiring and wage expectations survey indicates softening sentiments, with the proportion of firms in June expecting to hire in the next three months edging down to 43.7 per cent, from 44.0 per cent in March. Similarly, the proportion of firms expecting to raise wages in the next three months fell to 22.4 per cent, from 24.4 per cent over the same period. 5\n\nANNEX A \n\nEconomic Performance by Sectors in Second Quarter 2025 \n\nThe manufacturing sector expanded by 5.2 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, \n\nfollowing the 4.7 per cent growth in the previous quarter. Growth during the quarter was driven by output expansions across all clusters except for the chemicals and general manufacturing clusters. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector shrank by 0.4 per cent, extending the 5.2 per cent contraction in the preceding quarter. \n\nGrowth in the construction sector came in at 6.0 per cent year-on-year, faster than the \n\n4.9 per cent expansion in the first quarter. Growth during the quarter was supported by expansions in both public sector and private sector construction output. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector grew by 5.7 per cent, a reversal from the 2.0 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. \n\nThe wholesale trade sector grew by 4.7 per cent year-on-year, picking up from the 4.0 \n\nper cent growth in the preceding quarter. Growth of the sector was led by the machinery, equipment & supplies segment on the back of robust growth in the wholesale volumes of electronic components and telecommunications & computers. At the same time, the fuels & chemicals segment expanded on account of an increase in the wholesale sales of petroleum & petroleum products. The “others” 5 segment similarly posted growth during the quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector grew by 2.8 per cent, a turnaround from the 0.5 per cent contraction in the first quarter. \n\nThe retail trade sector recorded growth of 0.7 per cent year-on-year, extending the 0.3 \n\nper cent expansion in the previous quarter. Growth during the quarter was supported by an increase in motor vehicular sales volumes which outweighed a decline in non-motor vehicular sales volumes. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector shrank by 1.4 per cent, a reversal from the 2.0 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. \n\nGrowth in the transportation & storage sector slowed to 5.1 per cent year-on-year, from \n\n6.2 per cent in the first quarter. Within the sector, the air transport segment continued to expand, with the total number of air passengers handled at Changi Airport during the quarter growing on a year-on-year basis. Meanwhile, the water transport segment also registered growth, supported by an increase in container throughput, which more than offset a decline in sea cargo handled at Singapore’s ports. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector grew by 0.7 per cent, moderating from the 3.9 per cent expansion in the previous quarter.  \n\n> 5The “others” segment comprises a diverse range of products including metals, timber & construction materials, household equipment & furniture as well as food, beverages & tobacco, among others.\n\n6\n\nThe accommodation sector grew by 2.4 per cent year-on-year, a turnaround from the \n\n1.1 per cent contraction in the preceding quarter. Growth of the sector came on the back of an increase in total gross lettings over the same period, which was in turn led by higher gross lettings in the luxury and mid-tier hotel segments. By contrast, gross lettings in the upscale hotel segment declined. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector expanded by 1.1 per cent, a reversal from the 1.0 per cent contraction in the first quarter. \n\nThe food & beverage services sector shrank by 0.5 per cent year-on-year, extending the \n\n0.7 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. The weak performance of the sector during the quarter was due to a fall in sales volumes at restaurants and fast-food outlets, which more than offset an increase in sales volumes at food caterers and cafes, food courts & other eating places. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector contracted by 0.7 per cent, extending the 0.6 per cent decline in the preceding quarter. \n\nGrowth in the information & communications sector eased to 4.2 per cent year-on-year, \n\nfrom 4.8 per cent in the first quarter. The sector’s growth during the quarter was primarily driven by expansions in the IT & information services and “others” 6 segments, \n\nwith the former supported by data hosting and internet search engine activities, and the latter by games publishing activities . On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector grew by 3.1 per cent, reversing the 3.0 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. \n\nThe finance & insurance sector expanded by 4.2 per cent year-on-year, extending the \n\n4.1 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. Growth was largely supported by the banking and activities auxiliary to financial services segments. The former grew as net fees and commissions continued to increase by double-digits, albeit less strongly when compared to the first quarter likely due in part to tepid investment banking activity amidst heightened macroeconomic uncertainty. Meanwhile, growth in the latter, which comprises mainly the payments players, likely reflected an increase in cross-border transactions alongside a pickup in global trade activity. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector shrank marginally by 0.1 per cent, moderating from the 1.4 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. \n\nThe real estate sector grew by 5.2 per cent year-on-year, slower than the 7.5 per cent \n\nexpansion in the first quarter. Growth of the sector was largely supported by the private residential property segment. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the  \n\n> 6The “others” segment consists of (i) publishing activities (including computer games and software publishing), (ii) motion picture, video and other programme production, sound recording, and music publishing activities, and (iii) radio and television broadcasting activities. 7\n\nsector posted a contraction of 1.8 per cent, a pullback from the 4.6 per cent expansion in the preceding quarter. \n\nThe professional services sector expanded by 3.3 per cent year-on-year, faster than the \n\n1.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter. Growth was mainly driven by expansions in the head offices & business representative offices and other professional, scientific & technical services segments. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector recorded slower growth of 0.6 per cent compared to the 1.1 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. \n\nThe administrative & support services sector grew by 2.6 per cent year-on-year, \n\nextending the 2.1 per cent growth in the first quarter. Growth during the quarter was led by expansions in the rental & leasing, security & cleaning services and other business support services segments. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sector expanded by 1.0 per cent, moderating from the 2.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter. \n\nThe “other services industries” expanded by 4.4 per cent year-on-year, accelerating \n\nfrom the 1.6 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. Growth during the quarter was \n\nlargely driven by the arts, entertainment & recreation and health & social services sectors.  On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the “other services industries” grew by 2.4 per cent, improving from the 0.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter. 8\n\nANNEX B \n\nREAL SECTORAL GROWTH RATES \n\n2Q24  3Q24  4Q24  2024  1Q25  2Q25 \n\nYear -on -Year % Change \n\nTotal  3.4  5.7  5.0  4.4  4.1  4.4 \n\nGoods Producing Industries  0.7  9.8  6.5  4.2  4.5  5.0 \n\nManufacturing  -0.6  11.2  7.4  4.3  4.7  5.2 \n\nConstruction  5.8  5.6  4.4  4.5  4.9  6.0 \n\nServices Producing Industries  4.1  4.4  4.6  4.4  3.8  4.3 \n\nWholesale Trade  4.9  6.0  6.7  5.1  4.0  4.7 \n\nRetail Trade  -2.2  -0.7  -1.0  -0.4  0.3  0.7 \n\nTransportation & Storage  5.4  7.9  3.7  5.8  6.2  5.1 \n\nAccommodation  4.4  5.6  4.2  7.1  -1.1  2.4 \n\nFood & Beverage Services  -2.2  -1.3  -0.3  -0.9  -0.7  -0.5 \n\nInformation & Communications  6.0  4.0  4.2  5.0  4.8  4.2 \n\nFinance & Insurance  7.4  5.6  6.1  6.8  4.1  4.2 \n\nReal Estate  -2.6  1.0  3.5  0.2  7.5  5.2 \n\nProfessional Services  1.8  1.2  0.6  1.2  1.9  3.3 \n\nAdministrative & Support Services  1.5  1.1  -0.6  0.5  2.1  2.6 \n\nOther Services Industries  2.8  2.0  3.1  3.0  1.6  4.4 \n\nPublic Administration & Defence  0.1  0.7  1.1  0.6  0.0  0.1 \n\nEducation  2.0  2.6  1.5  1.9  1.3  1.5 \n\nHealth & Social Services  4.5  5.7  6.2  5.0  5.4  6.0 \n\nArts, Entertainment & Recreation  4.6  -8.3  4.3  5.9  -3.6  22.5 \n\nOther Services - Others  4.8  3.9  3.0  4.3  2.5  2.6 \n\nSeasonally Adjusted Quarter -on -Quarter Growth % \n\nTotal  1.1  3.0  0.5  4.4  -0.5  1.4 \n\nGoods Producing Industries  0.2  9.0  0.0  4.2  -4.2  0.7 \n\nManufacturing  -0.9  11.7  0.0  4.3  -5.2  -0.4 \n\nConstruction  5.1  1.9  0.3  4.5  -2.0  5.7 \n\nServices Producing Industries  1.0  1.2  0.9  4.4  0.6  1.5 \n\nWholesale Trade  2.3  1.3  0.9  5.1  -0.5  2.8 \n\nRetail Trade  -1.9  1.3  -1.2  -0.4  2.0  -1.4 \n\nTransportation & Storage  2.1  1.5  -1.2  5.8  3.9  0.7 \n\nAccommodation  -3.0  2.4  -0.2  7.1  -1.0  1.1 \n\nFood & Beverage Services  -0.9  0.8  0.1  -0.9  -0.6  -0.7 \n\nInformation & Communications  3.8  1.8  2.4  5.0  -3.0  3.1 \n\nFinance & Insurance  -0.1  0.5  5.3  6.8  -1.4  -0.1 \n\nReal Estate  0.5  1.2  1.1  0.2  4.6  -1.8 \n\nProfessional Services  -1.1  1.5  0.3  1.2  1.1  0.6 \n\nAdministrative & Support Services  0.5  -0.2  -1.1  0.5  2.9  1.0 \n\nOther Services Industries  -0.4  0.6  1.4  3.0  0.0  2.4 \n\nPublic Administration & Defence  0.0  0.5  0.3  0.6  -0.8  0.1 \n\nEducation  0.3  1.3  -0.5  1.9  0.2  0.6 \n\nHealth & Social Services  2.5  1.5  1.2  5.0  0.1  3.0 \n\nArts, Entertainment & Recreation  -22.4  0.5  16.1  5.9  6.5  -1.4 \n\nOther Services - Others  0.1  -1.0  2.7  4.3  0.8  0.1 9\n\nOTHER ECONOMIC INDICATORS \n\n2Q24  3Q24  4Q24  2024  1Q25  2Q25 \n\nRetail Sales Index * (yoy, %)  -1.5  -0.3  -0.8  0.0  0.5  1.5 \n\nChanges in Employment (’000)  14.9  24.9  11.9  59.8  6.9  10.8 \n\nUnemployment Rate, SA (%)  1.9  1.9  1.9  2.0  2.0  2.1 \n\nValue Added Per Actual Hour Worked^ (yoy, %)  4.0  4.5  3.3  3.6  4.0  1.7 \n\nValue Added Per Worker^ (yoy, %)  1.9  4.2  3.5  2.7  2.6  3.0 \n\nOverall Unit Labour Cost (yoy, %)  1.5  -0.4  1.0  1.2  0.3  -0.7 \n\nUnit Business Cost of Manufacturing (yoy, %)  5.2  -5.9  -2.4  0.2  -0.3  -1.2 \n\nFixed Asset Investments ($ bil)  3.7  1.0  7.0  13.5  1.7  4.0 \n\nConsumer Price Index (yoy, %)  2.8  2.2  1.4  2.4  1.0  0.8 \n\nTotal Merchandise Trade (yoy, %)  9.9  5.3  6.8  6.6  4.8  7.1 \n\nMerchandise Exports  7.5  5.7  5.1  5.7  3.6  11.7 \n\nDomestic Exports  2.9  5.4  -6.0  0.5  -1.9  -4.3 \n\nOil  19.0  -0.2  -17.9  1.0  -9.2  -19.6 \n\nNon -Oil  -6.5  9.0  2.4  0.2  3.3  7.1 \n\nRe -exports  11.5  5.9  13.9  9.8  7.8  24.2 \n\nMerchandise Imports  12.5  5.0  8.7  7.8  6.2  2.2 \n\nTotal Services Trade (yoy, %)  7.9  10.8  7.4  8.6  3.8  1.7 \n\nExports of Services  9.2  12.0  8.4  9.9  4. 4 2.7 \n\nImports of Services  6.5  9.5  6.4  7.1  3. 2 0.6  \n\n> *\n\nIn chained volume terms.  \n\n> ^\n\nBased on GDP at market prices in chained (2015) dollars.\n",

Singapore has extremely high levels of state ownership and the \n\ngovernment has also intervened significantly and strategically in the economy. \n\nThis case study will shine a spotlight on four often-downplayed factors underpinning Singapore’s success, \n\nwhich demonstrate that it is possible to deliver very impressive economic results using a different mix of \n\npolicy tools.  \n\n> 1Turnbull, C.M.

Most analysis of Singapore’s economic success focuses on \n\nits openness to trade and investment, particularly foreign direct \n\ninvestment. It is consistently ranked as one of the ‘freest’ economies \n\nin the world, taking the number one spot in the Heritage Foundation’s \n\n2024 Index of Economic Freedom and 2nd place in the World Bank’s \n\nEase of Doing Business rankings. Singapore’s reputation – certainly in \n\nmuch of the media – is as a free trading, low-taxation, low-regulation \n\nhaven for multinational businesses. \n\nThis reputation is part truth, but a big part myth. Although some \n\ncommentators (grudgingly) acknowledge the ‘paradox’ of Singapore’s \n\nmix of free market and state intervention 3, there is still little \n\nunderstanding of the significant role that the state, and in particular \n\nstate-ownership, has played and continues to play, in Singapore’s \n\neconomic success. \n\nNEGLECTED FACTORS IN SINGAPORE’S \n\nECONOMIC SUCCESS \n\nSingapore has one of the largest SOE sectors \n\nin the world \n\nHaving been considered essential economic policy tools in the \n\nimmediate post-Second World War era, from the 1970’s onwards \n\nSOEs fell out of favour with the economics profession. There was \n\na growing assumption that they are inefficient, a burden on the \n\nstate and vehicles of patronage. In response, and following advice \n\nof the multilateral donors, the 1980s saw waves of closures and \n\nprivatisations. 4\n\nSingapore bucks this trend. It is one of the most advanced economies \n\nin the world, yet its rapid growth was based significantly on its \n\nSOEs, and they continue to play an important role in the country’s \n\neconomy today. Singapore’s SOE sector is primarily made up of \n\nGovernment-Linked Companies (GLC’s) which are entities in which \n\nthe wholly government-owned Temasek Holdings has a controlling \n\nshare. Historically Singapore’s SOE sector has been larger than other \n\ncountries. A 1995 World Bank report found that the weighted average \n\nshare of the SOE sector in GDP in the 40 developing countries it \n\nstudied was 10.7% between 1978-1991. The Singapore Department of \n\nStatistics estimated that GLC’s accounted for 12.9% of GDP in 1998, \n\nwith the non-GLC public sector accounting for another 8.9%, giving \n\na total public sector/GLC share of 21.8%. 5 As of 2024, Temasek’s \n\nSingapore-headquartered portfolio had a net value of US$ 152 billion 6\n\nequivalent to 30.5% of GDP, while in 2019 Temasek had directly or \n\nindirectly, significant stakes in 25 Singaporean listed companies which \n\ncomprised approximately 30% of the total Singaporean stock market \n\ncapitalization. 7\n\nTemasek’s stake in Singapore companies \n\nCompany \n\nname  Sector \n\n% Temasek \n\nshareholding \n\nas of \n\n31 March 2024 \n\nSingapore \n\nPower Ltd \n\nElectricity and \n\ngas  100% \n\nPSA \n\nInternational  Ports  100% \n\nSMRT  Rail, bus & taxi \n\nservices  100% \n\nMandai Park \n\nHoldings Pte Ltd  Wildlife reserve  100% \n\nCapitaLand  Real Estate  100% \n\nSingapore \n\nTechnologies \n\nTelemedia \n\nPte Ltd \n\nTelecommun-\n\nications, media \n\n& technology \n\n100% \n\nSingapore \n\nAirlines  Transport  53% \n\nOlam Group Ltd  Agri-food  52% \n\nSingapore \n\nTelecommun-\n\nications Ltd \n\nTelecommun-\n\nications  51% \n\nSingapore \n\nTechnologies \n\nEngineering Ltd \n\nIndustrial  51% \n\nSeatrium Ltd  Marine \n\nengineering  36% \n\nDBS Group \n\nHoldings Ltd \n\nFinancial \n\nServices  29% \n\nSOURCE: Temasek website \n\nSOEs were a deliberate part of Singapore’s economic development \n\nstrategy and that continues to this day. There are various reasons \n\nfor this, including their usefulness as a tool for a developmental state \n\nfocused on creating jobs and developing a range of hard and soft \n\ninfrastructure and capabilities, as well as the counterweight they \n\nprovided to the foreign multinationals that the government was keen \n\nto attract. Even now when there are GLC privatisations, these tend \n\nto signify a shift within the portfolio - for example the state may take \n\ncontrol in a higher technology industry within the same sector - rather \n\nthan a change in the overall economic mix. \n\nWhy this matters \n\n- The size and longevity of Singapore’s SOE sector demonstrates that \n\nsuch enterprises can be efficient and highly profitable. \n\n- The diversity of sectors in which Singapore’s SOEs are successful – \n\nincluding not just the ‘usual suspects’ of energy and infrastructure, \n\nbut also services such as banking as well as agrifood and \n\nmanufacturing - shows there are many ways SOEs can play a \n\nuseful role in economic development beyond natural monopolies \n\nand market failures. \n\n- The continued economic role of Singapore’s SOEs demonstrates \n\nthat - contrary to popular opinion which suggests that SOEs are \n\nonly relevant to countries who are ‘catching up’ - there can be an \n\nimportant role for SOEs in even the most advanced economies. 8   \n\n> 3In his Inaugural lecture at the Singapore Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in 1980, free-market economist Milton Friedman said “Singapore has promoted a free market.

The 1967 Land \n\nAcquisition Act provided the government with the legal framework \n\nto compulsorily purchase land at market prices. In the late 1960s 44% \n\npercent of Singapore’s land was government-owned, today that figure \n\nis 90%.  This has enabled government to make land available cheaply so \n\nthat the various public agencies could develop industrial zones, build \n\ntransport infrastructure and provide affordable housing for citizens. \n\nToday just under 80% of Singapore’s residents live in state-designed \n\nand maintained Housing Development Board flats which they lease \n\nfrom the government 9 and thanks to government investment in \n\ntransport infrastructure coupled with subsidises which amount to \n\naround 30 per cent of public costs, Singapore has the second most \n\naffordable public transport of comparable global cities. 10 \n\nWhy this matters \n\nSingapore’s strategic use of its limited and valuable land resource to \n\nserve wider societal and national economic objectives, has been an \n\nimportant factor in its success. 11  The ability to use state-owned land \n\nto plan industrial zones has contributed to Singapore’s economic \n\ngrowth and diversification. The provision of affordable housing and \n\npublic transport has contributed to social peace as well as the wealth \n\nof Singapore’s citizens compared to other countries where these every \n\nday necessities eat significantly into wages. For example, a recent study \n\nfound that a low-income worker in South Africa can spend as much as \n\n57% of their net wage on transport, compared to just 10% for a low-\n\nincome worker in Vietnam. Provision of safe and affordable housing is \n\na huge challenge in all countries around the world. In prioritising state \n\nownership of land, Singapore has effectively managed this stress point, \n\nwhile also providing labourers with a supply of affordable housing which \n\nhas helped to support industrialisation efforts. \n\nThe state intervenes a lot in \n\nSingapore’s economy \n\nContrary to common perceptions of Singapore as a country that has \n\ncreated a successful, advanced economy through the free market \n\nalone, the state has been very important in Singapore’s development. \n\nAs well as the GLCs and public land ownership/housing provision, a \n\nwide range of policy levers have been used at different times, in order \n\nto deliver the government’s objectives. \n\n- The state achieved high levels of private savings by mandating \n\ncompulsory contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF). \n\nBetween 1974 and 1984, the CPF’s share of total private savings \n\nrose from 27% to 46%. By 1984, Singapore’s savings rate, at \n\n42% of GDP, was the highest in the world. 12  This enabled the \n\ngovernment to finance large-scale public investments. \n\nSingapore continues to strengthen its \n\nadvanced manufacturing sector. Despite \n\nSingapore’s limited land area, manufacturing \n\nplays a substantial role in the economy, \n\ncontributing nearly 20 per cent to gross \n\ndomestic product (GDP) and employing over \n\n12 per cent of the workforce in 2023 \n\nSingapore Economic Development Board 2024 \n\n- Singapore issues debt strategically to support specific long-term \n\nobjectives, including to finance nationally significant infrastructure. \n\nIt has one of the highest gross debt to GDP ratios of any country in \n\nthe world. According to IMF figures, Singapore’s gross debt is 175.8% \n\nof GDP, third only to Japan (248.7%) and Sudan (237.1%) and much \n\nhigher than the US (124.1%), France (115.3%), Ghana (79.5%) \n\nor Argentina (78.5%). \n\n- Singapore’s well-known success in attracting Foreign Direct \n\nInvestment (FDI as a share of GDP increased from 6.4% in the 1970s \n\nto 16.9% in the 2000s to 34.9% in 2023. 13 ) has been made possible, \n\nnot only by tax breaks and light regulation, but also by significant \n\ngovernment investment in targeted education programmes and the \n\npublic provision of cheap and efficient infrastructure. \n\n- Singapore’s early development and industrialisation efforts were \n\nfinanced by the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS). Although \n\nits role has expanded in recent years to include a wider portfolio \n\nof banking and financial services, DBS was originally established \n\nin 1968 (with advice from Germany’s KfW) to finance Singapore’s \n\nindustrialisation and urban development projects. DBS Bank is now \n\nthe largest bank in Southeast Asia with assets of $540 billion and \n\nTemasek retains a 29% shareholding. 14 \n\nWhy this matters \n\nThis demonstrates an important and often over-looked paradox – that \n\nstate ownership is not intrinsically inward-looking or inefficient but can \n\n(and in Singapore’s case has) play an important role in delivering open, \n\nexport-oriented, FDI-friendly and highly successful economies. \n\n# 2\n\n# 3\n\nSINGAPORE’S COMMITMENT TO \n\nMANUFACTURING \n\nEvidence of the importance of manufacturing to Singapore \n\ncan be found on the S$10,000 bank note – the highest value \n\nbank note in the world. It features on its reverse side images \n\nof a silicon wafer, a microprocessor and partial sequences of \n\ntwo proteins.    \n\n> 9Singapore Housing and Development Board\n> 10 Budget Direct Insurance (2019) ” Public Transport Singapore ” and Li, M. & Reza, S.\n> “International Benchmarking Study of Public Transport Fares” Nanyang Business School\n> 11 Mazzucato, M. and Farha, L.

From a peak of around 32% in the early \n\n1970’s, manufacturing has consistently contributed on average 24-26% \n\nof Singapore’s GDP over the last two decades and employment in the \n\nmanufacturing sector has continued to grow (albeit at a slower pace \n\nthan employment in the services sector). 15  Singapore is currently the \n\n14th largest exporter of goods by value in the world with an average \n\nannual growth in exports between 2019 and 2023 of seven per cent. 16 \n\nThis has been a result of a deliberate government strategy. \n\nFollowing independence Singapore was keen to develop a solid \n\nmanufacturing base. Early industries were supported on the basis \n\nof their job creation potential and included producing matchsticks, \n\nplastic toothbrushes, zips and chewing gum. By the end of 1969, \n\nwhen unemployment had fallen to 6.5%, the focus shifted from \n\nbasic consumer goods towards higher value-added production, \n\nsupported by the interest and technology of a growing number \n\nof foreign investors. Government supported this process through \n\nproviding specialised advanced training centres, developing a 10-point \n\nprogramme to develop advanced manufacturing and providing tax \n\nholidays for firms according to the share of technical personnel in the \n\ncompany’s workforce. 17  Today Singapore is the fourth largest global \n\nexporter of high-technology products, including integrated circuits, \n\nsmart phones, semi-conductors and chemicals and its unemployment \n\nrate is under two per cent. 18 \n\nWhy this matters \n\nMany small economies, particularly low-income small island states \n\nand land-locked economies have been advised not to pursue \n\nmanufacturing, but rather to concentrate on developing their \n\nservice sectors. The experience of Singapore demonstrates that \n\neven very small states without a large internal market, can develop \n\nhighly sophisticated manufacturing capabilities that contribute \n\nto diversification and mitigate the risks associated with a small \n\neconomy’s concentrated production and export structure, while \n\nalso delivering skilled jobs, contributing to foreign exchange earnings \n\nand creating important linkages to other parts of the economy. 20 \n\n# 4 FURTHER READING \n\nChang, H.

Today, it is one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Its GDP per capita has risen to an incredible U.S. $60,000, making it one of the strongest economies in the world. For a small country with few natural resources, Singapore's economic ascension is nothing short of remarkable. By embracing globalization, free-market capitalism, education, and pragmatic policies, the country has been able to overcome its geographic disadvantages and become a leader in global commerce.\n\nGaining Independence\n--------------------\n\nFor over 100 years, Singapore was under British control. But when the British failed to protect the colony from the Japanese during [World War II](https://www.thoughtco.com/world-war-ii-4133274), it sparked a strong anti-colonial and nationalist sentiment that subsequently led to Singapore's independence.\n\nOn August 31, 1963, [Singapore seceded from the British crown](https://www.thoughtco.com/faq-about-singapore-195082) and merged with Malaysia to form the Federation of Malaysia. The two years Singapore spent as part of Malaysia were filled with social strife, as the two sides struggled to assimilate with one another ethnically. Street riots and violence became very common. The Chinese in Singapore outnumbered the Malay three-to-one. The Malay politicians in Kuala Lumpur feared their heritage and political ideologies were being threatened by the growing Chinese population throughout the island and peninsula. Therefore, as a way of ensuring a Malay majority within [Malaysia](https://www.thoughtco.com/malaysia-facts-and-history-195593) proper and to limit the influence of communism, the Malaysian parliament voted to expel Singapore from Malaysia. Singapore gained formal independence on August 9, 1965, with Yusof bin Ishak serving as its first president and the highly influential Lee Kuan Yew as its prime minister.\n\nAfter independence, Singapore continued to experience problems. Much of the city-state's 3 million people were unemployed. More than two-thirds of its population was living in slums and squatter settlements on the city's fringe. The territory was sandwiched between two large and unfriendly states in Malaysia and [Indonesia](https://www.thoughtco.com/geography-of-indonesia-1435052). Singapore lacked natural resources, sanitation, proper infrastructure, and adequate water supply. In order to stimulate development, Lee sought international assistance, but his pleas went unanswered, leaving Singapore to fend for itself.\n\nGlobalizing Industry and Trade\n------------------------------\n\nDuring colonial times, Singapore's economy was centered on entrepôt trade. But this economic activity offered little prospect for job expansion in the post-colonial period. The withdrawal of the British further aggravated the unemployment situation.\n\nThe most feasible solution to Singapore's economic and unemployment woes was to embark on a comprehensive program of industrialization, with a focus on labor-intensive industries. Unfortunately, Singapore had no industrial tradition. The majority of its working population was in trade and services. Therefore, they had no expertise or easily adaptable skills. Moreover, without a hinterland and neighbors who would trade with it, Singapore was forced to look for opportunities well beyond its borders to spearhead its industrial development.\n\nPressured to find work for their people, the leaders of Singapore began to experiment with [globalization](https://www.thoughtco.com/globalization-positive-and-negative-1434946). Influenced by Israel's ability to leap over its Arab neighbors (who boycotted Israel) and trade with Europe and America, Lee and his colleagues knew they had to connect with the developed world and convince multinational corporations to manufacture in Singapore.\n\nCentralizing Government\n-----------------------\n\nIn order to attract investors, Singapore had to create an environment that was safe, corruption-free, and low in taxation. To make this feasible, the citizens of the country had to suspend a large measure of their freedom in place of a more autocratic government. Anyone caught conducting narcotic trade or intensive corruption would be met with the death penalty. Lee's People Action Party (PAP) repressed all independent labor unions and consolidated what remained into a single umbrella group called the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC), which the party directly controlled. Individuals who threatened national, political, or corporate unity were quickly jailed without much due process. The country's draconian, but business-friendly laws became very appealing to international investors. In contrast to its neighbors, where political and economic climates were unpredictable, Singapore was very stable. Moreover, with its advantageous location and established port system, Singapore was an ideal place to manufacture goods.\n\nSecuring Investors\n------------------\n\nBy 1972, just seven years after independence, one-quarter of Singapore's manufacturing firms were either foreign-owned or joint-venture companies, and both the United States and Japan were major investors. As a result of Singapore's steady climate, favorable investment conditions and the rapid expansion of the world economy from 1965 to 1972, the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) experienced annual double-digit growth.\n\nAs foreign investment money poured in, Singapore began focusing on developing its human resources in addition to its infrastructure. The country set up many technical schools and paid international corporations to train their unskilled workers in information technology, petrochemicals, and electronics. For those who could not get industrial jobs, the government enrolled them in labor-intensive un-tradable services, such as tourism and transportation. The strategy of having multinationals educate their workforce paid great dividends for the country. In the 1970s, Singapore was primarily exporting textiles, garments, and basic electronics. By the 1990s, they were engaging in wafer fabrication, logistics, biotech research, pharmaceuticals, integrated circuit design, and aerospace engineering.\n\nCreating a Market Economy\n-------------------------\n\nToday, Singapore is a modern, industrialized society and entrepôt trade continues to play a central role in its economy. The Port of Singapore is now the [world's busiest transshipment port](https://www.thoughtco.com/geography-4133035), surpassing Hong Kong and Rotterdam. In terms of total cargo tonnage handled, it has become the world's second busiest, behind only the Port of Shanghai.\n\nSingapore's tourism industry is also thriving, attracting over 10 million visitors annually. The city-state now has a zoo, a night safari, and a nature reserve. The country has opened two of the world's most expensive integrated casino resorts in the Marina Bay Sands and the Resorts World Sentosa. The country's medical tourism and culinary tourism industries have also become quite successful, thanks to Singapore's cultural heritage and advanced medical technology.\n\nBanking has grown significantly in recent years and many assets formerly held in Switzerland have been moved to Singapore due to new taxes imposed by the Swiss. The biotech industry is burgeoning, with drug makers such as GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, and Merck & Co. all establishing plants there, and oil refining continues to play a huge role in the economy.\n\nHow Singapore Has Grown\n-----------------------\n\nDespite its small size, Singapore is now the 15th largest trading partner of the United States. The country has established strong trade agreements with several countries in South America, Europe, and Asia as well. There are currently over 3,000 multinational corporations operating in the country, accounting for more than two-thirds of its manufacturing output and direct export sales.\n\nWith a total land area of just 433 square miles and a small labor force of 3 million people, Singapore is able to produce a GDP that exceeds $300 billion annually, higher than three-quarters of the world. Life expectancy is 83.75 years, the third-highest in the world. Singapore is considered to be one of the best places to live on Earth if you don't mind the strict rules.\n\nSingapore's model of sacrificing freedom for business is highly controversial and heavily debated. Regardless of philosophy, though, its effectiveness is undeniable.\n",

If you require any further assistance, please contact James Gong at [james.gong@twobirds.com](mailto:james.gong@twobirds.com) or Wilfred Ng at [wilfred.ng@twobirds.com](mailto:wilfred.ng@twobirds.com).\n\nThis is the Part II of the Article. Click [here](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2023/china/part-1-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-standard-contract-for-gba-data-transfers)to read the Part I of this Article.\n\n(See Part I of this Article)\n\n### KEY PROVISIONS AND OBSERVATIONS\n\n1.   Legal Effect and Application \n(see Part I of this Article)\n\n1.   Key Provisions\n\n**Compliance Obligations**\n\n##### Before carrying out cross-border transfers through entering into GBA SCCs, PI Processors[1] in the GBA must comply with the following actions:\n\n**1. Fully informing the PI subject and obtaining a legal basis**(such as consent): This should be carried out in accordance with the relevant local laws and regulations of the PI Processor’s jurisdiction. If the local laws and regulations do not require notification, then their provisions should be followed.\n\n**2. Conducting a Personal Information Protection Impact Assessment (“PIPIA”)**\n\nBefore carrying out cross-border transfers of PI under the GBA SCCs, PI Processors (including data users in Hong Kong) must conduct a PIPIA. The GBA SCC Guidelines do not currently stipulate that the PIPIA conducted for the purpose of entering into GBA SCCs needs to be submitted to local authorities. This remains a procedural distinction from the practice under PIPL SCCs, where the PIPIA conducted has to be submitted to the CAC together with the signed PIPL SCCs.\n\nFor data users in Hong Kong, carrying out a PIPIA is not required under the PDPO. The PCPD only recommends a non-compulsory Privacy Impact Assessment (“**PIA**”) before launching new businesses or projects that may have a significant impact on personal data privacy. However, it should be noted that the “Policy Statement on Facilitating Data Flow and Safeguarding Data Security in Hong Kong” mentioned that the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau will consider possible amendments to the PDPO to align legislation with the latest international developments in privacy protection. Thus, the PDPO may incorporate international practices and mandate PIA as a compliance requirement in certain situations.\n\n*   **Key Assessment Area**:\n    1.   The legality, legitimacy and necessity of the purposes and means, etc. of processing PI by the PI Processor and recipient (In contrast to the PIPL SCCs, the assessment of the “scope” of PI processing is not considered);\n    2.   The impact on the rights and interests of PI subjects, as well as the security risk to PI subjects (cf. the PIPL SCCs which contain more detailed requirements[2]);\n    3.   Whether the obligations undertaken by the recipient and its management and technical measures and capabilities can ensure the level of security measures to be applied to the PI in question.\n\nThe assessment of the impact of the PI protection policies and regulations of the recipient’s country or region on the performance of the standard contract is not required under the GBA SCC Guidelines which is an obligation stipulated under the PIPL SCCs. This means the GBA SCCs mechanism does not require the evaluation of the legal environment of PI protection in the recipient jurisdiction, an exercise entailed in a customary transfer impact assessment in international data transfer mechanisms.\n\n*   **PIPIA Time Limit**: In line with the PIPL SCCs guidelines, the PIPIA must be completed within three months before the filing date, and no major changes should have taken place as of the filing date.\n*   **PIPIA Template**: At present, neither the Guangdong CAC nor Hong Kong authorities have issued a PIPIA report outline or template under the GBA SCCs mechanism. We will keep a watching brief on the upcoming filing guidelines from the Guangdong CAC, which may provide guidance for PIPIA implementation for Hong Kong’s data users.\n\n**3.****Signing the GBA SCCs with the recipient according to the template**\n\nThe GBA SCCs must strictly adhere to Appendix I of the GBA SCC Guidelines. While the PI Processor can negotiate additional terms with the recipient, these terms must not contradict the GBA SCCs. In case of any discrepancies between the GBA SCCs and other legal agreements, the GBA SCCs takes precedence. For specific business arrangements, separate commercial contracts can be established.\n\nThe GBA SCCs template is currently designed for one-way data transfers. Hence, if a cross-border data exchange involves transfers from Mainland China to Hong Kong and vice versa, it would necessitate the signing of two distinct GBA SCCs to accommodate each direction of transfer.\n\nKey differences between the GBA SCCs and PIPL SCCs include:\n\n*   GBA SCCs restrict cross-border PI transfers to within the GBA, unlike the PIPL SCCs.\n*   GBA SCCs have relaxed requirements for providing PI to GBA third parties, with no need to ensure their activities meet China’s PI protection standards or to provide individuals with copies of agreements with the third party.\n*   GBA SCCs have removed clauses concerning the impact of the local PI protection policies and regulations of the recipient’s country or region on contract performance. If local policy or regulation changes prevent the recipient from fulfilling the GBA SCCs, the recipient can't unilaterally terminate the GBA SCCs.\n*   GBA SCCs emphasise the application of local laws, e.g., informing individuals and obtaining consent must comply with local laws. In disputes, individuals can choose to apply the laws of the PI Processor's jurisdiction and file lawsuits in Mainland China or Hong Kong based on their respective laws\n\nAs per Article 6 of the GBA SCC Guidelines, cross-border PI transfers may only occur once the GBA SCCs are effective.Additionally, a filing with the local regulatory authority is required within ten working days from the GBA SCCs’ effective date, and a filing reference number must be obtained before any cross-border PI transfer, as confirmed with the Guangdong CAC.\n\n**4. Filing the GBA SCCs with the local regulatory authority**\n\n*   Who is responsible for the Filing?\n\nUnder GBA SCCs, both PI Processors and recipients shall file with their local authorities, unlike PIPL SCCs where only Mainland PI Processors are required to file. This measure may be to monitor recipients’ implementation based on the GBA SCCs, especially in relation to data onward transfers within the GBA.\n\nThe Guangdong CAC has indicated that one party filing under GBA SCCs may suffice, but this requires Hong Kong authorities’ confirmation. Notably, the OGCIO issued the Filing Guidelines on the Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)[3] (“**Hong Kong Filing Guidelines**”), which are silent on this issue but have referred to two separate sets of filing procedures for both Hong Kong-based PI Processors and recipients. Whether this in practice means a Hong Kong recipient is expected to conduct a local filing in addition to the CAC filing already made by a PI Processor based in Mainland China remains to be seen.\n\nFor Hong Kong data users and recipients, using the GBA SCCs mechanism means increased filing responsibilities. However, the PCPD’s RMCs[[4]](file:///C:/Users/jwrl/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/2EI13Z19/Save%20the%20Best%20for%20Last%20--%20All%20You%20need%20to%20Know%20about%20the%20Standard%20Contract%20for%20GBA%20Data%20Transfers%20(Part%20II)%20-%20EN%20-%20BB.docx#_ftn4) which are more concise and flexible than GBA SCCs, do not require filing with the regulatory authority.\n\n*   Which regulatory authority will handle the Filing? \nPI Processors and recipients shall file with the Guangdong CAC or the OGCIO in the Hong Kong according to their respective jurisdictions and submit the required filing documents.\n\nThe Hong Kong Filing Guidelines are only applicable to contracting parties in Hong Kong, including data users or recipients.\n\nThe Guangdong CAC is expected to issue filing guidelines in the near future, which will be applicable to PI Processors and recipients in the nine Mainland cities of the GBA.\n\n*   Filing Documents\n    1.   Photocopy of Identity proof of the legal representatives\n    2.   Undertaking (see Template at Appendix II of the GBA SCC Guidelines); and \n    3.   The GBA SCCs (Chinese version).\n\nHong Kong OGCIO has provided a separate application form for filing, and the Guangdong CAC may also develop corresponding filing application forms, requiring PI Processors to provide their contact information.\n\nPending confirmation from upcoming the Guangdong CAC filing guidelines, it appears that the above filing documents do not require a PIPIA report, suggesting more flexibility in the PIPIA of the GBA SCCs in form and content compared to the PIPIA under the PIPL SCCs. Despite this, authorities may still review the PIPIA report during cross-border transfers and request rectification depending on the situation.\n\n*   Filing Process\nThe filing process may include the submission of documents, the checking of documents, notification of filing results, the provision of supplementary information and carrying out the re-filing procedures.\n\n    1.   Submission of Documents: the parties shall conduct the filing procedures within ten working days from the effective date of the GBA SCCs.\n    2.   Feedback timeline: The feedback timeline for Mainland parties is pending the release of the relevant rules by Guangdong CAC. The Hong Kong Filing Guidelines outline the following filing procedure timeline:\n        *   For data user applications, the OGCIO will provide filing results within ten working days of receiving filing documents. If approved, a filing reference number will be issued. If not, the data user will be notified, and it may re-file with supplementary documents within ten working days. \n        *   For recipient applications, the OGCIO will acknowledge receipt and document completeness within ten working days of receiving filing documents.\n\n##### During the effective term of the GBA SCCs, PI Processors and recipients in the GBA should perform the following obligations:\n\n**1. PI Processors in the GBA should promptly re-conduct a PIPIA, enter into a supplemental agreement or a new GBA SCCs, and conduct the corresponding filing procedures, should the following occur:**\n\n*   The purpose, scope, categories, means, or the recipient’s use and means of PI processing changes, or the retention period is extended. (Compared to the PIPL SCCs, changes in sensitivity and retention location are not mentioned.)\n*   The occurrence of any other circumstances that affect or may affect the rights and interests in relation to PI. (Compared to the PIPL SCCs, changes in the PI protection policies and regulations of the recipient’s country or region that may affect PI rights and interests are not mentioned. This aligns with the GBA SCCs’ PIPIA, which does not require an assessment of the legal environment of the recipient’s country or region.)\n\n**2. PI Processors and recipients in the GBA shall be supervised and managed by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdiction concerned.**\n\nBelow is a brief introduction of regulatory authorities in Hong Kong regarding their hierarchy and responsibilities related to cross-border data flows in the GBA:\n\n![Image 1](blob:http://localhost/abc1b683964c534fae4f0996076041a5)\n\nThe OGCIO’s responsibilities for GBA SCC Guidelines implementation include:\n\n*   Issuing guidance on GBA SCCs implementation and Pilot Implementation. \n*   Accepting GBA SCCs filings from Hong Kong contracting parties and the Express of Interest Form for Pilot Implementation.\n*   Handling complaints and reports about improper performance of GBA SCC Guidelines obligations. \n*   Taking follow-up actions on GBA SCC Guidelines violations, including requesting necessary rectification from the PI Processor or recipient. \n*   Collaborating with the PCPD, and referring PDPO violation cases to the PCPD for further investigation and handling.\n\nPI Processors and recipients in the GBA shall accept supervision and management by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdiction concerned during the implementation of the GBA SCCs, specifically including:\n\n*   PI Processors must respond to regulatory enquiries, prove GBA SCCs obligations fulfilment, and must notify authorities when terminating GBA SCCs (PIPL SCCs only require notification as necessary).\n*   Recipients are supervised by regulatory authorities and must answer enquiries, cooperate with inspections, comply with decisions, and provide proof of actions taken. If local government or judicial bodies request PI under GBA SCCs, it shall notify PI Processor immediately.\n*   In case of a security incident such as a PI breach, immediate remedial measures must be taken and regulatory authorities must be notified. The GBA SCCs and PIPL SCCs have identical notification contents.\n\nRegulatory authorities may request rectification from PI Processors or recipients if high security risks or incidents are identified in the cross-border processing of PI. Cases requiring involvement of other law enforcement will be referred in accordance with the law.\n\nThe roles of Mainland and Hong Kong’s data protection authorities in enhancing data protection, handling complaints, investigating, and addressing unlawful data processing remain unaffected by these rules.\n\nIf a Hong Kong recipient violates the GBA SCC Guidelines by transferring PI outside the GBA, the OGCIO will follow up on reports or complaints. They may require rectification, with the recipient expected to cooperate, comply, and provide proof of actions taken. If there is any behaviour in violation of the PDPO, the PCPD will follow up and handle the case according to the PDPO.\n\n**Implementation Measures**\n\nThe OGCIO of Hong Kong intended to launch a Pilot Implementation of the GBA SCCs in December 2023, with the first phase openly inviting participants from banking, credit referencing and healthcare sectors. The Hong Kong government will review the Pilot Implementation in due course and expand the facilitation measures to other sectors.\n\nIndividuals or enterprises who are interested in participating in the Pilot Implementation must submit their Expression of Interest Form before December 31, 2023.\n\nAccording to the Expression of Interest Form, any PI Processor or recipient can apply to participate, regardless of industry, and applicants are not limited to banks, credit referencing, and healthcare sectors. In addition, individual PI Processors or recipients can also participate in the Pilot Implementation.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nThe clear policy intention of the GBA SCC Guidelines to facilitate the transfer of PI from Mainland China to Hong Kong should be understood in the context of any potential impact on the compliance costs. Examples discussed above include the need to conduct the PIPIA for Hong Kong data users and the need for both Mainland China and Hong Kong-based parties to file with their respective local authorities.\n\nIt is important to note that Mainland China-based PI Processors can still export data via the existing mechanism pursuant to the PIPL. If data flow does not need to extend beyond the GBA, they can opt for GBA SCCs or GBA Certification mechanisms as needed. They should monitor Guangdong CAC’s upcoming filing guidelines and regulatory development on potential exemptions of the data export compliance obligations.\n\nFor Hong Kong data users transferring data to Mainland China, the need to rely on the GBA SCCs will inevitably be a case-by-case assessment. This is likely to depend on the organisation’s existing compliance logic for international data transfers, particularly if intra-group data transfer impact assessment and transfer agreements can be leveraged upon, which will be a natural option for mitigating against any additional potential compliance cost. Relevant stakeholders are advised to monitor any upcoming PDPO revisions and participate in the Pilot Implementation to provide feedback.\n\n* * *\n\n[1]According to the GBA SCCs, PI Processors, for the Mainland China, refers to an organisation or individual that autonomously determines the purposes and means of PI processing; for the HKSAR, it also covers a “data user” which, in relation to personal data, means a person who, either alone or jointly or in common with other persons, controls the collection, holding, processing or use of the data.\n\n[2]The PIPL SCCs also requires PI Processors to assess the risks in more detail, including the quantity, scope, type, and sensitivity of PI to be transferred overseas, and the risk that the outbound cross-border transfer may pose to PI rights and interests; the risk of the PI being tampered with, sabotaged, disclosed, lost, or illegally used after the it is transferred overseas, and whether there is a smooth channel for protecting the rights and interests in the PI.\n\n[3][Filing Guidelines on the Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (ogcio.gov.hk)](https://www.ogcio.gov.hk/en/our_work/business/cross-boundary_data_flow/doc/gbascc02_fg_en.pdf)\n",

On February 18th, 2019, the Chinese Government issued its Outline Development Plan for the GBA, which intends to guide current and future developments within an ecosystem integrated both physically and digitally.\n\nWith a total GDP of USD 1.56 trillion, the size of the GBA economy is close to Russia’s, larger than Australia’s, and just behind that of Korea.\n\nGuangdong Province alone generates 14% of China national GDP; and the Pearl River Delta region is now the largest urban area in the world, overtaking Tokyo. The goal of the GBA initiative is to create a city cluster offering regional competitive advantages, rivaling with those of New York, San Francisco, or Tokyo.\n\nThe GBA brings unique opportunities for tech companies and aims to become a world-class center for innovation, science and technology, infrastructural connectivity, financial integration and social betterment with smart cities and an advanced manufacturing and IT powerhouse.\n\nThere are four important areas in which the Outline Development Plan intends to foster cooperation: Innovation & Technology, Infrastructural Connectivity, Financial Integration, and Social Betterment.\n\nRegarding the first one, the idea is to develop the “Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macao” innovation and technology corridor and major carriers for innovation such as the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park.\n\nThe second one would seek to connect the Mainland with Hong Kong and Macao, as well as connecting the east and west coasts of the Pearl River Delta and build a rapid inter-city transport network mainly focused on high-speed rails, inter-city railway and highways.\n\nThe financial integration would promote cross-boundary transactions of insurance products within the Greater Bay Area, establishing a mechanism for mutual access to capital and products, and support Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao insurance institutions in developing cross-boundary RMB reinsurance business.\n\nThe area of social betterment is meant to support Hong Kong and Macao investors in setting up pension and other social services facilities through sole proprietorship, joint-venture, cooperation, etc. in the nine municipalities in accordance with regulations.\n\n[![Image 2: Can Woodburn help you?](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f1b14b_3f4d1f773f3947fe9e5a0d400c054fdd~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_350,h_350,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/f1b14b_3f4d1f773f3947fe9e5a0d400c054fdd~mv2.png)](https://meetings.hubspot.com/kristina12?uuid=6e853743-b6d2-476f-8026-a185209f5a6e)\n\nThe GBA plan will offer Hong Kong the possibility of redefining its role as an international financial center. Thanks to its status as international connector, Hong Kong should naturally be able to promote the GBA initiative overseas and attract more capital and talents therein.\n\nOn the other hand, Hong Kong should take advantage of its financial leadership and of the opportunities offered by the 9 Mainland Chinese cities of the GBA in terms of market reach, industrial system, and technological developments.\n\nThe GBA has the potential to extend its reach beyond the Pearl River Delta region. In the longer term, it should be able to act as a catalyst for China’s broader Belt and Road Initiative, where Hong Kong should strengthen its role as a global offshore RMB center.\n\nOne of the challenges is cross-border payments and transfers of data, regional taxation, and regulations on foreign-direct investments. The example of data transfers illustrates the complexity of the issue: while Hong Kong regulations on data privacy try to draw a balance between the protection of individuals and the promotion of trade and economic developments, China Cybersecurity Law emphasizes the protection of national interest and security.\n\nThanks to the size and economic potential of the GBA, numerous sectors will see as well in increase of opportunities, such as infrastructure, construction, real estate, financial services, insurance, capital markets, and many others.\n\nTo fully take advantage of these opportunities, businesses should carefully evaluate the potential impacts of GBA integration and develop comprehensive business policies based on the connectivity of the area and flows of goods, talent, and resources within it.\n\nThe policy framework of the GBA is ambitious, dynamic, and subject to interpretation and negotiation by policy actors at different levels. Its progress is supported by a triple “I” strategy of integration, innovation, and internationalization.\n\nThe initiative aims to promote China’s two Special Administration Regions’ economic and cultural integration with the Chinese mainland under the “one country, two systems” framework. Deeper cooperation for Hong Kong, Macao, and the mainland will be mutually beneficial.\n\nThe GBA constitutes part of a nationwide regional development strategy framework to build an innovation economy. China will pursue a structural rebalancing from a labor intensive, low investment, export-oriented economy to a high-tech manufacturing, and service-based economy that relies more on domestic consumption.\n\n[![Image 3: Short articles](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f1b14b_20566a381dff4fdc93129e7cd1fe3f99~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_350,h_350,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/f1b14b_20566a381dff4fdc93129e7cd1fe3f99~mv2.png)](https://www.woodburnglobal.com/woodburn-short-articles)\n\nThanks to the GBA’s leading industries in manufacturing, financial services, and technological innovation, the region represents a new momentum for China’s economic growth, a new channel for it to be engaged with the global economy and thereby a new engine for China’s economic growth. The GBA also serves as a catalyst for promoting China’s economic internationalization. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China stressed that “Openness brings progress, while self-seclusion leaves one behind”.\n\nAs the most open region to the outside world, the Greater Bay Area has an advantage in global economic positioning and it will play a key role in the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as shoulder the responsibility of piloting more reforms to help China internationalize its economy.\n\n**Woodburn Accountants & Advisors is one of China’s most trusted business setup advisory firms.**\n\nWoodburn Accountants & Advisors is specialized in inbound investment to China and Hong Kong.

Today, the city-state is home to a high-income, globally competitive economy that is underpinned by one of the highest levels of human capital development in the world.\n\n*   [Singapore Home](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore \"Singapore Home\")\n*   [Overview](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore/overview \"Overview\")\n\nOverview\n--------\n\n*   [Summary](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore/overview#1)\n*   [Partnership](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore/overview#2)\n*   [Operations](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore/overview#3)\n\nSingapore is a high-income economy built on a business-friendly regulatory environment and strong investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and public services. The city-state is among the world’s most competitive economies and ranks highest in the 2020 World Bank Human Capital Index.\n\nIn the decades after independence in 1965, Singapore rapidly developed from a low-income economy to a high-income economy. GDP growth in the city-state has been among the world’s highest, at an average of about 7% since independence and topping 9.2% in the first 25 years.\n\nAfter rapid industrialization in the 1960s lifted the island nation’s development trajectory, manufacturing became the main driver of growth. In the early 1970s, Singapore reached full employment and joined the ranks of Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, China, a decade later as Asia’s newly industrializing economies. The manufacturing and services sectors remain the twin pillars of Singapore’s high value-added economy.\n\nThe overall growth of the Singapore economy was 1.1% in 2023. Construction (+5.2% y-o-y) led the growth in goods- producing industries, driven by expansions in both public and private sector projects. Services industries registered broad-based growth, led by accommodation (+12.1% y-o-y), and information and communications (+5.7% y-o-y) on the back of strong international visitor arrivals and robust demand for data hosting services, respectively. Economic growth is expected to be modest in 2024, with the government forecasting a range of 1% to 3%.\n\nIn February 2021, Singapore launched the “Singapore Green Plan 2030”, a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore's national agenda on sustainable development. The Green Plan charts ambitious and concrete targets over a 10-year period, strengthening Singapore's commitments under the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and Paris Agreement, and positioning Singapore to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nIn the most recent [World Bank Human Capital Index](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital), Singapore ranks as the best in the world in human capital development. Together with strong financial support from the government, the city-state continues to strengthen the nimbleness and flexibility of its workforce by providing continuing education such as the [_Skillsfuture_](http://www.skillsfuture.sg/) initiative.\n\n_Last updated: July 2024_\n\nSingapore became the 104th member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) on August 3, 1966. Prior to joining the World Bank Group, Singapore received its first loan in 1963 under guarantee from the U.K. government, and its second loan under guarantee from the Malaysian Federation, to which it then belonged. It received its third loan in 1966 after independence.\n\nOver the period 1963 and 1975, Singapore received 14 loans from the World Bank. All of the first 10 were for infrastructure, including water supply, port expansion, sewerage, power, and telecommunications.\n\nBy 1970, Singapore’s development focus expanded to investments in human capital and the services sector. The World Bank supported the capitalization of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), the establishment of environmental management programs, and the development of the national university while continuing to finance infrastructure projects. Singapore received its last financing from the World Bank in 1975. By the mid-1980s, it had repaid all its loans.\n\nToday, Singapore is a member of all five World Bank Group institutions and an important contributor to global initiatives such as the[Global Infrastructure Facility](http://www.globalinfrafacility.org/) and the Climate Action Data Trust, as well as regional initiatives, such as the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility. It inspires many cities and countries striving to reach a similar level of development within a single generation.\n\nIn 1999, the World Bank Group opened its Singapore Office, in order to share knowledge with local networks. In 2009, it expanded the office with the establishment of the[World Bank–Singapore Urban Hub](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/singapore/brief/world-bank-group-singapore-urban-hub), which seeks to leverage the city-state’s expertise in sustainable urban development.\n\nTo strengthen its engagement with the private sector, in 2011 the partnership was expanded to include representatives from the[International Finance Corporation (IFC)](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home)(the private sector arm of the World Bank Group) and the[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)](https://www.miga.org/) (the arm of the institution that guarantees loans against political and risks). The Hub’s expansion continued, to include the Corporate Finance and Risk Management unit, IFC Treasury, IFC’s[Asset Management Company](https://www.ifcamc.org/), and the[Global Infrastructure Facility](http://www.globalinfrafacility.org/), among others.\n\nIn 2015,[the World Bank–Singapore Hub for Infrastructure and Urban Development](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/10/27/singapore-world-bank-group-agree-to-establish-major-infrastructure-and-urban-development-hub)expanded again recognizing the importance of high-quality, sustainable infrastructure and Singapore’s unique strength in facilitating opportunities for emerging and developing economies. In 2022, it added IBRD Treasury services, including sustainable finance; asset management; and client solutions, including the Reserve Advisory & Management Partnership program (RAMP), to support staff and clients across the East Asia and Pacific region.\n\nThe partnership between the World Bank Group and Singapore focuses on areas of mutual interest—including sustainable finance, global public goods, and long-term investments in infrastructure and human capital—with the aim of promoting broad-based economic growth across the region and combating the effects of climate change. The shared goal is to deliver knowledge and solutions to development challenges at impact and scale, in support of the World Bank Group’s mission to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity on a livable planet.\n\n_Last updated: April 2025_\n\nThe Singapore Office houses about 300 staff from the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA, making it one of the larger World Bank Group offices outside Washington, DC. It is a gateway through which clients across Asia access the full suite of Bank Group services.\n\nAs of the end of FY24, the Singapore Office managed more than $38 billion of World Bank lending operations and infrastructure verticals across Asia. Projects address cross-cutting global challenges such as climate change, energy transition, water security, air pollution, food security, and others. Teams based in Singapore also coordinate regional initiatives, such as the Southeast Asia Regional Program on Combating Marine Plastics.\n\nIFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, focuses on advancing cross-border investments and mobilizing capital from and through Singapore. It works closely with Monetary Authority of Singapore and other institutions to promote sustainability-linked investments and blended finance deployment to address climate financing gaps, scale up disruptive technologies, and incubate new business models. Examples of ongoing collaboration between IFC and Singapore include Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership (FAST-P) and the advancement of digital inclusion in emerging markets and developing countries.\n\nMIGA, the guarantees arm of the World Bank Group, seeks to promote foreign direct investments into developing countries to support economic growth. MIGA engages closely with the financing, investing, and insurance communities in Singapore to mobilize private capital for public goods by providing political risk insurance, credit guarantees, and trade finance guarantees for public sector risks. It also collaborates on relevant Singapore-led climate and infrastructure financing initiatives.\n\nThe World Bank Group is a regular contributor to Singapore’s flagship knowledge events, such as the[World Cities Summit](https://www.worldcitiessummit.com.sg/), the Asia Infrastructure Forum, Singapore[International Water Week](https://www.siww.com.sg/), Singapore[International Energy Week](https://www.siew.sg/programme/associated-events/energy-access-forum), [Ecosperity Week](https://www.ecosperity.sg/), and [Singapore Maritime Week](https://www.smw.sg/). At Singapore International Water Week 2024, the World Bank Group and the Singapore government launched the[Singapore Water Center](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water/brief/SingaporeWaterCenter). Located within the World Bank Group Singapore Office, the center leverages Singapore’s expertise in urban water management to foster innovation, knowledge exchange, and capacity development among policymakers, utility managers, and stakeholders in the water sector. It integrates advancements in policy, technology, and finance to tackle pressing water security challenges both regionally and globally. The Center offers training programs, joint studies, and pilot projects aimed at sustainable water solutions.\n\nThe World Bank Group, Infrastructure Asia, and Singapore Management University jointly developed a bespoke thematic course titled “Growing Infrastructure: Enabling & Structuring for Private Sector Participation in Finance and Innovation,” which builds leadership capabilities within the infrastructure sector across Southeast Asia and South Asia. Over 250 regional government officials have attended the training program since it began in 2020.\n\nLooking ahead, the Group Singapore Office will support the newly launched World Bank Group Academy, which aims to facilitate deeper engagement with clients through technical exchange, peer-to-peer learning, and the identification of good practices and proven solutions.\n\n_Last updated: April 2025_\n\nRELATED\n-------\n\n*   [Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)\n\n* * *\n\nAROUND THE BANK GROUP\n---------------------\n\nFind out what the Bank Group's branches are doing in Singapore.\n\n*   [IFC](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/region__ext_content/regions/east+asia+and+the+pacific/countries/ifc+in+singapore)\n\n* * *\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n--------------\n\n*   [![Image 6: facebook logo](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr-redesign/icons/fb.svg)Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WorldBank)\n*   [![Image 7: twitter logo](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr-redesign/icons/twitter.svg)Twitter](https://twitter.com/WB_AsiaPacific)\n*   [![Image 8: instagram logo](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr-redesign/icons/instagram.svg)Instagram](https://instagram.com/worldbank)\n*   [![Image 9: flickr logo](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr-redesign/icons/flickr.svg)Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/WorldBank)\n*   [![Image 10: youtube logo](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr-redesign/icons/youtube.svg)YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6706EF7A6A128C66)\n*   [![Image 11: blogs logo](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/stayconnected/icons-blogs.svg)Blog](https://blogs.worldbank.org/search?keyword=&f%5B0%5D=countries%3A221)\n*   [![Image 12: rss logo](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/stayconnected/icons-rss.svg)RSS](https://search.worldbank.org/api/v2/news?format=atom&countrycode_exact=SG)\n*   [![Image 13: newsletter logo](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/stayconnected/sm-icons-newsletter.svg)Sign up for email updates](https://www.worldbank.org/en/newsletter-subscription?email=&subscribe=SUBMIT&lang=en)\n\nAdditional Resources\n--------------------\n\n### Related\n\n*   [World Bank East Asia Pacific](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eap)\n*   [Office of the Executive Director for Singapore](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/leadership/directors/eds16)\n\n### Contacts\n\nWorld Bank Group Singapore Office\n\n 10 Marina Boulevard, Marina Bay Financial Center, Tower 2, #12-01 Singapore 018983\n\n (65) 6517 1240\n\n[worldbank_singapore@worldbank.org](mailto:worldbank_singapore@worldbank.org)\n\n*   [![Image 14: World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/media_1540be393bca9ed1fbc89eaa862044ccb08019dd2.svg?width=750&format=svg&optimize=medium)](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home \"World Bank\")\n\n*   [IBRD](https://www.worldbank.org/en/who-we-are/ibrd \"IBRD\")\n*   [IDA](https://ida.worldbank.org/en/home \"IDA\")\n*   [IFC](https://www.ifc.org/en/home \"IFC\")\n*   [MIGA](https://www.miga.org/ \"MIGA\")\n*   [ICSID](https://icsid.worldbank.org/ \"ICSID\")\n\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/worldbank)\n*   [](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaeLyAgAojYvg7Wbr91k)\n*   [](https://x.com/worldbank)\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-world-bank/)\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/worldbank/)\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/user/WorldBank)\n*   [](https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/)\n\n*   [Who We Are](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/who-we-are \"Who We Are\")\n*   [News](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news \"News\")\n*   [Careers](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/careers \"Careers\")\n*   [Contact](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/contacts \"Contact\")\n\n*   [Countries](https://www.worldbank.org/en/where-we-work \"Countries\")\n*   [Topics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic \"Topics\")\n*   [Projects & Operations](https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/projects-home?lang=en \"Projects & Operations\")\n*   [Research & Publications](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research \"Research & Publications\")\n\n*   [Events](https://www.worldbank.org/en/events/all \"Events\")\n*   [Data](https://data.worldbank.org/ \"Data\")\n*   [WBG Academy](https://academy.worldbank.org/en/home \"WBG Academy\")\n*   [Results Scorecard](https://scorecard.worldbank.org/en/scorecard/home \"Results Scorecard\")\n\n*   **STAY CURRENT** WITH OUR LATEST DATA & INSIGHTS\n\n*   [Sign Up](https://www.worldbank.org/en/newsletter-subscription \"Sign Up\")\n\n*   © 2025 World Bank Group.
