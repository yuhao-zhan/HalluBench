It argues that, since this country's independence in the 1960s, its state owned enterprises SOEs have both been run in a manner conducive to commercial viability and highly aligned with governmental economic priorities. This ‘commercially viable strategic alignment’, largely absent in SOEs worldwide, has favored cautious privatization and thus the maintenance of a strong SOE sector in Singapore.",

While recent political backlash from investing abroad has led the government to apparently distance itself from SOEs and Temasek – the SOE holding company turned investment fund – their role in developing venture capital and entrepreneurship – both governmental priorities – suggests that a ‘strategic alignment’ remains. Drawing from their substantial financial resources, these entities complement other government efforts in terms of funding, being important players in the Singaporean venture capital markets and have even directly and indirectly invested in Singapore's most successful high growth companies. In addition, due to their presence in global networks and the complimentary assets they possess, such as access to customers and intellectual property, they provide investees with resources that facilitate their growth and increase their likelihood of succeeding.",

Most existing studies on the convergence and competition of the manufacturing structure in the Greater Bay Area lack a comprehensive measurement and analysis from the perspective of the metropolitan circle by using multiple indicators in multiple dimensions, especially the intra city division of labor. This paper addresses the gap by examining the structural convergence, industrial competition, and cooperation networks, specialization, and labor division in the manufacturing sector of mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area for the years 2011, 2016, and 2021.",

      "chunk_text": "COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN SINGAPORE IGENERAL BACKGROUND Not infrequently political as well as legal philosophers would, where it is politically convenient, try to rationalize the State’s arbitrary power in expropriating private rights in land for public purposes by having recourse to some ideological scales. Unfortunately, the fact that the concept of compulsory land acquisition is getting substantial recognition in countries having social orders that are opposed to each other would appear to have exposed the futility of their efforts. What is nearer to the truth is that compulsory land acquisition, like many other legal and sociological concepts espoused by political elites all over the world seek ing a happy medium between the extremes of all private and all State ownership, is borne of practical necessity rather than any socialistic theory.",

That land acquisition is for public benefit does not necessarily mean it will create a wider diffusion of ownership. It would therefore appear more appropriate and safer if one stops at such abstract but convenient maxims like salus populi est suprema lex that the welfare of the people or of the public is the paramount law and necessitas publica major est quam privata public necessity is greater than private . About 140 years ago, when the East India Company was the overlord in the Colony of Singapore, the general land policy was dictated by a sheer desire to create more revenue by granting to the subjects land tenure in one form or another.",

Some consider it unfair to the landowner to have picked the date of the publication of the Declaration as the material date es pecially when proceedings are protracted and land value escalating rapidly.",

Singapore’s trading history began in 1819 when the British East India Company established it as a trading settlement from which the British could extend their political and economic influence into East Asia. This historical positioning of Singapore as a place of trade, as well as a strong economy and intelligent work force, served as incentives for MNCs to invest and even base themselves in the internationalized country.",

Singapore encouraged MNC development with hopes that investments from developed countries would introduce modern technology and the quality of life that inherently follows from technological advancement. MNCs flocked to Singapore because telecommunications allowed them to hold coordinated offices across the globe. Companies were also better able to manage the Asian market from within; they had better market access and did not have to contend with import regulations.",
