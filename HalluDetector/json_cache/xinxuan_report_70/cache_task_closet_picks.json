Directed by Edward Yang, the story unfolds on an expansive canvas to offer a complex portrait of Taiwanese identity and covers its vast array of themes through the brewing conflict between two youth gangs. Yang doesn't hurry through the proceedings, allows the atmosphere to setup gradually, provides sufficient breathing space to our multitudes of characters and captures the tragedy with tenderness & poignancy.

In my head I imagine a scene that isn't in the movie, but I wish it was, where Ming and Zhen are sitting together under a banyan tree in some park, and he gives her something, a hairpin maybe, they talk about some everyday things, and then when it comes to the scene where Zhen lunges at Ming with that knife, the hairpin or whatever falls down and he picks it up, that would be my favorite connection to the ending. I have read some reviews here and there is a review by a Chinese friend who told me about the history of the political events in the movie. I wanna say thank you to him/her, clearly the value of this movie in the flow of world history is very precious.",

At first, watching these actions performed in full seems a touch unnerving this is something that many people have carried out hundreds of times, but we have never before been forced to pay attention to the monotony of daily chores in such detail. However, holding these shots for so long draws the viewer in even further, making them concentrate on every action, so that when even the smallest cracks appear in Jeanne's monotonous routine, it appears to be almost earth shattering, just as the effect this has on Jeanne is equally momentous.

Just as I daydream when I do housework, so does my mind wander while watching Jeanne Dielman of 23 quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles cook the potatoes. People retreat to their thoughts when they do this stuff in real life, and they retreat when you faithfully reproduce it on screen. The film can't possibly engage me politically or emotionally as art if I'm spending the entire run time thinking about whether I get paid this Friday and what I'm going to cook for dinner.",
