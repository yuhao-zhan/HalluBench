Through powerful self learning and computing capabilities, the solution improved multiple production indicators and obtained complete scheduling results within minutes instead of the hours it previously took.",

The first part was needed due to the sparsity of the yield data available during the research and development R&D process for new seeds. It was owned by the R&D function at the firm and provided yield probability distributions as inputs to the optimization protocol of the second part, which was owned by the production function.
