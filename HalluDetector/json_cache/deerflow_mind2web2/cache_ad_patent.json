A computing device used by a remote operator may receive a request for assistance from a vehicle that indicates the vehicle is stopped at a first location with one or more navigation options for enabling the vehicle to navigate from the first location to a second location. At least one navigation option includes a maneuver technique that requires operator approval prior to execution. The computing device may then display a graphical user interface GUI that conveys the one or more navigation options.",
