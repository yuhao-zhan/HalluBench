This has motivated several solutions for posterior inference relying on sampling based strategies or on deterministic approximations that, however, still experience computational and accuracy issues, especially in high dimensions.

However, existing BNNs neglect the intrinsic bilinear relationship of real valued weights and scale factors, resulting in a sub optimal model caused by an insufficient training process. To address this issue, Recurrent Bilinear Optimization is proposed to improve the learning process of BNNs RBONNs by associating the intrinsic bilinear variables in the back propagation process. Our work is the first attempt to optimize BNNs from the bilinear perspective.",

Specifically, we employ a recurrent optimization and Density ReLU to sequentially backtrack the sparse real valued weight filters, which will be sufficiently trained and reach their performance limits based on a controllable learning process. We obtain robust RBONNs, which show impressive performance over state of the art BNNs on various models and datasets. Particularly, on the task of object detection, RBONNs have great generalization performance.",
